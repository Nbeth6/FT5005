# FT5005 Group 5 Data Folder

Dear team,

Download the data and put it in this folder. your import in the notebooks should be `data/the_data_path/the_data_file.csv`. Each notebook already have the data path written in there. **Don't change it**. It will keep collaboration a lot easier. Also, please dont push any csv files to the repo. If you need to put any new data into the data folder please let me know. 

The data could be found here:
