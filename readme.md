# FT5005 Group 5 Code Base

This repo contains all the code for our project. Each notebook will have some basic guidelines to what we all have to do. Feel free to deviate where appropriate. A few things to keep in mind.

1. The data file use for building the code should be model_building_data.csv
2. The values in the datafile will have been scaled so the values itself might not make sense much
3. The real file will be a lot cleaner.
4. There will be more columns in the real file
5. *IMPORTANT*: The Y-values were not lagged yet. It should be lagged by *you* as I dont know how many periods do you want to look back for lagged variables. DO NOT FORGET TO LAG THIS. For CAR you do not have to lag it. But for Revenue, you will definitely have to lag it.
6. Write everything in functions. The models will be retrained 1-2 days before report submission. So compiling them into functions keep it more readable and allow someone else to compile and run in a `.py` file later.

If I have stressed a certain output format of the file, please stick to that format. This will allow for a more standardised approach.
