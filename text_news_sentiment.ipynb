    "The news are given as different news across all dates with a list of companies in a field. We will need to accumulate this up to a quarter level by company.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the very basic form we basically want the output to be a csv file in the format below. (ideally order by quarter_year then by ticker but doesn't matter). `news_sentiment` should be values between 0 to 1 where the value vaguely represents the probability of a positive sentiment. Or -1 to 1 where -1 is neg and 1 is pos. This depends on you but *make it clear with a markdown at the end.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| ticker | quarter_year  | news_sentiment |\n",
    "|--------|---------------|----------------|\n",
    "| BAC    | Q1 2001       | 0.2            |\n",
    "| JPM    | Q1 2001       | 0.67           |\n",
    "| WFC    | Q1 2001       | 0.97           |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course some averaging will be needed so to prevent data loss, you could have multiple columns representing upper quartile sentiment, mean sentiment lower quartile sentiment for example. Perhaps news closer to announcement date might affect CAR more than older news so you might take the average of the most recent 3 news before annoucement. These are just some ideas to get you started but its completely up to you. You will need to gauge how to aggregate this up. Ideally, you should have 2 output files; 1 for revenue and 1 for CAR.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you could also explore the use of LLMs and prompt engineering to extract specific information from the text first. For example, you could look into using LLMs to extract company specific news vs market news. Both news will affect revenue prediction but the latter should not affect CAR prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be creative!"

         "Ara Mahdessian and Vahe Kuzoyan had a simple plan after graduating from college: Write some software that could assist their dads with all the paperwork that comes with being a contractor. Two decades later, that idea has morphed into a Glendale company called ServiceTitan, which last year served some 8,000 plumbing, HVAC, janitorial and other firms with a soup-to-nuts software suite — and now plans to go public on Nasdaq under the ticker “TTAN.” The tech company, which has raised about $1.4 billion in funding since its 2007 founding, did not disclose in the Nov. 18 filing how many shares it plans to sell or how much capital it wants to raise. A spokesperson declined to comment. The initial public offering of stock marks a significant step for the company, which had filed confidential paperwork for an $18-billion offering in 2022, according to Business Insider, but didn’t move forward after the Federal Reserve sharply raised interest rates to combat inflation, freezing up the IPO market. ServiceTitan — which makes most of its money charging a subscription for its services — reported revenue of $614 million in the fiscal year that ended Jan. 31, up nearly a third from a year earlier; and a loss of $195 million, 28% less than in fiscal 2023. It had about $147 million in cash and equivalents on hand as of Jan. 31, 2024, and was carrying $175 million in long-term net debt. The company, which serves contractors nationwide, says it wants to expand the number of trades and markets it serves. It employed 2,870 workers as of July 31 at its Glendale headquarters and t offices elsewhere in the U.S. and internationally. ServiceTitan has developed a web-based software that can manage all aspects of a contractor’s business, including booking appointments, generating estimates, processing invoices as well as payroll and dispatching workers. Clients range in size from family-owned contractors to large national franchises. It estimates it receives about 1% of what its clients charge their own customers, which totaled $62 billion in the 12 months that ended July 31. Competitors include BuildOps , Housecall Pro, Jobber and other companies that charge subscriptions for their web-based business management software. The founders immigrated to the United States in the 1980s as children: Mahdessian, 39, from Iran and Kuzoyan, 41, from Armenia. Mahdessian’s father started a contracting business, and Kuzoyan’s, plumbing. Mahdessian went off to Stanford and Kuzoyan got into USC, with the pair meeting at an Armenian students event. After graduation, they started in 2007 building a simple program to track customer calls and marketing budgets, but their venture soon attracted other contractors. The duo scored a seed round of funding from Mucker Capital in 2014. ServiceTitan also has gone on to make acquisitions and raise more than $1 billion from Iconiq Growth , Bessemer Venture Partners, Battery Ventures and others. Iconiq is the largest institutional shareholder of ServiceTitan, holding 24% of Class A shares. The company’s share structure will ensure that control remains with the founders — Mahdessian is chief executive and Kuzoyan president — who will retain all Class B shares, which are entitled to 10 votes each. Meritech Capital, in an analysis of the offering , said ServiceTitan appears to be eager to go public due to an unusual provision of its $365-million funding round in November 2022 when money was harder to come by. A so-called “IPO ratchet” protected participants by guaranteeing them more shares should the company’s IPO price decline below its funding-round valuation. PitchBook valued the company at $7.6 billion at the time, meaning the IPO needs to trade above a “base” of $84.57 per share or ServiceTitan will have to issue more shares, Meritech said. The base per share price also compounds after a certain time, making it more difficult for the IPO price to exceed it. “ServiceTitan is incentivized to get public ASAP,” Meritech stated in its report. Lead underwriters on the IPO are Goldman Sachs Group, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Citigroup. The offering is expected to be watched closely for signs that the IPO market is making a comeback.",

         "Ara Mahdessian and Vahe Kuzoyan had a simple plan after graduating from college: Write some software that could assist their dads with all the paperwork that comes with being a contractor. Two decades later, that idea has morphed into a Glendale company called ServiceTitan, which last year served some 8,000 plumbing, HVAC, janitorial and other firms with a soup-to-nuts software suite — and now plans to go public on Nasdaq under the ticker “TTAN.” The tech company, which has raised about $1.4 billion in funding since its 2007 founding, did not disclose in the Nov. 18 filing how many shares it plans to sell or how much capital it wants to raise. A spokesperson declined to comment. The initial public offering of stock marks a significant step for the company, which had filed confidential paperwork for an $18-billion offering in 2022, according to Business Insider, but didn’t move forward after the Federal Reserve sharply raised interest rates to combat inflation, freezing up the IPO market. ServiceTitan — which makes most of its money charging a subscription for its services — reported revenue of $614 million in the fiscal year that ended Jan. 31, up nearly a third from a year earlier; and a loss of $195 million, 28% less than in fiscal 2023. It had about $147 million in cash and equivalents on hand as of Jan. 31, 2024, and was carrying $175 million in long-term net debt. The company, which serves contractors nationwide, says it wants to expand the number of trades and markets it serves. It employed 2,870 workers as of July 31 at its Glendale headquarters and t offices elsewhere in the U.S. and internationally. ServiceTitan has developed a web-based software that can manage all aspects of a contractor’s business, including booking appointments, generating estimates, processing invoices as well as payroll and dispatching workers. Clients range in size from family-owned contractors to large national franchises. It estimates it receives about 1% of what its clients charge their own customers, which totaled $62 billion in the 12 months that ended July 31. Competitors include BuildOps , Housecall Pro, Jobber and other companies that charge subscriptions for their web-based business management software. The founders immigrated to the United States in the 1980s as children: Mahdessian, 39, from Iran and Kuzoyan, 41, from Armenia. Mahdessian’s father started a contracting business, and Kuzoyan’s, plumbing. Mahdessian went off to Stanford and Kuzoyan got into USC, with the pair meeting at an Armenian students event. After graduation, they started in 2007 building a simple program to track customer calls and marketing budgets, but their venture soon attracted other contractors. The duo scored a seed round of funding from Mucker Capital in 2014. ServiceTitan also has gone on to make acquisitions and raise more than $1 billion from Iconiq Growth , Bessemer Venture Partners, Battery Ventures and others. Iconiq is the largest institutional shareholder of ServiceTitan, holding 24% of Class A shares. The company’s share structure will ensure that control remains with the founders — Mahdessian is chief executive and Kuzoyan president — who will retain all Class B shares, which are entitled to 10 votes each. Meritech Capital, in an analysis of the offering , said ServiceTitan appears to be eager to go public due to an unusual provision of its $365-million funding round in November 2022 when money was harder to come by. A so-called “IPO ratchet” protected participants by guaranteeing them more shares should the company’s IPO price decline below its funding-round valuation. PitchBook valued the company at $7.6 billion at the time, meaning the IPO needs to trade above a “base” of $84.57 per share or ServiceTitan will have to issue more shares, Meritech said. The base per share price also compounds after a certain time, making it more difficult for the IPO price to exceed it. “ServiceTitan is incentivized to get public ASAP,” Meritech stated in its report. Lead underwriters on the IPO are Goldman Sachs Group, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Citigroup. The offering is expected to be watched closely for signs that the IPO market is making a comeback.",

         "Ara Mahdessian and Vahe Kuzoyan had a simple plan after graduating from college: Write some software that could assist their dads with all the paperwork that comes with being a contractor. Two decades later, that idea has morphed into a Glendale company called ServiceTitan, which last year served some 8,000 plumbing, HVAC, janitorial and other firms with a soup-to-nuts software suite — and now plans to go public on Nasdaq under the ticker “TTAN.” The tech company, which has raised about $1.4 billion in funding since its 2007 founding, did not disclose in the Nov. 18 filing how many shares it plans to sell or how much capital it wants to raise. A spokesperson declined to comment. The initial public offering of stock marks a significant step for the company, which had filed confidential paperwork for an $18-billion offering in 2022, according to Business Insider, but didn’t move forward after the Federal Reserve sharply raised interest rates to combat inflation, freezing up the IPO market. ServiceTitan — which makes most of its money charging a subscription for its services — reported revenue of $614 million in the fiscal year that ended Jan. 31, up nearly a third from a year earlier; and a loss of $195 million, 28% less than in fiscal 2023. It had about $147 million in cash and equivalents on hand as of Jan. 31, 2024, and was carrying $175 million in long-term net debt. The company, which serves contractors nationwide, says it wants to expand the number of trades and markets it serves. It employed 2,870 workers as of July 31 at its Glendale headquarters and t offices elsewhere in the U.S. and internationally. ServiceTitan has developed a web-based software that can manage all aspects of a contractor’s business, including booking appointments, generating estimates, processing invoices as well as payroll and dispatching workers. Clients range in size from family-owned contractors to large national franchises. It estimates it receives about 1% of what its clients charge their own customers, which totaled $62 billion in the 12 months that ended July 31. Competitors include BuildOps , Housecall Pro, Jobber and other companies that charge subscriptions for their web-based business management software. The founders immigrated to the United States in the 1980s as children: Mahdessian, 39, from Iran and Kuzoyan, 41, from Armenia. Mahdessian’s father started a contracting business, and Kuzoyan’s, plumbing. Mahdessian went off to Stanford and Kuzoyan got into USC, with the pair meeting at an Armenian students event. After graduation, they started in 2007 building a simple program to track customer calls and marketing budgets, but their venture soon attracted other contractors. The duo scored a seed round of funding from Mucker Capital in 2014. ServiceTitan also has gone on to make acquisitions and raise more than $1 billion from Iconiq Growth , Bessemer Venture Partners, Battery Ventures and others. Iconiq is the largest institutional shareholder of ServiceTitan, holding 24% of Class A shares. The company’s share structure will ensure that control remains with the founders — Mahdessian is chief executive and Kuzoyan president — who will retain all Class B shares, which are entitled to 10 votes each. Meritech Capital, in an analysis of the offering , said ServiceTitan appears to be eager to go public due to an unusual provision of its $365-million funding round in November 2022 when money was harder to come by. A so-called “IPO ratchet” protected participants by guaranteeing them more shares should the company’s IPO price decline below its funding-round valuation. PitchBook valued the company at $7.6 billion at the time, meaning the IPO needs to trade above a “base” of $84.57 per share or ServiceTitan will have to issue more shares, Meritech said. The base per share price also compounds after a certain time, making it more difficult for the IPO price to exceed it. “ServiceTitan is incentivized to get public ASAP,” Meritech stated in its report. Lead underwriters on the IPO are Goldman Sachs Group, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Citigroup. The offering is expected to be watched closely for signs that the IPO market is making a comeback.",

Welcome to the MongoDB third-quarter fiscal year 2025 conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there'll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your speaker for today, Brian Denyeau. Please go ahead. Brian Raferty Denyeau -- Investor Relations Thank you, Lisa. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today to review MongoDB's third-quarter fiscal 2025 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued after the close of the market today. Joining me the call today are Dev Ittycheria, president and CEO of MongoDB; and Michael Gordon, MongoDB's COO and CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our market and future growth opportunities, our expectations for the macroeconomic environment in fiscal 2025 and the impact of AI, the benefits of our product platform, our competitive landscape, customer behaviors, our financial guidance, and our planned investments in growth opportunities in AI. These statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including the results of operations and financial condition that cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. For a discussion of the material risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please refer to the risks described in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 31st, 2024 that we filed with the SEC on August 30th, 2024. Any forward-looking statements made on this call reflect our views only as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them except as required by law. Additionally, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures on this conference call. Please refer to the tables in our earnings release in the Investor Relations portion of our website for a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dev. Dev? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we had a strong quarter of new business and executed well against our large market opportunity. Let's begin by reviewing our third quarter results before giving you a broader company update. We generated revenue of $529 million, a 22% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew 26% year-over-year, representing 68% of total revenue. We generated non-GAAP operating income of $101 million for a 19% non-GAAP operating margin and we ended the quarter with over 52,600 customers. Overall, we were pleased with our performance in the third quarter. We had a strong new business quarter and we're happy with our new workload acquisition on Atlas. Our non-Atlas business significantly exceeded expectations in part because we benefited from a few large multi-year deals as customers continue to value our run anywhere strategy and want to build a deeper longer-term relationship with MongoDB. Atlas consumption was slightly better than expected in a macro-environment that we would characterize as largely consistent with what we saw in the first half of the year. Michael will cover consumption trends in more detail. Retention rates remained strong in Q3, demonstrating the mission criticality of our platform. On our Q1 earnings call, we shared with you the three major strategic initiatives that we believe will enable us to maximize our long-term opportunity. I want to give you an update on the progress we're making on those initiatives. First, we are increasing our investment in the enterprise channel since we see the strongest returns in this part of the market. Specifically, we're expanding our strategic account program going to next year, as we see more accounts that will benefit from incremental investment. In addition, we're investing time and resources to educate developers in large enterprise accounts and uplevel their MongoDB skills. These organizations have thousands of developers and as we penetrate them more deeply, we encounter developers who have historically only built SQL applications and simply do not know how to use MongoDB to its full potential. In our experience, educating these developers on the benefits of MongoDB drives significant incremental adoption of our platform. To fund these up-market investments, we are reallocating a portion of our mid-market investments. The mid-market remains an attractive opportunity for us, but we believe that prioritizing investment up-market will deliver strong returns in the current environment. We also believe there are additional ways to serve the mid-market more efficiently through our self-serve channel and other scaled technology-enabled sales and customer service motions. Second, we are optimistic about the opportunity to accelerate legacy app modernization using AI and are investing more in this area. As you recall, we ran a few successful pilots earlier this year, demonstrating that AI tooling combined with professional services and our relational migrator product can significantly reduce the time, cost, and risk of migrating legacy applications onto MongoDB. While it's early days, we have observed a more than 50% reduction in the cost to modernize. On the back of these strong early results, additional customer interest is exceeding our expectations. Large enterprises in every industry and geography are experiencing acute pain from their legacy infrastructure and are eager for more agile, performant, and cost-effective solutions. Not only are customers excited to engage with us, they also want to focus on some of the most important applications in their enterprise, further demonstrating the level of interest and size of the long-term opportunity. As relational applications encompass a wide variety of database types, programming languages, versions, and other customer-specific variables, we expect modernization projects to continue to include meaningful service engagements in the short and medium term. Consequently, we're increasing our professional services delivery capabilities, both directly and through partners. In the long run, we expect to automate and simplify large parts of the modernization process. To that end, we are leveraging the learnings from early service engagement to develop new tools to accelerate future modernization efforts. Although it's early days and scaling our legacy app modernization capabilities will take time, we have increased conviction that this motion will significantly add to our growth in the long term. Third, we are investing to capitalize on our inherent technical advantages as a key component of the emerging AI tech stack. As a reminder, MongoDB is uniquely equipped to query rich and complex data structures typical of AI applications. The ability of a database to query rich and complex data structures is crucial because AI applications often rely on highly detailed, interrelated, and nuanced data to make accurate predictions and decisions. For example, a recommendation system doesn't just analyze a single customer's purchase but also considers their browsing history, peer group behavior, and product categories requiring a database that can query and interlink these complex data structures. In addition, MongoDB's architecture unifies source data, metadata, operational data, and vector data in an all-in-one platform, updating the need for multiple database systems and complex back-end architectures. This enables a more compelling developer experience than any other alternative. From what we see in the AI market today, most customers are still in the experimental stage as they work to understand the effectiveness of the underlying tech stack and build early proof-of-concept applications. However, we are seeing an increasing number of AI apps in production. Today, we have thousands of AI apps on our platform. What we don't yet see is many of these apps actually achieving meaningful product market fit and therefore significant traction. In fact, as you take a step back and look at the entire universe of AI apps, a very small percentage of them have achieved the type of scale that we commonly see with enterprise-specific applications. We do have some AI apps that are growing quickly, including one that is already a seven-figure workload that has grown 10 times since the beginning of the year. Similar to prior platform shifts as the usefulness of AI tech improves and becomes more cost-effective, we will see the emergence of many more AI apps that do nail product market fit, but it's difficult to predict when that will happen more broadly. We remain confident that we will capture our fair share of these successful AI applications as we see that our platform is popular with developers building more sophisticated AI use cases. We continue investing in our product capabilities, including enterprise-grade Atlas Vector Search functionality to build on this momentum and even better position MongoDB to capture the AI opportunity. In addition, as previously announced, we are bringing search and vector service to our community and EA offerings, leveraging our run anywhere competitive advantage in the world of AI. Finally, we are expanding our MongoDB AI applications program or MAAP, which helps enterprise customers build and bring AI applications into production by providing them with reference architectures, integrations with leading tech providers, and coordinated services and support. Last week, we announced a new code of partners including McKinsey, Confluent, Capgemini, and Unstructured, as well as the collaboration with Meta to enable developers to build AI-enriched applications on MongoDB using Llama. Next, I'd like to provide you with a brief product update. At our dot local developer conference in London in October, we announced the general availability of MongoDB 8.0, the fastest and most performant version of MongoDB ever. MongoDB 8.0 performs 20% to 60% better against common industry benchmarks compared to our prior version and is built to exceed our customers' most stringent security, resiliency, availability, and performance requirements. To best serve our customers, we regularly review and reprioritize investments in our product portfolio to ensure we're allocating our resources to products with the highest demand from our customers. And to do that, we also deprecate products that are not showing results we desired. Consequently, we made the decision to consolidate our Atlas serverless offerings with our smallest dedicated tiers to create Atlas Flex customers, a new offering with a simpler architecture that provides the elasticity features akin to serverless. We will begin migrating effective customers to the single, simple, entry-level solution in Q4. We also decided to deprecate Atlas DeviceSync and other capabilities not widely adopted in order to focus our engineering resources on the core platform. While these reprioritization decisions are not made lightly, they allow us to deliver the most value to the largest number of customers, reinforcing our commitment to being the best modern database and helping us to grow faster. Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the adoption trends of MongoDB across our customer base. Customers across industries and around the world are running mission-critical projects in MongoDB Atlas, leveraging the full power of our developer data platform, including Financial Times, CarGurus, and Victoria's Secret. As part of the digital transformation journey, global specialty retailer Victoria's Secret & Company migrated its e-commerce platform to MongoDB Atlas. As a fully managed platform, MongoDB Atlas allowed the company to simplify its architecture and improve performance, supporting the retailer to provide a resilient, secure, and fast web and mobile e-commerce experience for their millions of customers around the world. Allianz, Alphamad, Swiss Post, and Paylocity are turning to MongoDB to modernize applications. Paylocity, a leading provider of cloud-based payroll and human capital management software, selected MongoDB to power proprietary application aimed at fostering employee connections and engagement. When traffic increased and the original SQL-based solution was unable to keep up with the required performance metrics, Paylocity migrated to MongoDB Atlas to take advantage of the flexible schema architecture, performance, and scalability. MongoDB costs five times less than the previous SQL database solution and the company's developers can now create an application within minutes, something that used to take weeks. Mature companies and start-ups alike are using MongoDB to help deliver the next wave of AI-powered application to customers, including NerdWallet, Cisco, and Tealbook. Tealbook, a supplier intelligence platform, migrated from Postgres, pgvector, and ElasticSearch to MongoDB to eliminate technical debt and consolidate their tech stack. The company experienced workload isolation and scalability issues in pgvector and were concerned with the search index inconsistencies, which were all resolved with the migration to MongoDB. With Atlas Vector search and dedicated search nodes, Tealbook has realized improved cost-efficiency and increased scalability for the supplier data platform, an application that uses GenAI to collect, verify, and enrich supplier data across various sources. In summary, we had a healthy Q3 with both Atlas and EA exceeding expectations. We saw a strong new business quarter and we remain confident in our ability to become an increasing strategic provider in our large and growing market. Looking forward, we see a great opportunity to grow our adoption in the enterprise through new workloads, modernizing legacy applications, and winning the next generation of AI-powered applications. I would like to finish by providing an update on our senior leadership. First, as we announced early in the press release, after nearly 10 years, Michael Gordon has made the decision to leave MongoDB. Michael has been instrumental in MongoDB's success over the past decade, leading our successful IPO, helping us grow our revenue nearly 50-fold, and scaling -- and successfully scaling our business model to generate meaningful operating leverage. He has been a trusted advisor and business partner to the Board and me over the years and also has become a personal friend. Michael is excited to take a well-deserved break. We have commenced the search for Michael's replacement and will be evaluating both internal and external candidates. One of Michael's proudest compliments -- accomplishments has been building a world-class finance team under his leadership, and I'm confident that we will not miss a beat during this transition. Michael will continue to serve as CFO through January 31st to help us finish the fiscal year and then will transition to an Advisor to the company to ensure a seamless process. If we have not named Michael's successor by fiscal year-end, Serge Tanjga, SVP of Finance, will serve as Interim CFO, beginning on February 1st. Second, we are promoting Cedric Pech, currently our chief revenue officer to the newly created role of president worldwide field operations. In this new position, Cedric will oversee all our field-based customer-facing and go-to-market enablement teams, including professional services. We believe this org structure will best enable us to execute on some of the key strategic initiatives I discussed earlier, in particular, our increased focus on up-market and the app monetization opportunity. I would like to congratulate Cedric on this well-deserved promotion. With that, let me turn the call over to Michael. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Dev, and thanks for the kind words and our incredible partnership over the past decade. The past 10 years have been the most rewarding in my professional career and I'm extremely proud of what we've achieved together and of course, to the whole MongoDB team. With as much success as we had, I still believe that MongoDB is in the early stages of realizing its full potential as it continues to take share in one of the largest markets in software. Now, turning to the results for the quarter. I'll begin with a detailed review of our third-quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025. First, I'll start with our third quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $529.4 million, up 22% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance. Shifting to our product mix, Atlas grew 26% in the quarter compared to the previous year and now represents 68% of total revenue compared to 66% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and 71% last quarter. We recognized Atlas revenue primarily based on customer consumption of our platform and that consumption is closely tied to end user activity of their applications. Let me provide some context on Atlas consumption in the quarter. In Q3, consumption was slightly ahead of our expectations. This year's Q3 seasonal improvement was more muted than in years past as expected. On a year-over-year basis, consumption growth remains below that of prior year period. Turning to non-Atlas revenue. Non-Atlas came in significantly ahead of our expectations. As Dev mentioned, EA new business was strong, and we continue to have success selling incremental workloads into our existing customer base. In addition, our Q3 non-Atlas revenue benefited from a few large multi-year deals. As you know, due to ASC 606, we recognized the entire term license component of a multi-year contract at the start of that contract. Compared to Q3 of last year, the multi-year license component of non-Atlas revenues was over $15 million higher. Turning to customer growth. During the third quarter, we grew our customer base by approximately 1,900 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 52,600, which is up from over 46,400 in the year-ago period. Of our total customer count, over 7,400 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 6,900 in the year-ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven primarily by Atlas, which had over 51,100 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 44,900 in the year-ago period. It is important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers adding their first Atlas workload. Continuing on, in Q3, our net ARR expansion rate was approximately 120%. We ended the quarter with 2,314 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, up from $1,972 in the year-ago period. Moving down the income statement, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the third quarter was $405.7 million, representing a gross margin of 77%, which is flat versus the year-ago period. Our income from operations was $101.5 million or 19% operating margin for the third quarter compared to an 18% operating margin in the year-ago period. The primary reason for more favorable operating income results versus guidance is our revenue outperformance, including the very high margin multi-year license revenue benefit. Net income in the third quarter was $98.1 million or $1.16 per share, based on 84.2 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a net income of $79.1 million or $0.96 per share on 83.7 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding in the year-ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the third quarter with $2.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $37.4 million. After taking into consideration approximately $2.9 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was $34.6 million in the quarter. This compares to free cash flow of $35 million in the year-ago period. In Q3, we did not incur capital expenditures to purchase IPV4 addresses as we previously expected, but we did start making those purchases in November and still expect a total outlay of $20 million to $25 million this fiscal year as we previously communicated. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $515 million to $519 million. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $55 million to $58 million and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.65 based on 84.9 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. For the full-fiscal year 2025, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.973 billion to $1.977 billion, non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $242 million to $245 million, and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $3.01 to $3.03 based on 84 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. Note that the non-GAAP net income per share guidance for the fourth-quarter and full-fiscal year 2025 includes a non-GAAP tax provision of approximately 20%. I'll now provide some more context around our updated guidance. First, in terms of Atlas consumption, we expect to see a typical seasonal slowdown in Q4, driven by underlying application usage moderating during the holiday season. Second, since Atlas consumption remained lower on a year-over-year basis in Q3, we expect to see continued deceleration of Atlas year-over-year growth in Q4. Third, we expect to see a sequential decline in non-Atlas revenue in Q4, which is contrary to our normal pattern. The reason for this is that we experienced a significant additional benefit from multi-year deals in Q3, which we do not expect to recur in Q4. In addition, I want to provide some incremental color on some of our recent product and -- how some of our recent product and go-to-market changes will impact the growth of our reported customer count going forward. First, as Dev explained, we are reallocating a portion of our go-to-market resources from the mid-market to the enterprise channel. As a result, we expect to see significantly fewer mid-market direct sales customer net additions and as a result, slower direct sales customer growth going forward. We believe this reallocation of investment dollars will drive higher revenue growth over time. So, it's a trade-off that makes sense. Second, as we introduce Atlas Flex clusters in Q4 and automatically migrate customers in Q1, we expect to see a one-time negative impact to our customer count since we have approximately 4,000 serverless customers who are very low spending and we do not expect them to transition over to Flex. These customers have a negligible impact on our revenue but will impact our reported customer count. To summarize, we're pleased with our third quarter results and especially our ability to win new business. We have a small share in one of the largest and fastest-growing markets in all of software with a number of secular tailwinds, including AI at our back. We'll continue investing judiciously and focusing on our execution to capture this long-term opportunity. With that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator? Questions & Answers: Operator [Operator instructions] Our first question for the day will be coming from Sanjit Singh of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Thank you for taking the questions and congrats, Michael, on outstanding career. You had an absolutely fantastic run at MongoDB. I'm excited to see what you do next, or excited if you just take a breather. So congrats, Michael. I guess to take the question -- to start off with the questions, when we look at what Atlas has been doing in the past two quarters, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think consumption is coming in at least modestly ahead of your expectations. Relative to what we've seen at the beginning of the year, what sort of -- is it a function of sales execution? Is it a function of the end-user activity sort of improving? What's driving at least the improvement in Atlas consumption in the past two quarters? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So a few different things. So I think if you look at our outlook at the beginning of the year, we had indicated that we thought we would see stable Atlas growth from a consumption standpoint. What we've seen and what we've talked about is -- we've actually seen lower year-over-year growth based on the underlying consumption. And so -- and that's incorporated into our Q4 guide. We have seen the Q3 and Q4 be -- sorry, Q2 and Q3, excuse me, be better than our expectations, but it's still down on a year-over-year basis. And so I want to make sure that we're not sort of confusing the comparative set of year-over-year versus relative to our expectations. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Understood. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer And the core of it, Sanjit, to your question is really the underlying usage of the applications. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Yeah, that makes total sense. And then, Dev, I have to ask you the AI agent question. In terms of an AI agent needing more context, it has going to have a set of tools to take its actions. What does it mean for MongoDB as an operational data store as customers start to roll out more agentic applications? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, just to talk about agents, I think when you think about agents, there's jobs, there's -- sorry, there's a job, there's projects and then there's task. Right now, the agents that are being rolled out are really focused on task like say something from Sierra or some other companies are rolling out agents. But you're right, what they deemed to do is to deal with being able to create a rich and complex data structures. Now why is this important for AI is that AI models don't just look at isolated data points, but they need to understand relationships, hierarchies, and patterns within the data. They need to be able to essentially get real-time insights. For example, if you have a chatbot where someone is querying, a customer is kind of trying to get some update on the order they placed five minutes ago because they may have not gotten any confirmation, your chatbot needs to be able to deal with real-time information. You need to be able to deal with basically handling very advanced use cases, understanding like, to do things like fraud detection to understand behaviors of supply chains, you need to understand intricate data relationships. All these things are consistent with MongoDB offers. And so we believe that at the end of the day, we are well-positioned to handle this. And the other thing that I would say is that we've embedded in a very natural way of search and vector search. So we're just not an OLTP database, we do tech search and vector search. That's all one experience and no other platform offers that, and we think we have a real advantage. And so we're integrated with the leading AI frameworks and platforms. We have enterprise-grade security and compliance, and customers can run us anywhere, either on 118 cloud regions or on-prem, and that again is a huge differentiator for us. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Awesome. Appreciate the thoughts, Dev. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Sanjit. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Taylor -- Tyler Radke of Citi. Your line is open. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Hi, thank you very much for taking the question. And, Michael, all the best, and congratulations on 10 years. Going back to the sales execution, I mean, one of the things that you talked about earlier this year was some challenges just in terms of the recently acquired workloads ramping. And I think a lot of those were from the past fiscal year. So curious how the quality of workload acquisition has trended this year. And as you think about the ramp in consumption potential into next year, how does that sort of look versus this time a year ago? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Maybe I'll just talk about what we're doing and the changes we made and then Michael can talk a little bit about the consumption trends. So, we did make some changes at the beginning of the year, and we really wanted to focus on both the volume and the quality of the workloads and there were some slight adjustments that we made. We think those changes are having a reasonable positive impact. Again, it's too early to declare victory because these workloads usually start small and grow over time, but we're really pleased with the results we're seeing so far. And -- but again, it's early days. And obviously, we'll know about the fiscal '25 workloads as we go into fiscal '26. But so far, so good. Michael, on consumption? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, just a couple of things, and thanks, Tyler. The fiscal '24 cohorts that we called out earlier, that slower growth does continue. They've been in line with our revised expectations. We made some changes that we talked about at the -- earlier in the year that should affect the fiscal '25 cohorts, but it's just too early to tell. On those, we need a few more quarters of data before you can really see if we're -- how we're seeing those behave differently. I will say we've talked about the new business environment and our success in new business. We have been pleased with that, but that just shows kind of the initial piece, and we need to see how they grow and how those cohorts evolve. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Great. Thanks. And follow-up on the EA side, you talked about the outsized strength in non-Atlas business this quarter. Maybe if you could unpack like the relative upside that was driven by simply duration versus new business. I know you called out the duration impact year-over-year, but are -- do you feel like this was sort of a one-off or do you feel like maybe some of your bigger customers are indexing more toward EA and how does that impact the way you think about the product and introducing things like vector search and stream processing onto the on-prem product? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, thank you. So overall, we continue to find the EA product resonate with customers. It's an important part of the run anywhere strategy and we've continued to see success with that and people wanting to increase their investment in MongoDB. There's always been a multiyear component and we continue to see that. We talked about that at the beginning of the year as to how fiscal '24 had an abnormally high amount of multi-year benefit and therefore, we were anticipating that being a headwind and we quantified that in roughly the $40 million range. What we talked about on this call earlier is we saw from a few large accounts, a surprising amount of multiyear that positively benefited Q3 at a little more than $15 million in revenue compared to what we saw Q3 a year ago. So, not as much of a headwind as we had been expecting. Obviously, with the 606 dynamics, some of these things, especially for a large deal can be kind of meaty and chunky and lumpy, which is why we try and call it out and sort of help people understand, but there's a pretty healthy kind of baseline flow, not just of EA, but also of multiyear. And when we see spikes, we just try and call it out for you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I just want to add, Tyler, that we are investing in our what we call our EA business. First, we're starting by investing with search and vector search and a community product. That does a couple of things for us. One, whenever anyone starts with MongoDB with the open-source product, they immediately get all the benefits of that complete highly integrated platform. Two, those capabilities will then migrate to EA. So, EA for us is an investment strategy. We definitely see lots of large customers who are very, very committed to running workloads on-prem. We even see some customers want to run to run AI workloads on-prem. So, the optionality they get by using MongoDB to not just be on-prem and the cloud, but also cross-cloud is a very compelling one. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Brad Reback of Stifel. Your line is open. Brad Reback -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. And, Michael, best of luck. It's been a great run. Dev, you started the call talking about a bunch of investments, which are great given the growth of the business. And obviously, you talked about reallocating some expenses. But net-net, should we think about this incremental investment phase next year as gating margin upside? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think that's something that we obviously are not ready to talk about next year just now, but I would say that we -- the reason we're looking to invest and just to summarize again, going up-market on legacy app modernization where we see very large workloads potentially at play and being the ideal database for GenAI apps, which is the future as important investments to drive long-term growth. And we're quite energized by those investments and that's something that we have high conviction on. Brad Reback -- Analyst That's great. And then on the MAAP program, are most of those workloads going to wind up in Atlas or will that be a healthy combination of EA and Atlas? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think it's again early days. I would say -- I would probably say more on the side of Atlas and EA in the early days. I think once we introduce a search and vector search into the EA product, you'll see more of that on-prem. Obviously, people can use MongoDB for AI workloads using other technologies as well in conjunction with MongoDB for on-prem AI use cases. But I would say you're probably going to see that happen first in Atlas. Brad Reback -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Jason Ader of William Blair. Your line is open. Jason Ader -- Analyst Yeah, thank you. I'm not going to belabor congratulating Michael, but it has been it has been fun working with you and best of luck. The question I had is on the strength in EA. Do you think, Dev, it represents a comment on how enterprises might be rethinking or reassessing the kind of on-prem versus cloud workload placement decision? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Well, when I think about large enterprises, I think large enterprises have meaningful workloads that are still running on-prem. I think the belief that everything would go to the cloud was probably something that was really popular in the good old days of Zurp. But I think now as customers assess their investments that they already have in place, they're being much more judicious about where they run those workloads and if they think they can leverage their existing investments in their own infrastructure, then they're going to do so. Also for a bunch of other reasons like regulatory reasons, some customers are quite not moving as aggressively to the cloud. We see that in particularly in Europe, where we see a lot of the European banks still running majority of the workloads on-prem. So it also varies by region where conversely in Asia, we're seeing people much move much more aggressively to the cloud. So I think it really depends on industry, on geography, and on the personal dynamics of what's happening in that particular account. I mean, we see some large US banks are also very committed to running things on-prem. So it really varies. And that's why we feel really good about our run anywhere strategy because it gives customer optionality. They can build something and run on-prem. And if and when they choose to move to the cloud, it's very easy to do so with MongoDB. Jason Ader -- Analyst All right. And then just as a follow-up also on the investments you're making in strategic sales and enterprise. Could you just get a little more specific on what those investments might be? Is it hiring a lot of new salespeople? Is it working more with SIs, investing more in SIs? Any additional detail would be helpful. Thanks. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So just for everyone's benefit, we've identified a number of accounts, which we call strategic accounts, which we think that have high upside for us. We've seen a number of accounts that grow very quickly when we deploy the right mix of resources. Now they're all not necessarily quota-carrying resources. They could be additional technical sales resources, additional PS resources, additional customer service resources to better service and support those accounts. We even do things like run education sessions for developers of the accounts, they're called either hackathons or like what we call developer days or even design reviews where we'll meet with our development teams who are looking to build an application, help them think about how they would potentially use MongoDB to build that particular app. And what we find is that because many of these developers, the experience with MongoDB is quite limited, the more we can engage with them, the more we can educate them and the more we can show them how simple and easy it is. Like for example, most customers today think like they have to use an OLTP database, then a search database, maybe a vector database, and then like a caching database. And all that is integrated in MongoDB. So all of a sudden, customers can say, wow, I can simplify my life, simplify my back-end infrastructure, build this app far more quickly and it will be much more easier to manage long-term if I do everything on MongoDB. And it's really a function of just educating them on the power of MongoDB that really opens up a lot of opportunities for us. So that's why we're doubling down, and the mix of resources is really predicated on the accounts, but it's not just quota counting resources, it's the whole suite of resources that we're bringing to the table. Jason Ader -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Andrew Nowinski of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Okay. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking the question and congrats on a nice quarter. You gave an example of a customer that migrated off Postgres and I think you said they had issues with their PG vector function. I was wondering how long was that customer using Postgres before they decided to make a change to Mongo, meaning was this some sort of like a rebound type customer where they chose PG -- or excuse me, Postgres and it didn't work? And then how frequently are you seeing this type of transition? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So I can't give you the specifics on how long they were using Postgres, but this is not -- this is a trend that we're seeing in our business. You have to remember Postgres is a 40-year-old technology. It's -- and they have been the beneficiary of people lifting and shifting from other types of relational databases, Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, et cetera. And they're an open-source database. And but as part -- because they're an open-source and relational database, they have the same inherent challenges all relational databases do. They're quite inflexible. So once you build a schema, it's very hard to change the schema. It's hard to scale and hard to distribute data. And if you have large data volumes, you have to do weird things like, for example, resort to off-road storage for large data objects, which creates performance bottlenecks. And so again, people default to Postgres if they don't know anything better because all they know is relational and everyone is kind of moving off those other relational platforms. And that's the whole point I was saying earlier. Once we educate developers on the flexibility of schema, how easily or horizontally scale the rich query language where you can do aggregations and do sophisticated geospatial indexes, the productivity gains by using the document model and how easy is to organize data, it's -- people are just like, wow, life is so much easier. Now I want to be clear, this is not a zero-sum game. Postgres does not have to fail for us to be successful. It's a big market and we're quite excited about the opportunity, but we do see customers moving off Postgres and coming to MongoDB. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Thank you. That was very helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up. If we normalize the $15 million multiyear deal impact you had in Q3, would EA still be down sequentially in Q4? Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer We haven't given that level of guidance, but just trying to help you understand in the context of the full-year numbers and the headwind that we talked about at the beginning of the year, just given the strength that we saw in Q3. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Got it. Thanks. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. The next question will be coming from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst Hey, thank you. And if you think about the EA strength this quarter, Michael, you'd kind of give us a little bit there. Like how should we think about renewal -- the renewal situation renewal pool coming up like or that you had in Q3, coming up in Q4, et cetera, as well and then like what does it mean in terms of upsell, cross-sell opportunity as people think about starting AI projects by self-serve, as you kind of mentioned earlier on the call? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So I think about -- if you think about EA for Q4, it tends to be a large renewal quarter, but what we're talking about in terms of the guide is because we had such strength in multiyear, that's where we would expect to see our EA down sequentially, which is not typically our pattern, which is why we called it out. In terms of AI workloads and some of those other things, I think it's early to tell and obviously, we'll continue to evolve and assess our view when we get to the full-year guide in March. And then we'll also have an updated view on how the cohorts are behaving and sort of how multiyear played out. But I think in terms of Q4, the comments that I made earlier hopefully will help. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst Yeah. Okay, perfect. And then the -- and can you talk a little bit about like obviously, there's a debate of like which database will be the persistent layer if you do AI projects, et cetera. What do you see from the big hyperscalers in terms of working with you guys and partnerships? We obviously just have AWS kind of summit, et-cetera. Can you speak a little bit like how your relationship with those big guys is evolving around this? And Michael, All the best in case I don't talk to you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, I'll start with the partnerships first, like our -- with AWS, as you said, they just had their re:Invent show last week. Our -- it remains very, very strong. We've closed a ton of deals this past quarter. Some of them very, very large deals. We're doing integrations to some of the new products like Q and Bedrock and the engagement in the field has been really strong. On Azure, I think we -- as I've shared in the past, we start-off with a little bit of a slow start, but in the words of the person who runs their partner leadership, the Azure MongoDB relationship has never been stronger. We've closed a large number of deals. We're part of what's called the Azure native IC service program and have a bunch of deep integrations with Azure, including Fabric, Power BI, Visual Studio, Semantic Kernel, and Azure OpenAI Studio. And we're also one of Azure's largest marketplace partners. And GCP does -- we have actually seen some uptick in terms of co-sales that we've done this past quarter and GCP made some comp changes where they -- that were favorable to working with MongoDB that we saw some results in the field, and we're focused on closing on -- closing a handful of large deals with GCP in Q4. So in general, I would say, things are going quite well. And then in terms of, I guess, implying your question was like the hyperscalers and are they potentially bundling things along with their AI offerings? I mean, candidly, since day one, the hyperscalers have been bundling their database offerings with every offering that they have and that's been their predominant strategy. And we've -- I think we've executed well against strategy because databases are not like a by-the-way decision. It's an important decision. And I think the hyperscalers are seeing our performance and realize it's better to partner with us. And as I said, customers understand the importance of the data layer, especially for AI applications. And so the partnership across all three hyperscalers is strong. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst OK, perfect. Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Raimo. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. The next question will be coming from the line of Brad Sills of Bank of America. Your line is open. Brad Sills -- Analyst Great. Thank you so much, and congratulations, Michael, on your next move. I wanted to ask about new workloads here on vector search, stream processing, relational migrator. Is there any one of those three that's ramping faster than maybe you expected? Just a little bit of color on how those new workload types are ramping. Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I'll kind of give you just a rundown of some of the -- I mean, essentially you're asking about the new products, like our -- on search, we introduced a new capability called Atlas search nodes, which where you can asymmetrically scale your search nodes because if you have a search-intensive use case, you don't have to scale all your nodes because they have become quite expensive. And we've seen that this kind of groundbreaking capability really well received. The demand is quite high and because customers like they can tune the configuration to the unique needs of their search requirements. One of the world's largest banks is using Atlas Search to provide like a Google-like search experience on payments data for massive corporate customers. So this is a customer-facing application and so performance, and scalability are critical. A leading provider of AI-powered accounting software uses Atlas Search to power its invoice analytics future, which allows end users and finance teams to perform ad-hoc analysis and easily find past-due invoices and voices that contain errors. So that search -- on vector search, it -- again, and it's been our kind of our first full-year since going generally available. And the product uptake has been actually very, very high. In Q3, we released quantization for Atlas Vector Search, which reduces the memory requirements by up to 96%, allowing us to support larger vector workloads with vastly improved price performance. For example, a multinational news organization created a GenAI powered tool designed to help producers and journalists efficiently search, summarize, and verify information from vast and varied data sources. A leading security firm is using Atlas Vector Search to fight AI fraud and a leading global media company replaced elastic search with hybrid search and vector search use case for a user recommendation engine that's built to suggest -- that's built in to suggest articles to end users. And so that's super exciting to see as well. We're also seeing a lot of interest in our streaming product, demand is very high. We just rolled it out to another hyperscaler, and customers are commenting on that the use cases of being able to embed stream processing with MongoDB makes our life so much easier. So overall, we're quite pleased with the progress we're making on the new products. And as I said before, natively bundling all these capabilities really reduces or eliminates the need for customers to have to bolt on a bunch of different technologies to solve the same problem, saving them a lot of time, money, cost, and risk. Brad Sills -- Analyst That's really exciting. Thanks, Dev. And then I wanted to ask a question around Cedric's appointment. Any focus that may be different here under his leadership that we should be thinking about going forward? Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer No, Cedric has been our CRO for, gosh, now like I think like five, six years, and he -- I was the Interim CRO for about three quarters until he took over when we last made a change and this is really an expansion of his responsibilities. I've known Cedric for a long time. He and I have worked with at multiple different companies. I think I have a good barometer for understanding sales leadership. There's a number of sales leaders who worked at other top-tier software companies who used to work for me or with me. And so I'm super-excited by the role Cedric is going to take and then we're also making some changes under Cedric to better align the different organizations so that we can more tightly work together on going up-market, on app monetization and positioning ourselves well to be the ideal database for GenAI apps. Brad Sills -- Analyst Super exciting. Thanks, Dev. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Brad. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question, please. Our next question will be coming from the line of Mike Cikos of Needham and Company. Your line is open. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Hey guys, thanks for taking the question here. I just wanted to come back to the consumption growth being slightly better than expectations again for the second quarter in a row now. And apologies if I missed it, but this improvement that we're seeing, is this across all vintages and geographies or is it potentially more concentrated in scope? Just trying to get a better understanding of what's seeking place out there and what's embedded in the guide. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. No, I would describe it as broad-based, Mike. And obviously, we're pleased to see it and we're continuing monitoring and slicing and dicing it in different ways. And as we have information or insights to you, we'll share it. And without trying to throw a whole bunch of cold water on our mind, it was slightly better, or a step-function changed better, but good to see. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Terrific. And maybe for a quick follow-up for Dev. I think it builds off maybe Tyler's question at the top of the Q&A, but you had cited that some customers are thinking about their workloads more holistically and even looking to run AI workloads on-prem. How much of that do you think is just a function of customers are still trying to figure out how to optimize for latency and cost or is this more a demonstration of we really are in the early phases of the exploratory phase versus going into production? Is there any way to coarse that out or is the two not necessarily connected? Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer No, I think it's kind of a little bit of both. I think you have some customers who are very committed to running a big part of the estate on-prem. So by definition, then if they're going to build an AI workload, it has to be run on-prem, which means that they also need access to GPUs and they're doing that. And then other customers are leveraging basically renting GPUs from the cloud providers and building their own AI workloads. I do think we're in the very, very early days. They're still learning, experimenting. More-and-more apps are entering production. And as I said on the prepared remarks, we have thousands of workload -- AI workloads running on MongoDB, but a very small percentage of them have demonstrated meaningful product market fit. And so the initial traction is kind of still small. But I think as people get more sophisticated with AI, as the AI technology matures and becomes more and more useful, I think applications will -- you'll start seeing these applications take-off. I kind of chuckled that today I see more senior leaders bragging about the chips they're using versus the apps they're building. So it just tells you that we're still in the very, very early days of this big platform shift. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Great point. Thank you again, guys. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Mike. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Eric Heath of KeyBanc. Your line is open. Eric Heath -- Analyst Hi, thanks for taking the question. Dev, Michael, it sounds like the takeaway from the call is a greater focus on EA and on enterprise. So should we structurally rethink the EA business differently and think of this more as a healthy double-digit growth business going forward for the foreseeable future? And then if I could just ask a follow-up question separate to that. But Michael, I understand that it's still early to identify the fiscal '25 cohort of workloads, but just curious at a high-level if they look and feel like of higher quality than the fiscal '24 cohort of workflow. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Do you want to take on the first one in terms of EA... Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, I mean, I would say, I mean, we are very committed to our run anywhere strategy. And as I said, we are first investing in community where for many customers is the first way they experience MongoDB. And we want them to have the full experience of integrating search and Vector search into our core product. And so they can out of the gate really start building applications. That will then transition to building those capabilities into EA. So, we are clearly investing in the EA product. But Atlas is still a big, big part of our business and a big, big part of our growth engine and we typically launch new features on Atlas and because of the capabilities we already have, the fact it's multi-cloud makes it a very, very compelling offering for many customers. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. And I think in terms of the workloads, I do think it's early. Just as a reminder for folks, they tend to start small, although grow quickly. I think the only other thing that I can add is, we've been pretty consistent and that we've been pleased with the new business that we've done. But we need some time to let the cohorts play out as we track them. But I think like I said, we've been happy with the new business that we were winning. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of William Power of Baird. Your line is open. Brian Raferty Denyeau -- Investor Relations You there, William? William Power -- Analyst Sorry, yeah. Thank you. Dev, you had some encouraging comments on relational migrator. I wonder if you could just touch on what you think is driving the higher interest here. I mean, it sounds like AI is contributing and helping, but it'd be great to get some more color there because that still feels like obviously a meaningful long-term opportunity. And then maybe the second part of the question for Dev or Michael, just be great to get any other framework around the professional services investments. Any way to kind of think about quantification and timing of that? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So the reason we're so excited about the opportunity to go after legacy applications is that, one, it seems like there's a confluence of events happening. One is that the increasing cost and tax of supporting and managing these legacy apps are just going up enough. Second, for many customers who are in regulated industries, the regulators are calling their -- the fact that they're running on these legacy apps with systemic risk, so they can no longer kick the can down the road. Third, also because they no longer can kick the can around, some vendors are going end-of-life, so they have to make a decision to migrate those applications to a more modern tech stack. Fourth, because GenAI is so predicated on data and to build a competitive advantage, you need to leverage your proprietary data, people want to access that data and be able to do so easily. And so that's another reason for them to want to modernize. And then you also have people who built those applications who are retiring or just no longer in the firm, so it just creates more and more risk for the companies. Given all that, customers are incredibly interested in figuring out a way to easily and safely and securely migrate those -- off those applications. And we always could help them very easily move the data and map the schema from a relational schema to a document schema. The hardest part was essentially rewriting the application. Now with the advent of GenAI, you can now significantly reduce the time. One, you can use GenAI to analyze existing code. Two, you can use GenAI to reverse engineer tests to test what the code does. And then three, you can use GenAI to build new code and then users test it to ensure that the new code produces the same results as the old code. And so all that time and effort is suddenly cut in a meaningful way and that's suddenly creating a lot of interest from customers saying, my goodness. And if you're already on a relational app, moving to another relational app doesn't feel like modernization. So, the other advantage is that moving to MongoDB gives them a much more modern platform, a much more agile, flexible, performant, and scalable platform for their future needs. And that's why we're so excited. Again, it's early days. We've run a number of pilots that have gone well. We're in the process of working with some customers now in the migration process. This will take time because these are very, very complex applications. And actually, one thing I also mentioned was that they're not just going after -- saying go after some tertiary Tier 2 or Tier 3 application, they're saying, hey, we want you to look at some of our crown jewels because these are the apps that are most painful for us. So that's also very exciting. But again, this will take time, but we're very committed to this, and we think this is going to drive -- help us drive long-term -- meaningful long-term growth. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, Will. And to the last part of your question on the professional services investment, we're really building out that capacity in order to meet the demand that we're seeing relative to the opportunity. We're calling it in particular because it has a gross margin impact because that's where that will typically show up. And then maybe the last thing and it's probably obvious, but just to sort of underscore it is the reason we're doing this though is for the ARR, right, to drive the new workloads, the additional workloads over to MongoDB as part of that migration. And over time, as we've talked about before, we hope and expect to be able to leverage technology more and more, but at least initially and into the medium-term, there's going to be a healthy human/services component to that. Just wanted to sort of effectively telegraph that out to folks. William Power -- Analyst That's helpful. Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Will. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Rudy Kessinger of DA Davidson. Please go ahead. Rudy Kessinger -- Analyst Hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in here. I believe last quarter you said consumption growth slightly ahead of expectations. And while down slower year-over-year growth versus Q2 last year, the year-over-year growth did improve from Q1. And so, I guess I'm curious for Q3, could you make a comment in that same regard? Obviously, slower on a year-over-year basis than Q3 last year, but was it stable with year-over-year consumption growth in Q2 or better or worse? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Rudy, thanks for the question. We haven't specifically called that out relative to Q2. We did see a lower year-over-year growth as we called out. We did see a seasonal rebound. Usually Q3 is stronger than Q2 and we talked about how that was smaller than in the prior year. So hopefully, that will help you all triangulate. Rudy Kessinger -- Analyst Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. I believe it was on your Q4 call back in March. At that point, Dev, you said it would be at least another year until AI applications are being deployed at scale. It sounds like the commentary that some early large workloads, but out of the thousands, just not many that are at large scale. I guess, is your expectation now that maybe it's still at least another year until we're seeing broad AI application rollouts at scale? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I think a lot of it's a function of the what's happening in the R&D side of AI, right? So for example, today, we don't have a very compelling model designed for our phones, right, because today the phones don't have the computing horsepower to run complex models. So, you don't see a ton of very, very successful consumer apps besides, say, ChatGPT or Claude. So we don't -- we also don't see like hundreds of apps taking off like you saw kind of the first generation of like the Internet or the cloud era, right, or the mobile era. So like I think we're still in the early days of AI. And so while we see a lot of people building AI apps, a lot of them have kind of fairly rudimentary functionality. But I think that over time that's going to change. In fact, I know it will change. I just can't predict when that will happen. But where we do see apps having production, we are having traction, we're seeing them grow very, very quickly and we have a lot of them on our platform. It's just very few of them are really have meaningful. Operator Thank you. And that concludes today's Q&A session. I would like to go ahead and turn the call back over to Dev for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, everyone. I just wanted to say we're really pleased with our Q3 results with strong new business performance and revenue exceeding expectations both -- across both Atlas and EA. We're making the necessary investments to expand our enterprise channel where we see the largest opportunity to establish MongoDB as a standard and the strongest returns on our go-to-market investments. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the progress we're making on both accelerating legacy app modernization with AI as well as establishing ourselves as a standard of the emerging AI tech stack for greenfield AI applications. And last but not least, I would like to thank Michael again for his contributions over the past 10 years and wish him well. Thank you, everyone, and we'll talk to you soon.

let's begin reviewing third quarter result giving broader company update. generated revenue $529 million, 22% year-over-year increase high end guidance. atlas revenue grew 26% year-over-year, representing 68% total revenue. generated non-gaap operating income $101 million 19% non-gaap operating margin ended quarter 52,600 customers. overall, pleased performance third quarter. strong new business quarter happy new workload acquisition atlas. non-atlas business significantly exceeded expectation part benefited large multi-year deal customer continue value run anywhere strategy want build deeper longer-term relationship mongodb. atlas consumption slightly better expected macro-environment would characterize largely consistent saw first half year. michael cover consumption trend detail. retention rate remained strong q3, demonstrating mission criticality platform. q1 earnings call, shared three major strategic initiative believe enable u maximize long-term opportunity. want give update progress making initiatives. first, increasing investment enterprise channel since see strongest return part market. specifically, expanding strategic account program going next year, see account benefit incremental investment. addition, investing time resource educate developer large enterprise account uplevel mongodb skills. organization thousand developer penetrate deeply, encounter developer historically built sql application simply know use mongodb full potential. experience, educating developer benefit mongodb drive significant incremental adoption platform. fund up-market investments, reallocating portion mid-market investments. mid-market remains attractive opportunity us, believe prioritizing investment up-market deliver strong return current environment. also believe additional way serve mid-market efficiently self-serve channel scaled technology-enabled sale customer service motions. second, optimistic opportunity accelerate legacy app modernization using ai investing area. recall, ran successful pilot earlier year, demonstrating ai tooling combined professional service relational migrator product significantly reduce time, cost, risk migrating legacy application onto mongodb. early days, observed 50% reduction cost modernize. back strong early results, additional customer interest exceeding expectations. large enterprise every industry geography experiencing acute pain legacy infrastructure eager agile, performant, cost-effective solutions. customer excited engage us, also want focus important application enterprise, demonstrating level interest size long-term opportunity. relational application encompass wide variety database types, programming languages, versions, customer-specific variables, expect modernization project continue include meaningful service engagement short medium term. consequently, increasing professional service delivery capabilities, directly partners. long run, expect automate simplify large part modernization process. end, leveraging learning early service engagement develop new tool accelerate future modernization efforts. although early day scaling legacy app modernization capability take time, increased conviction motion significantly add growth long term. third, investing capitalize inherent technical advantage key component emerging ai tech stack. reminder, mongodb uniquely equipped query rich complex data structure typical ai applications. ability database query rich complex data structure crucial ai application often rely highly detailed, interrelated, nuanced data make accurate prediction decisions. example, recommendation system analyze single customer's purchase also considers browsing history, peer group behavior, product category requiring database query interlink complex data structures. addition, mongodb's architecture unifies source data, metadata, operational data, vector data all-in-one platform, updating need multiple database system complex back-end architectures. enables compelling developer experience alternative. see ai market today, customer still experimental stage work understand effectiveness underlying tech stack build early proof-of-concept applications. however, seeing increasing number ai apps production. today, thousand ai apps platform. yet see many apps actually achieving meaningful product market fit therefore significant traction. fact, take step back look entire universe ai apps, small percentage achieved type scale commonly see enterprise-specific applications. ai apps growing quickly, including one already seven-figure workload grown 10 time since beginning year. similar prior platform shift usefulness ai tech improves becomes cost-effective, see emergence many ai apps nail product market fit, difficult predict happen broadly. remain confident capture fair share successful ai application see platform popular developer building sophisticated ai use cases. continue investing product capabilities, including enterprise-grade atlas vector search functionality build momentum even better position mongodb capture ai opportunity. addition, previously announced, bringing search vector service community ea offerings, leveraging run anywhere competitive advantage world ai. finally, expanding mongodb ai application program maap, help enterprise customer build bring ai application production providing reference architectures, integration leading tech providers, coordinated service support. last week, announced new code partner including mckinsey, confluent, capgemini, unstructured, well collaboration meta enable developer build ai-enriched application mongodb using llama. next, like provide brief product update. dot local developer conference london october, announced general availability mongodb 8.0, fastest performant version mongodb ever. mongodb 8.0 performs 20% 60% better common industry benchmark compared prior version built exceed customers' stringent security, resiliency, availability, performance requirements. best serve customers, regularly review reprioritize investment product portfolio ensure allocating resource product highest demand customers. that, also deprecate product showing result desired. consequently, made decision consolidate atlas serverless offering smallest dedicated tier create atlas flex customers, new offering simpler architecture provides elasticity feature akin serverless. begin migrating effective customer single, simple, entry-level solution q4. also decided deprecate atlas devicesync capability widely adopted order focus engineering resource core platform. reprioritization decision made lightly, allow u deliver value largest number customers, reinforcing commitment best modern database helping u grow faster. now, like spend minute reviewing adoption trend mongodb across customer base. customer across industry around world running mission-critical project mongodb atlas, leveraging full power developer data platform, including financial times, cargurus, victoria's secret. part digital transformation journey, global specialty retailer victoria's secret & company migrated e-commerce platform mongodb atlas. fully managed platform, mongodb atlas allowed company simplify architecture improve performance, supporting retailer provide resilient, secure, fast web mobile e-commerce experience million customer around world. allianz, alphamad, swiss post, paylocity turning mongodb modernize applications. paylocity, leading provider cloud-based payroll human capital management software, selected mongodb power proprietary application aimed fostering employee connection engagement. traffic increased original sql-based solution unable keep required performance metrics, paylocity migrated mongodb atlas take advantage flexible schema architecture, performance, scalability. mongodb cost five time less previous sql database solution company's developer create application within minutes, something used take weeks. mature company start-ups alike using mongodb help deliver next wave ai-powered application customers, including nerdwallet, cisco, tealbook. tealbook, supplier intelligence platform, migrated postgres, pgvector, elasticsearch mongodb eliminate technical debt consolidate tech stack. company experienced workload isolation scalability issue pgvector concerned search index inconsistencies, resolved migration mongodb. atlas vector search dedicated search nodes, tealbook realized improved cost-efficiency increased

promoting cedric pech, currently chief revenue officer newly created role president worldwide field operations. new position, cedric oversee field-based customer-facing go-to-market enablement teams, including professional services. believe org structure best enable u execute key strategic initiative discussed earlier, particular, increased focus up-market app monetization opportunity. would like congratulate cedric well-deserved promotion. that, let turn call michael. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer thanks, dev, thanks kind word incredible partnership past decade. past 10 year rewarding professional career extremely proud achieved together course, whole mongodb team. much success had, still believe mongodb early stage realizing full potential continues take share one largest market software. now, turning result quarter. begin detailed review third-quarter result finish outlook fourth quarter full fiscal year 2025. first, start third quarter results. total revenue quarter $529.4 million, 22% year-over-year high end guidance. shifting product mix, atlas grew 26% quarter compared previous year represents 68% total revenue compared 66% third quarter fiscal 2024 71% last quarter. recognized atlas revenue primarily based customer consumption platform consumption closely tied end user activity applications. let provide context atlas consumption quarter. q3, consumption slightly ahead expectations. year's q3 seasonal improvement muted year past expected. year-over-year basis, consumption growth remains prior year period. turning non-atlas revenue. non-atlas came significantly ahead expectations. dev mentioned, ea new business strong, continue success selling incremental workload existing customer base. addition, q3 non-atlas revenue benefited large multi-year deals. know, due asc 606, recognized entire term license component multi-year contract start contract. compared q3 last year, multi-year license component non-atlas revenue $15 million higher. turning customer growth. third quarter, grew customer base approximately 1,900 customer sequentially, bringing total customer count 52,600, 46,400 year-ago period. total customer count, 7,400 direct sale customers, compare 6,900 year-ago period. growth total customer count driven primarily atlas, 51,100 customer end quarter compared 44,900 year-ago period. important keep mind growth atlas customer count reflects new customer mongodb addition existing ea customer adding first atlas workload. continuing on, q3, net arr expansion rate approximately 120%. ended quarter 2,314 customer least $100,000 arr annualized mrr, $1,972 year-ago period. moving income statement, discussing result non-gaap basis unless otherwise noted. gross profit third quarter $405.7 million, representing gross margin 77%, flat versus year-ago period. income operation $101.5 million 19% operating margin third quarter compared 18% operating margin year-ago period. primary reason favorable operating income result versus guidance revenue outperformance, including high margin multi-year license revenue benefit. net income third quarter $98.1 million $1.16 per share, based 84.2 million diluted weighted average share outstanding. compare net income $79.1 million $0.96 per share 83.7 million diluted weighted-average share outstanding year-ago period. turning balance sheet cash flow, ended third quarter $2.3 billion cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash. operating cash flow third quarter $37.4 million. taking consideration approximately $2.9 million capital expenditure principal repayment finance lease liabilities, free cash flow $34.6 million quarter. compare free cash flow $35 million year-ago period. q3, incur capital expenditure purchase ipv4 address previously expected, start making purchase november still expect total outlay $20 million $25 million fiscal year previously communicated. like turn outlook fourth quarter full fiscal year 2025. fourth quarter, expect revenue range $515 million $519 million. expect non-gaap income operation range $55 million $58 million non-gaap net income per share range $0.62 $0.65 based 84.9 million estimated diluted weighted-average share outstanding. full-fiscal year 2025, expect revenue range $1.973 billion $1.977 billion, non-gaap income operation range $242 million $245 million, non-gaap net income per share range $3.01 $3.03 based 84 million estimated diluted weighted-average share outstanding. note non-gaap net income per share guidance fourth-quarter full-fiscal year 2025 includes non-gaap tax provision approximately 20%. provide context around updated guidance. first, term atlas consumption, expect see typical seasonal slowdown q4, driven underlying application usage moderating holiday season. second, since atlas consumption remained lower year-over-year basis q3, expect see continued deceleration atlas year-over-year growth q4. third, expect see sequential decline non-atlas revenue q4, contrary normal pattern. reason experienced significant additional benefit multi-year deal q3, expect recur q4. addition, want provide incremental color recent product -- recent product go-to-market change impact growth reported customer count going forward. first, dev explained, reallocating portion go-to-market resource mid-market enterprise channel. result, expect see significantly fewer mid-market direct sale customer net addition result, slower direct sale customer growth going forward. believe reallocation investment dollar drive higher revenue growth time. so, trade-off make sense. second, introduce atlas flex cluster q4 automatically migrate customer q1, expect see one-time negative impact customer count since approximately 4,000 serverless customer low spending expect transition flex. customer negligible impact revenue impact reported customer count. summarize, pleased third quarter result especially ability win new business. small share one largest fastest-growing market software number secular tailwinds, including ai back. continue investing judiciously focusing execution capture long-term opportunity. that, like open questions. operator? question & answers: operator [operator instructions] first question day coming sanjit singh morgan stanley. line open. sanjit singh -- analyst thank taking question congrats, michael, outstanding career. absolutely fantastic run mongodb. excited see next, excited take breather. congrats, michael. guess take question -- start questions, look atlas past two quarters, correct wrong, think consumption coming least modestly ahead expectations. relative seen beginning year, sort -- function sale execution? function end-user activity sort improving? what's driving least improvement atlas consumption past two quarters? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. different things. think look outlook beginning year, indicated thought would see stable atlas growth consumption standpoint. seen talked -- actually seen lower year-over-year growth based underlying consumption. -- that's incorporated q4 guide. seen q3 q4 -- sorry, q2 q3, excuse me, better expectations, still year-over-year basis. want make sure sort confusing comparative set year-over-year versus relative expectations. sanjit singh -- analyst understood. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer core it, sanjit, question really underlying usage applications. sanjit singh -- analyst yeah, make total sense. then, dev, ask ai agent question. term ai agent needing context, going set tool take actions. mean mongodb operational data store customer start roll agentic applications? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. so, talk agents, think think agents, there's jobs, there's -- sorry, there's job, there's project there's task. right now, agent rolled really focused task like say something sierra company rolling agents. right, deemed deal able create rich complex data structures. important ai ai model look isolated data points, need understand relationships, hierarchies, pattern within data. need able essentially get real-time insights. example, chatbot someone querying, customer kind trying get update order placed five minute ago may gotten confirmation, chatbot need able deal real-time information. need able deal basically handling advanced use cases, understanding like, thing like fraud detection understand behavior supply chains, need understand intricate data relationships. thing consistent mongodb offers. believe end day, well-positioned handle this. thing would say embedded natural way search vector search. oltp database, tech search vector search. that's one experience platform offer that, think real advantage. integrated leading ai framework platforms. enterprise-grade security compliance, customer run u anywhere, either 118 cloud region on-prem, huge differentiator us. sanjit singh -- analyst awesome. appreciate thoughts, dev. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, sanjit. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line taylor -- tyler radke citi. line open. tyler radke -- analyst hi, thank much taking question. and, michael, best, congratulation 10 years. going back sale execution, mean, one thing talked earlier year challenge term recently acquired workload ramping. think lot past fiscal year. curious quality workload acquisition trended year. think ramp consumption potential next year, sort look versus time year ago? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. maybe talk change made michael talk little bit consumption trends. so, make change beginning year, really wanted focus volume quality workload slight adjustment made. think change reasonable positive impact. again, early declare victory workload usually start small grow time, really pleased result seeing far. -- again, early days. obviously, know fiscal '25 workload go fiscal '26. far, good. michael, consumption? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, couple things, thanks, tyler. fiscal '24 cohort called earlier, slower growth continue. line revised expectations. made change talked -- earlier year affect fiscal '25 cohorts, early tell. those, need quarter data really see -- seeing behave differently. say talked new business environment success new business. pleased that, show kind initial piece, need see grow cohort evolve. tyler radke -- analyst great. thanks. follow-up ea side, talked outsized strength non-atlas business quarter. maybe could unpack like relative upside driven simply duration versus new business. know called duration impact year-over-year, -- feel like sort one-off feel like maybe bigger customer indexing toward ea impact way think product introducing thing like vector search stream processing onto on-prem product? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah, thank you. overall, continue find ea product resonate customers. important part run anywhere strategy continued see success people wanting increase investment mongodb. there's always multiyear component continue see that. talked beginning year fiscal '24 abnormally high amount multi-year benefit therefore, anticipating headwind quantified roughly $40 million range. talked call earlier saw large accounts, surprising amount multiyear positively benefited q3 little $15 million revenue compared saw q3 year ago. so, much headwind expecting. obviously, 606 dynamics, things, especially large deal kind meaty chunky lumpy, try call sort help people understand, there's pretty healthy kind baseline flow, ea, also multiyear. see spikes, try call you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. want add, tyler, investing call ea business. first, starting investing search vector search community product. couple thing us. one, whenever anyone start mongodb open-source product, immediately get benefit complete highly integrated platform. two, capability migrate ea. so, ea u investment strategy. definitely see lot large customer very, committed running workload on-prem. even see customer want run run ai workload on-prem. so, optionality get using mongodb on-prem cloud, also cross-cloud compelling one. tyler radke -- analyst thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line brad reback stifel. line open. brad reback -- analyst great. thanks much. and, michael, best luck. great run. dev, started call talking bunch investments, great given growth business. obviously, talked reallocating expenses. net-net, think incremental investment phase next year gating margin upside? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer think that's something obviously ready talk next year now, would say -- reason looking invest summarize again, going up-market legacy app modernization see large workload potentially play ideal database genai apps, future important investment drive long-term growth. quite energized investment that's something high conviction on. brad reback -- analyst that's great. maap program, workload going wind atlas healthy combination ea atlas? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer think early days. would say -- would probably say side atlas ea early days. think introduce search vector search ea product, see on-prem. obviously, people use mongodb ai workload using technology well conjunction mongodb on-prem ai use cases. would say probably going see happen first atlas. brad reback -- analyst great. thanks much. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line jason ader william blair. line open. jason ader -- analyst yeah, thank you. going belabor congratulating michael, fun working best luck. question strength ea. think, dev, represents comment enterprise might rethinking reassessing kind on-prem versus cloud workload placement decision? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer well, think large enterprises, think large enterprise meaningful workload still running on-prem. think belief everything would go cloud probably something really popular good old day zurp. think customer assess investment already place, much judicious run workload think leverage existing investment infrastructure, going so. also bunch reason like regulatory reasons, customer quite moving aggressively cloud. see particularly europe, see lot european bank still running majority workload on-prem. also varies region conversely asia, seeing people much move much aggressively cloud. think really depends industry, geography, personal dynamic what's happening particular account. mean, see large u bank also committed running thing on-prem. really varies. that's feel really good run anywhere strategy give customer optionality. build something run on-prem. choose move cloud, easy mongodb. jason ader -- analyst right. follow-up also investment making strategic sale enterprise. could get little specific investment might be? hiring lot new salespeople? working sis, investing sis? additional detail would helpful. thanks. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. everyone's benefit, identified number accounts, call strategic accounts, think high upside us. seen number account grow quickly deploy right mix resources. necessarily quota-carrying resources. could additional technical sale resources, additional p resources, additional customer service resource better service support accounts. even thing like run education session developer accounts, called either hackathons like call developer day even design review meet development team looking build application, help think would potentially use mongodb build particular app. find many developers, experience mongodb quite limited, engage them, educate show simple easy is. like example, customer today think like use oltp database, search database, maybe vector database, like caching database. integrated mongodb. sudden, customer say, wow, simplify life, simplify back-end infrastructure, build app far quickly much easier manage long-term everything mongodb. really function educating power mongodb really open lot opportunity us. that's doubling down, mix resource really predicated accounts, quota counting resources, whole suite resource bringing table. jason ader -- analyst thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line andrew nowinski well fargo. line open. andrew nowinski -- analyst okay. good afternoon. thank much taking question congrats nice quarter. gave example customer migrated postgres think said issue pg vector function. wondering long customer using postgres decided make change mongo, meaning sort like rebound type customer chose pg -- excuse me, postgres work? frequently seeing type transition? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. can't give specific long using postgres, -- trend seeing business. remember postgres 40-year-old technology. -- beneficiary people lifting shifting type relational databases, oracle, sql server, mysql, et cetera. open-source database. part -- open-source relational database, inherent challenge relational database do. quite inflexible. build schema, hard change schema. hard scale hard distribute data. large data volumes, weird thing like, example, resort off-road storage large data objects, creates performance bottlenecks. again, people default postgres know anything better know relational everyone kind moving relational platforms. that's whole point saying earlier. educate developer flexibility schema, easily horizontally scale rich query language aggregation sophisticated geospatial indexes, productivity gain using document model easy organize data, -- people like, wow, life much easier. want clear, zero-sum game. postgres fail u successful. big market quite excited opportunity, see customer moving postgres coming mongodb. andrew nowinski -- analyst thank you. helpful. maybe quick follow-up. normalize $15 million multiyear deal impact q3, would ea still sequentially q4? thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer given level guidance, trying help understand context full-year number headwind talked beginning year, given strength saw q3. andrew nowinski -- analyst got it. thanks. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line raimo lenschow barclays. line open. raimo lenschow -- analyst hey, thank you. think ea strength quarter, michael, kind give u little bit there. like think renewal -- renewal situation renewal pool coming like q3, coming q4, et cetera, well like mean term upsell, cross-sell opportunity people think starting ai project self-serve, kind mentioned earlier call? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. think -- think ea q4, tends large renewal quarter, talking term guide strength multiyear, that's would expect see ea sequentially, typically pattern, called out. term ai workload things, think early tell obviously, continue evolve assess view get full-year guide march. also updated view cohort behaving sort multiyear played out. think term q4, comment made earlier hopefully help. raimo lenschow -- analyst yeah. okay, perfect. -- talk little bit like obviously, there's debate like database persistent layer ai projects, et cetera. see big hyperscalers term working guy partnerships? obviously aws kind summit, et-cetera. speak little bit like relationship big guy evolving around this? michael, best case talk you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. so, start partnership first, like -- aws, said, re:invent show last week. -- remains very, strong. closed ton deal past quarter. very, large deals. integration new product like q bedrock engagement field really strong. azure, think -- shared past, start-off little bit slow start, word person run partner leadership, azure mongodb relationship never stronger. closed large number deals. part what's called azure native ic service program bunch deep integration azure, including fabric, power bi, visual studio, semantic kernel, azure openai studio. also one azure's largest marketplace partners. gcp -- actually seen uptick term co-sales done past quarter gcp made comp change -- favorable working mongodb saw result field, focused closing -- closing handful large deal gcp q4. general, would say, thing going quite well. term of, guess, implying question like hyperscalers potentially bundling thing along ai offerings? mean, candidly, since day one, hyperscalers bundling database offering every offering that's predominant strategy. -- think executed well strategy database like by-the-way decision. important decision. think hyperscalers seeing performance realize better partner us. said, customer understand importance data layer, especially ai applications. partnership across three hyperscalers strong. raimo lenschow -- analyst ok, perfect. thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer thanks, raimo. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line brad sill bank america. line open. brad sill -- analyst great. thank much, congratulations, michael, next move. wanted ask new workload vector search, stream processing, relational migrator. one three that's ramping faster maybe expected? little bit color new workload type ramping. thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. kind give rundown -- mean, essentially asking new products, like -- search, introduced new capability called atlas search nodes, asymmetrically scale search node search-intensive use case, scale node become quite expensive. seen kind groundbreaking capability really well received. demand quite high customer like tune configuration unique need search requirements. one world's largest bank using atlas search provide like google-like search experience payment data massive corporate customers. customer-facing application performance, scalability critical. leading provider ai-powered accounting software us atlas search power invoice analytics future, allows end user finance team perform ad-hoc analysis easily find past-due invoice voice contain errors. search -- vector search, -- again, kind first full-year since going generally available. product uptake actually very, high. q3, released quantization atlas vector search, reduces memory requirement 96%, allowing u support larger vector workload vastly improved price performance. example, multinational news organization created genai powered tool designed help producer journalist efficiently search, summarize, verify information vast varied data sources. leading security firm using atlas vector search fight ai fraud leading global medium company replaced elastic search hybrid search vector search use case user recommendation engine that's built suggest -- that's built suggest article end users. that's super exciting see well. also seeing lot interest streaming product, demand high. rolled another hyperscaler, customer commenting use case able embed stream processing mongodb make life

Welcome to the MongoDB third-quarter fiscal year 2025 conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there'll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your speaker for today, Brian Denyeau. Please go ahead. Brian Raferty Denyeau -- Investor Relations Thank you, Lisa. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today to review MongoDB's third-quarter fiscal 2025 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued after the close of the market today. Joining me the call today are Dev Ittycheria, president and CEO of MongoDB; and Michael Gordon, MongoDB's COO and CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our market and future growth opportunities, our expectations for the macroeconomic environment in fiscal 2025 and the impact of AI, the benefits of our product platform, our competitive landscape, customer behaviors, our financial guidance, and our planned investments in growth opportunities in AI. These statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including the results of operations and financial condition that cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. For a discussion of the material risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please refer to the risks described in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 31st, 2024 that we filed with the SEC on August 30th, 2024. Any forward-looking statements made on this call reflect our views only as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them except as required by law. Additionally, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures on this conference call. Please refer to the tables in our earnings release in the Investor Relations portion of our website for a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dev. Dev? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we had a strong quarter of new business and executed well against our large market opportunity. Let's begin by reviewing our third quarter results before giving you a broader company update. We generated revenue of $529 million, a 22% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew 26% year-over-year, representing 68% of total revenue. We generated non-GAAP operating income of $101 million for a 19% non-GAAP operating margin and we ended the quarter with over 52,600 customers. Overall, we were pleased with our performance in the third quarter. We had a strong new business quarter and we're happy with our new workload acquisition on Atlas. Our non-Atlas business significantly exceeded expectations in part because we benefited from a few large multi-year deals as customers continue to value our run anywhere strategy and want to build a deeper longer-term relationship with MongoDB. Atlas consumption was slightly better than expected in a macro-environment that we would characterize as largely consistent with what we saw in the first half of the year. Michael will cover consumption trends in more detail. Retention rates remained strong in Q3, demonstrating the mission criticality of our platform. On our Q1 earnings call, we shared with you the three major strategic initiatives that we believe will enable us to maximize our long-term opportunity. I want to give you an update on the progress we're making on those initiatives. First, we are increasing our investment in the enterprise channel since we see the strongest returns in this part of the market. Specifically, we're expanding our strategic account program going to next year, as we see more accounts that will benefit from incremental investment. In addition, we're investing time and resources to educate developers in large enterprise accounts and uplevel their MongoDB skills. These organizations have thousands of developers and as we penetrate them more deeply, we encounter developers who have historically only built SQL applications and simply do not know how to use MongoDB to its full potential. In our experience, educating these developers on the benefits of MongoDB drives significant incremental adoption of our platform. To fund these up-market investments, we are reallocating a portion of our mid-market investments. The mid-market remains an attractive opportunity for us, but we believe that prioritizing investment up-market will deliver strong returns in the current environment. We also believe there are additional ways to serve the mid-market more efficiently through our self-serve channel and other scaled technology-enabled sales and customer service motions. Second, we are optimistic about the opportunity to accelerate legacy app modernization using AI and are investing more in this area. As you recall, we ran a few successful pilots earlier this year, demonstrating that AI tooling combined with professional services and our relational migrator product can significantly reduce the time, cost, and risk of migrating legacy applications onto MongoDB. While it's early days, we have observed a more than 50% reduction in the cost to modernize. On the back of these strong early results, additional customer interest is exceeding our expectations. Large enterprises in every industry and geography are experiencing acute pain from their legacy infrastructure and are eager for more agile, performant, and cost-effective solutions. Not only are customers excited to engage with us, they also want to focus on some of the most important applications in their enterprise, further demonstrating the level of interest and size of the long-term opportunity. As relational applications encompass a wide variety of database types, programming languages, versions, and other customer-specific variables, we expect modernization projects to continue to include meaningful service engagements in the short and medium term. Consequently, we're increasing our professional services delivery capabilities, both directly and through partners. In the long run, we expect to automate and simplify large parts of the modernization process. To that end, we are leveraging the learnings from early service engagement to develop new tools to accelerate future modernization efforts. Although it's early days and scaling our legacy app modernization capabilities will take time, we have increased conviction that this motion will significantly add to our growth in the long term. Third, we are investing to capitalize on our inherent technical advantages as a key component of the emerging AI tech stack. As a reminder, MongoDB is uniquely equipped to query rich and complex data structures typical of AI applications. The ability of a database to query rich and complex data structures is crucial because AI applications often rely on highly detailed, interrelated, and nuanced data to make accurate predictions and decisions. For example, a recommendation system doesn't just analyze a single customer's purchase but also considers their browsing history, peer group behavior, and product categories requiring a database that can query and interlink these complex data structures. In addition, MongoDB's architecture unifies source data, metadata, operational data, and vector data in an all-in-one platform, updating the need for multiple database systems and complex back-end architectures. This enables a more compelling developer experience than any other alternative. From what we see in the AI market today, most customers are still in the experimental stage as they work to understand the effectiveness of the underlying tech stack and build early proof-of-concept applications. However, we are seeing an increasing number of AI apps in production. Today, we have thousands of AI apps on our platform. What we don't yet see is many of these apps actually achieving meaningful product market fit and therefore significant traction. In fact, as you take a step back and look at the entire universe of AI apps, a very small percentage of them have achieved the type of scale that we commonly see with enterprise-specific applications. We do have some AI apps that are growing quickly, including one that is already a seven-figure workload that has grown 10 times since the beginning of the year. Similar to prior platform shifts as the usefulness of AI tech improves and becomes more cost-effective, we will see the emergence of many more AI apps that do nail product market fit, but it's difficult to predict when that will happen more broadly. We remain confident that we will capture our fair share of these successful AI applications as we see that our platform is popular with developers building more sophisticated AI use cases. We continue investing in our product capabilities, including enterprise-grade Atlas Vector Search functionality to build on this momentum and even better position MongoDB to capture the AI opportunity. In addition, as previously announced, we are bringing search and vector service to our community and EA offerings, leveraging our run anywhere competitive advantage in the world of AI. Finally, we are expanding our MongoDB AI applications program or MAAP, which helps enterprise customers build and bring AI applications into production by providing them with reference architectures, integrations with leading tech providers, and coordinated services and support. Last week, we announced a new code of partners including McKinsey, Confluent, Capgemini, and Unstructured, as well as the collaboration with Meta to enable developers to build AI-enriched applications on MongoDB using Llama. Next, I'd like to provide you with a brief product update. At our dot local developer conference in London in October, we announced the general availability of MongoDB 8.0, the fastest and most performant version of MongoDB ever. MongoDB 8.0 performs 20% to 60% better against common industry benchmarks compared to our prior version and is built to exceed our customers' most stringent security, resiliency, availability, and performance requirements. To best serve our customers, we regularly review and reprioritize investments in our product portfolio to ensure we're allocating our resources to products with the highest demand from our customers. And to do that, we also deprecate products that are not showing results we desired. Consequently, we made the decision to consolidate our Atlas serverless offerings with our smallest dedicated tiers to create Atlas Flex customers, a new offering with a simpler architecture that provides the elasticity features akin to serverless. We will begin migrating effective customers to the single, simple, entry-level solution in Q4. We also decided to deprecate Atlas DeviceSync and other capabilities not widely adopted in order to focus our engineering resources on the core platform. While these reprioritization decisions are not made lightly, they allow us to deliver the most value to the largest number of customers, reinforcing our commitment to being the best modern database and helping us to grow faster. Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the adoption trends of MongoDB across our customer base. Customers across industries and around the world are running mission-critical projects in MongoDB Atlas, leveraging the full power of our developer data platform, including Financial Times, CarGurus, and Victoria's Secret. As part of the digital transformation journey, global specialty retailer Victoria's Secret & Company migrated its e-commerce platform to MongoDB Atlas. As a fully managed platform, MongoDB Atlas allowed the company to simplify its architecture and improve performance, supporting the retailer to provide a resilient, secure, and fast web and mobile e-commerce experience for their millions of customers around the world. Allianz, Alphamad, Swiss Post, and Paylocity are turning to MongoDB to modernize applications. Paylocity, a leading provider of cloud-based payroll and human capital management software, selected MongoDB to power proprietary application aimed at fostering employee connections and engagement. When traffic increased and the original SQL-based solution was unable to keep up with the required performance metrics, Paylocity migrated to MongoDB Atlas to take advantage of the flexible schema architecture, performance, and scalability. MongoDB costs five times less than the previous SQL database solution and the company's developers can now create an application within minutes, something that used to take weeks. Mature companies and start-ups alike are using MongoDB to help deliver the next wave of AI-powered application to customers, including NerdWallet, Cisco, and Tealbook. Tealbook, a supplier intelligence platform, migrated from Postgres, pgvector, and ElasticSearch to MongoDB to eliminate technical debt and consolidate their tech stack. The company experienced workload isolation and scalability issues in pgvector and were concerned with the search index inconsistencies, which were all resolved with the migration to MongoDB. With Atlas Vector search and dedicated search nodes, Tealbook has realized improved cost-efficiency and increased scalability for the supplier data platform, an application that uses GenAI to collect, verify, and enrich supplier data across various sources. In summary, we had a healthy Q3 with both Atlas and EA exceeding expectations. We saw a strong new business quarter and we remain confident in our ability to become an increasing strategic provider in our large and growing market. Looking forward, we see a great opportunity to grow our adoption in the enterprise through new workloads, modernizing legacy applications, and winning the next generation of AI-powered applications. I would like to finish by providing an update on our senior leadership. First, as we announced early in the press release, after nearly 10 years, Michael Gordon has made the decision to leave MongoDB. Michael has been instrumental in MongoDB's success over the past decade, leading our successful IPO, helping us grow our revenue nearly 50-fold, and scaling -- and successfully scaling our business model to generate meaningful operating leverage. He has been a trusted advisor and business partner to the Board and me over the years and also has become a personal friend. Michael is excited to take a well-deserved break. We have commenced the search for Michael's replacement and will be evaluating both internal and external candidates. One of Michael's proudest compliments -- accomplishments has been building a world-class finance team under his leadership, and I'm confident that we will not miss a beat during this transition. Michael will continue to serve as CFO through January 31st to help us finish the fiscal year and then will transition to an Advisor to the company to ensure a seamless process. If we have not named Michael's successor by fiscal year-end, Serge Tanjga, SVP of Finance, will serve as Interim CFO, beginning on February 1st. Second, we are promoting Cedric Pech, currently our chief revenue officer to the newly created role of president worldwide field operations. In this new position, Cedric will oversee all our field-based customer-facing and go-to-market enablement teams, including professional services. We believe this org structure will best enable us to execute on some of the key strategic initiatives I discussed earlier, in particular, our increased focus on up-market and the app monetization opportunity. I would like to congratulate Cedric on this well-deserved promotion. With that, let me turn the call over to Michael. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Dev, and thanks for the kind words and our incredible partnership over the past decade. The past 10 years have been the most rewarding in my professional career and I'm extremely proud of what we've achieved together and of course, to the whole MongoDB team. With as much success as we had, I still believe that MongoDB is in the early stages of realizing its full potential as it continues to take share in one of the largest markets in software. Now, turning to the results for the quarter. I'll begin with a detailed review of our third-quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025. First, I'll start with our third quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $529.4 million, up 22% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance. Shifting to our product mix, Atlas grew 26% in the quarter compared to the previous year and now represents 68% of total revenue compared to 66% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and 71% last quarter. We recognized Atlas revenue primarily based on customer consumption of our platform and that consumption is closely tied to end user activity of their applications. Let me provide some context on Atlas consumption in the quarter. In Q3, consumption was slightly ahead of our expectations. This year's Q3 seasonal improvement was more muted than in years past as expected. On a year-over-year basis, consumption growth remains below that of prior year period. Turning to non-Atlas revenue. Non-Atlas came in significantly ahead of our expectations. As Dev mentioned, EA new business was strong, and we continue to have success selling incremental workloads into our existing customer base. In addition, our Q3 non-Atlas revenue benefited from a few large multi-year deals. As you know, due to ASC 606, we recognized the entire term license component of a multi-year contract at the start of that contract. Compared to Q3 of last year, the multi-year license component of non-Atlas revenues was over $15 million higher. Turning to customer growth. During the third quarter, we grew our customer base by approximately 1,900 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 52,600, which is up from over 46,400 in the year-ago period. Of our total customer count, over 7,400 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 6,900 in the year-ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven primarily by Atlas, which had over 51,100 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 44,900 in the year-ago period. It is important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers adding their first Atlas workload. Continuing on, in Q3, our net ARR expansion rate was approximately 120%. We ended the quarter with 2,314 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, up from $1,972 in the year-ago period. Moving down the income statement, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the third quarter was $405.7 million, representing a gross margin of 77%, which is flat versus the year-ago period. Our income from operations was $101.5 million or 19% operating margin for the third quarter compared to an 18% operating margin in the year-ago period. The primary reason for more favorable operating income results versus guidance is our revenue outperformance, including the very high margin multi-year license revenue benefit. Net income in the third quarter was $98.1 million or $1.16 per share, based on 84.2 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a net income of $79.1 million or $0.96 per share on 83.7 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding in the year-ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the third quarter with $2.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $37.4 million. After taking into consideration approximately $2.9 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was $34.6 million in the quarter. This compares to free cash flow of $35 million in the year-ago period. In Q3, we did not incur capital expenditures to purchase IPV4 addresses as we previously expected, but we did start making those purchases in November and still expect a total outlay of $20 million to $25 million this fiscal year as we previously communicated. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $515 million to $519 million. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $55 million to $58 million and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.65 based on 84.9 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. For the full-fiscal year 2025, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.973 billion to $1.977 billion, non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $242 million to $245 million, and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $3.01 to $3.03 based on 84 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. Note that the non-GAAP net income per share guidance for the fourth-quarter and full-fiscal year 2025 includes a non-GAAP tax provision of approximately 20%. I'll now provide some more context around our updated guidance. First, in terms of Atlas consumption, we expect to see a typical seasonal slowdown in Q4, driven by underlying application usage moderating during the holiday season. Second, since Atlas consumption remained lower on a year-over-year basis in Q3, we expect to see continued deceleration of Atlas year-over-year growth in Q4. Third, we expect to see a sequential decline in non-Atlas revenue in Q4, which is contrary to our normal pattern. The reason for this is that we experienced a significant additional benefit from multi-year deals in Q3, which we do not expect to recur in Q4. In addition, I want to provide some incremental color on some of our recent product and -- how some of our recent product and go-to-market changes will impact the growth of our reported customer count going forward. First, as Dev explained, we are reallocating a portion of our go-to-market resources from the mid-market to the enterprise channel. As a result, we expect to see significantly fewer mid-market direct sales customer net additions and as a result, slower direct sales customer growth going forward. We believe this reallocation of investment dollars will drive higher revenue growth over time. So, it's a trade-off that makes sense. Second, as we introduce Atlas Flex clusters in Q4 and automatically migrate customers in Q1, we expect to see a one-time negative impact to our customer count since we have approximately 4,000 serverless customers who are very low spending and we do not expect them to transition over to Flex. These customers have a negligible impact on our revenue but will impact our reported customer count. To summarize, we're pleased with our third quarter results and especially our ability to win new business. We have a small share in one of the largest and fastest-growing markets in all of software with a number of secular tailwinds, including AI at our back. We'll continue investing judiciously and focusing on our execution to capture this long-term opportunity. With that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator? Questions & Answers: Operator [Operator instructions] Our first question for the day will be coming from Sanjit Singh of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Thank you for taking the questions and congrats, Michael, on outstanding career. You had an absolutely fantastic run at MongoDB. I'm excited to see what you do next, or excited if you just take a breather. So congrats, Michael. I guess to take the question -- to start off with the questions, when we look at what Atlas has been doing in the past two quarters, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think consumption is coming in at least modestly ahead of your expectations. Relative to what we've seen at the beginning of the year, what sort of -- is it a function of sales execution? Is it a function of the end-user activity sort of improving? What's driving at least the improvement in Atlas consumption in the past two quarters? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So a few different things. So I think if you look at our outlook at the beginning of the year, we had indicated that we thought we would see stable Atlas growth from a consumption standpoint. What we've seen and what we've talked about is -- we've actually seen lower year-over-year growth based on the underlying consumption. And so -- and that's incorporated into our Q4 guide. We have seen the Q3 and Q4 be -- sorry, Q2 and Q3, excuse me, be better than our expectations, but it's still down on a year-over-year basis. And so I want to make sure that we're not sort of confusing the comparative set of year-over-year versus relative to our expectations. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Understood. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer And the core of it, Sanjit, to your question is really the underlying usage of the applications. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Yeah, that makes total sense. And then, Dev, I have to ask you the AI agent question. In terms of an AI agent needing more context, it has going to have a set of tools to take its actions. What does it mean for MongoDB as an operational data store as customers start to roll out more agentic applications? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, just to talk about agents, I think when you think about agents, there's jobs, there's -- sorry, there's a job, there's projects and then there's task. Right now, the agents that are being rolled out are really focused on task like say something from Sierra or some other companies are rolling out agents. But you're right, what they deemed to do is to deal with being able to create a rich and complex data structures. Now why is this important for AI is that AI models don't just look at isolated data points, but they need to understand relationships, hierarchies, and patterns within the data. They need to be able to essentially get real-time insights. For example, if you have a chatbot where someone is querying, a customer is kind of trying to get some update on the order they placed five minutes ago because they may have not gotten any confirmation, your chatbot needs to be able to deal with real-time information. You need to be able to deal with basically handling very advanced use cases, understanding like, to do things like fraud detection to understand behaviors of supply chains, you need to understand intricate data relationships. All these things are consistent with MongoDB offers. And so we believe that at the end of the day, we are well-positioned to handle this. And the other thing that I would say is that we've embedded in a very natural way of search and vector search. So we're just not an OLTP database, we do tech search and vector search. That's all one experience and no other platform offers that, and we think we have a real advantage. And so we're integrated with the leading AI frameworks and platforms. We have enterprise-grade security and compliance, and customers can run us anywhere, either on 118 cloud regions or on-prem, and that again is a huge differentiator for us. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Awesome. Appreciate the thoughts, Dev. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Sanjit. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Taylor -- Tyler Radke of Citi. Your line is open. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Hi, thank you very much for taking the question. And, Michael, all the best, and congratulations on 10 years. Going back to the sales execution, I mean, one of the things that you talked about earlier this year was some challenges just in terms of the recently acquired workloads ramping. And I think a lot of those were from the past fiscal year. So curious how the quality of workload acquisition has trended this year. And as you think about the ramp in consumption potential into next year, how does that sort of look versus this time a year ago? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Maybe I'll just talk about what we're doing and the changes we made and then Michael can talk a little bit about the consumption trends. So, we did make some changes at the beginning of the year, and we really wanted to focus on both the volume and the quality of the workloads and there were some slight adjustments that we made. We think those changes are having a reasonable positive impact. Again, it's too early to declare victory because these workloads usually start small and grow over time, but we're really pleased with the results we're seeing so far. And -- but again, it's early days. And obviously, we'll know about the fiscal '25 workloads as we go into fiscal '26. But so far, so good. Michael, on consumption? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, just a couple of things, and thanks, Tyler. The fiscal '24 cohorts that we called out earlier, that slower growth does continue. They've been in line with our revised expectations. We made some changes that we talked about at the -- earlier in the year that should affect the fiscal '25 cohorts, but it's just too early to tell. On those, we need a few more quarters of data before you can really see if we're -- how we're seeing those behave differently. I will say we've talked about the new business environment and our success in new business. We have been pleased with that, but that just shows kind of the initial piece, and we need to see how they grow and how those cohorts evolve. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Great. Thanks. And follow-up on the EA side, you talked about the outsized strength in non-Atlas business this quarter. Maybe if you could unpack like the relative upside that was driven by simply duration versus new business. I know you called out the duration impact year-over-year, but are -- do you feel like this was sort of a one-off or do you feel like maybe some of your bigger customers are indexing more toward EA and how does that impact the way you think about the product and introducing things like vector search and stream processing onto the on-prem product? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, thank you. So overall, we continue to find the EA product resonate with customers. It's an important part of the run anywhere strategy and we've continued to see success with that and people wanting to increase their investment in MongoDB. There's always been a multiyear component and we continue to see that. We talked about that at the beginning of the year as to how fiscal '24 had an abnormally high amount of multi-year benefit and therefore, we were anticipating that being a headwind and we quantified that in roughly the $40 million range. What we talked about on this call earlier is we saw from a few large accounts, a surprising amount of multiyear that positively benefited Q3 at a little more than $15 million in revenue compared to what we saw Q3 a year ago. So, not as much of a headwind as we had been expecting. Obviously, with the 606 dynamics, some of these things, especially for a large deal can be kind of meaty and chunky and lumpy, which is why we try and call it out and sort of help people understand, but there's a pretty healthy kind of baseline flow, not just of EA, but also of multiyear. And when we see spikes, we just try and call it out for you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I just want to add, Tyler, that we are investing in our what we call our EA business. First, we're starting by investing with search and vector search and a community product. That does a couple of things for us. One, whenever anyone starts with MongoDB with the open-source product, they immediately get all the benefits of that complete highly integrated platform. Two, those capabilities will then migrate to EA. So, EA for us is an investment strategy. We definitely see lots of large customers who are very, very committed to running workloads on-prem. We even see some customers want to run to run AI workloads on-prem. So, the optionality they get by using MongoDB to not just be on-prem and the cloud, but also cross-cloud is a very compelling one. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Brad Reback of Stifel. Your line is open. Brad Reback -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. And, Michael, best of luck. It's been a great run. Dev, you started the call talking about a bunch of investments, which are great given the growth of the business. And obviously, you talked about reallocating some expenses. But net-net, should we think about this incremental investment phase next year as gating margin upside? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think that's something that we obviously are not ready to talk about next year just now, but I would say that we -- the reason we're looking to invest and just to summarize again, going up-market on legacy app modernization where we see very large workloads potentially at play and being the ideal database for GenAI apps, which is the future as important investments to drive long-term growth. And we're quite energized by those investments and that's something that we have high conviction on. Brad Reback -- Analyst That's great. And then on the MAAP program, are most of those workloads going to wind up in Atlas or will that be a healthy combination of EA and Atlas? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think it's again early days. I would say -- I would probably say more on the side of Atlas and EA in the early days. I think once we introduce a search and vector search into the EA product, you'll see more of that on-prem. Obviously, people can use MongoDB for AI workloads using other technologies as well in conjunction with MongoDB for on-prem AI use cases. But I would say you're probably going to see that happen first in Atlas. Brad Reback -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Jason Ader of William Blair. Your line is open. Jason Ader -- Analyst Yeah, thank you. I'm not going to belabor congratulating Michael, but it has been it has been fun working with you and best of luck. The question I had is on the strength in EA. Do you think, Dev, it represents a comment on how enterprises might be rethinking or reassessing the kind of on-prem versus cloud workload placement decision? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Well, when I think about large enterprises, I think large enterprises have meaningful workloads that are still running on-prem. I think the belief that everything would go to the cloud was probably something that was really popular in the good old days of Zurp. But I think now as customers assess their investments that they already have in place, they're being much more judicious about where they run those workloads and if they think they can leverage their existing investments in their own infrastructure, then they're going to do so. Also for a bunch of other reasons like regulatory reasons, some customers are quite not moving as aggressively to the cloud. We see that in particularly in Europe, where we see a lot of the European banks still running majority of the workloads on-prem. So it also varies by region where conversely in Asia, we're seeing people much move much more aggressively to the cloud. So I think it really depends on industry, on geography, and on the personal dynamics of what's happening in that particular account. I mean, we see some large US banks are also very committed to running things on-prem. So it really varies. And that's why we feel really good about our run anywhere strategy because it gives customer optionality. They can build something and run on-prem. And if and when they choose to move to the cloud, it's very easy to do so with MongoDB. Jason Ader -- Analyst All right. And then just as a follow-up also on the investments you're making in strategic sales and enterprise. Could you just get a little more specific on what those investments might be? Is it hiring a lot of new salespeople? Is it working more with SIs, investing more in SIs? Any additional detail would be helpful. Thanks. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So just for everyone's benefit, we've identified a number of accounts, which we call strategic accounts, which we think that have high upside for us. We've seen a number of accounts that grow very quickly when we deploy the right mix of resources. Now they're all not necessarily quota-carrying resources. They could be additional technical sales resources, additional PS resources, additional customer service resources to better service and support those accounts. We even do things like run education sessions for developers of the accounts, they're called either hackathons or like what we call developer days or even design reviews where we'll meet with our development teams who are looking to build an application, help them think about how they would potentially use MongoDB to build that particular app. And what we find is that because many of these developers, the experience with MongoDB is quite limited, the more we can engage with them, the more we can educate them and the more we can show them how simple and easy it is. Like for example, most customers today think like they have to use an OLTP database, then a search database, maybe a vector database, and then like a caching database. And all that is integrated in MongoDB. So all of a sudden, customers can say, wow, I can simplify my life, simplify my back-end infrastructure, build this app far more quickly and it will be much more easier to manage long-term if I do everything on MongoDB. And it's really a function of just educating them on the power of MongoDB that really opens up a lot of opportunities for us. So that's why we're doubling down, and the mix of resources is really predicated on the accounts, but it's not just quota counting resources, it's the whole suite of resources that we're bringing to the table. Jason Ader -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Andrew Nowinski of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Okay. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking the question and congrats on a nice quarter. You gave an example of a customer that migrated off Postgres and I think you said they had issues with their PG vector function. I was wondering how long was that customer using Postgres before they decided to make a change to Mongo, meaning was this some sort of like a rebound type customer where they chose PG -- or excuse me, Postgres and it didn't work? And then how frequently are you seeing this type of transition? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So I can't give you the specifics on how long they were using Postgres, but this is not -- this is a trend that we're seeing in our business. You have to remember Postgres is a 40-year-old technology. It's -- and they have been the beneficiary of people lifting and shifting from other types of relational databases, Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, et cetera. And they're an open-source database. And but as part -- because they're an open-source and relational database, they have the same inherent challenges all relational databases do. They're quite inflexible. So once you build a schema, it's very hard to change the schema. It's hard to scale and hard to distribute data. And if you have large data volumes, you have to do weird things like, for example, resort to off-road storage for large data objects, which creates performance bottlenecks. And so again, people default to Postgres if they don't know anything better because all they know is relational and everyone is kind of moving off those other relational platforms. And that's the whole point I was saying earlier. Once we educate developers on the flexibility of schema, how easily or horizontally scale the rich query language where you can do aggregations and do sophisticated geospatial indexes, the productivity gains by using the document model and how easy is to organize data, it's -- people are just like, wow, life is so much easier. Now I want to be clear, this is not a zero-sum game. Postgres does not have to fail for us to be successful. It's a big market and we're quite excited about the opportunity, but we do see customers moving off Postgres and coming to MongoDB. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Thank you. That was very helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up. If we normalize the $15 million multiyear deal impact you had in Q3, would EA still be down sequentially in Q4? Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer We haven't given that level of guidance, but just trying to help you understand in the context of the full-year numbers and the headwind that we talked about at the beginning of the year, just given the strength that we saw in Q3. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Got it. Thanks. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. The next question will be coming from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst Hey, thank you. And if you think about the EA strength this quarter, Michael, you'd kind of give us a little bit there. Like how should we think about renewal -- the renewal situation renewal pool coming up like or that you had in Q3, coming up in Q4, et cetera, as well and then like what does it mean in terms of upsell, cross-sell opportunity as people think about starting AI projects by self-serve, as you kind of mentioned earlier on the call? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So I think about -- if you think about EA for Q4, it tends to be a large renewal quarter, but what we're talking about in terms of the guide is because we had such strength in multiyear, that's where we would expect to see our EA down sequentially, which is not typically our pattern, which is why we called it out. In terms of AI workloads and some of those other things, I think it's early to tell and obviously, we'll continue to evolve and assess our view when we get to the full-year guide in March. And then we'll also have an updated view on how the cohorts are behaving and sort of how multiyear played out. But I think in terms of Q4, the comments that I made earlier hopefully will help. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst Yeah. Okay, perfect. And then the -- and can you talk a little bit about like obviously, there's a debate of like which database will be the persistent layer if you do AI projects, et cetera. What do you see from the big hyperscalers in terms of working with you guys and partnerships? We obviously just have AWS kind of summit, et-cetera. Can you speak a little bit like how your relationship with those big guys is evolving around this? And Michael, All the best in case I don't talk to you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, I'll start with the partnerships first, like our -- with AWS, as you said, they just had their re:Invent show last week. Our -- it remains very, very strong. We've closed a ton of deals this past quarter. Some of them very, very large deals. We're doing integrations to some of the new products like Q and Bedrock and the engagement in the field has been really strong. On Azure, I think we -- as I've shared in the past, we start-off with a little bit of a slow start, but in the words of the person who runs their partner leadership, the Azure MongoDB relationship has never been stronger. We've closed a large number of deals. We're part of what's called the Azure native IC service program and have a bunch of deep integrations with Azure, including Fabric, Power BI, Visual Studio, Semantic Kernel, and Azure OpenAI Studio. And we're also one of Azure's largest marketplace partners. And GCP does -- we have actually seen some uptick in terms of co-sales that we've done this past quarter and GCP made some comp changes where they -- that were favorable to working with MongoDB that we saw some results in the field, and we're focused on closing on -- closing a handful of large deals with GCP in Q4. So in general, I would say, things are going quite well. And then in terms of, I guess, implying your question was like the hyperscalers and are they potentially bundling things along with their AI offerings? I mean, candidly, since day one, the hyperscalers have been bundling their database offerings with every offering that they have and that's been their predominant strategy. And we've -- I think we've executed well against strategy because databases are not like a by-the-way decision. It's an important decision. And I think the hyperscalers are seeing our performance and realize it's better to partner with us. And as I said, customers understand the importance of the data layer, especially for AI applications. And so the partnership across all three hyperscalers is strong. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst OK, perfect. Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Raimo. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. The next question will be coming from the line of Brad Sills of Bank of America. Your line is open. Brad Sills -- Analyst Great. Thank you so much, and congratulations, Michael, on your next move. I wanted to ask about new workloads here on vector search, stream processing, relational migrator. Is there any one of those three that's ramping faster than maybe you expected? Just a little bit of color on how those new workload types are ramping. Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I'll kind of give you just a rundown of some of the -- I mean, essentially you're asking about the new products, like our -- on search, we introduced a new capability called Atlas search nodes, which where you can asymmetrically scale your search nodes because if you have a search-intensive use case, you don't have to scale all your nodes because they have become quite expensive. And we've seen that this kind of groundbreaking capability really well received. The demand is quite high and because customers like they can tune the configuration to the unique needs of their search requirements. One of the world's largest banks is using Atlas Search to provide like a Google-like search experience on payments data for massive corporate customers. So this is a customer-facing application and so performance, and scalability are critical. A leading provider of AI-powered accounting software uses Atlas Search to power its invoice analytics future, which allows end users and finance teams to perform ad-hoc analysis and easily find past-due invoices and voices that contain errors. So that search -- on vector search, it -- again, and it's been our kind of our first full-year since going generally available. And the product uptake has been actually very, very high. In Q3, we released quantization for Atlas Vector Search, which reduces the memory requirements by up to 96%, allowing us to support larger vector workloads with vastly improved price performance. For example, a multinational news organization created a GenAI powered tool designed to help producers and journalists efficiently search, summarize, and verify information from vast and varied data sources. A leading security firm is using Atlas Vector Search to fight AI fraud and a leading global media company replaced elastic search with hybrid search and vector search use case for a user recommendation engine that's built to suggest -- that's built in to suggest articles to end users. And so that's super exciting to see as well. We're also seeing a lot of interest in our streaming product, demand is very high. We just rolled it out to another hyperscaler, and customers are commenting on that the use cases of being able to embed stream processing with MongoDB makes our life so much easier. So overall, we're quite pleased with the progress we're making on the new products. And as I said before, natively bundling all these capabilities really reduces or eliminates the need for customers to have to bolt on a bunch of different technologies to solve the same problem, saving them a lot of time, money, cost, and risk. Brad Sills -- Analyst That's really exciting. Thanks, Dev. And then I wanted to ask a question around Cedric's appointment. Any focus that may be different here under his leadership that we should be thinking about going forward? Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer No, Cedric has been our CRO for, gosh, now like I think like five, six years, and he -- I was the Interim CRO for about three quarters until he took over when we last made a change and this is really an expansion of his responsibilities. I've known Cedric for a long time. He and I have worked with at multiple different companies. I think I have a good barometer for understanding sales leadership. There's a number of sales leaders who worked at other top-tier software companies who used to work for me or with me. And so I'm super-excited by the role Cedric is going to take and then we're also making some changes under Cedric to better align the different organizations so that we can more tightly work together on going up-market, on app monetization and positioning ourselves well to be the ideal database for GenAI apps. Brad Sills -- Analyst Super exciting. Thanks, Dev. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Brad. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question, please. Our next question will be coming from the line of Mike Cikos of Needham and Company. Your line is open. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Hey guys, thanks for taking the question here. I just wanted to come back to the consumption growth being slightly better than expectations again for the second quarter in a row now. And apologies if I missed it, but this improvement that we're seeing, is this across all vintages and geographies or is it potentially more concentrated in scope? Just trying to get a better understanding of what's seeking place out there and what's embedded in the guide. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. No, I would describe it as broad-based, Mike. And obviously, we're pleased to see it and we're continuing monitoring and slicing and dicing it in different ways. And as we have information or insights to you, we'll share it. And without trying to throw a whole bunch of cold water on our mind, it was slightly better, or a step-function changed better, but good to see. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Terrific. And maybe for a quick follow-up for Dev. I think it builds off maybe Tyler's question at the top of the Q&A, but you had cited that some customers are thinking about their workloads more holistically and even looking to run AI workloads on-prem. How much of that do you think is just a function of customers are still trying to figure out how to optimize for latency and cost or is this more a demonstration of we really are in the early phases of the exploratory phase versus going into production? Is there any way to coarse that out or is the two not necessarily connected? Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer No, I think it's kind of a little bit of both. I think you have some customers who are very committed to running a big part of the estate on-prem. So by definition, then if they're going to build an AI workload, it has to be run on-prem, which means that they also need access to GPUs and they're doing that. And then other customers are leveraging basically renting GPUs from the cloud providers and building their own AI workloads. I do think we're in the very, very early days. They're still learning, experimenting. More-and-more apps are entering production. And as I said on the prepared remarks, we have thousands of workload -- AI workloads running on MongoDB, but a very small percentage of them have demonstrated meaningful product market fit. And so the initial traction is kind of still small. But I think as people get more sophisticated with AI, as the AI technology matures and becomes more and more useful, I think applications will -- you'll start seeing these applications take-off. I kind of chuckled that today I see more senior leaders bragging about the chips they're using versus the apps they're building. So it just tells you that we're still in the very, very early days of this big platform shift. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Great point. Thank you again, guys. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Mike. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Eric Heath of KeyBanc. Your line is open. Eric Heath -- Analyst Hi, thanks for taking the question. Dev, Michael, it sounds like the takeaway from the call is a greater focus on EA and on enterprise. So should we structurally rethink the EA business differently and think of this more as a healthy double-digit growth business going forward for the foreseeable future? And then if I could just ask a follow-up question separate to that. But Michael, I understand that it's still early to identify the fiscal '25 cohort of workloads, but just curious at a high-level if they look and feel like of higher quality than the fiscal '24 cohort of workflow. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Do you want to take on the first one in terms of EA... Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, I mean, I would say, I mean, we are very committed to our run anywhere strategy. And as I said, we are first investing in community where for many customers is the first way they experience MongoDB. And we want them to have the full experience of integrating search and Vector search into our core product. And so they can out of the gate really start building applications. That will then transition to building those capabilities into EA. So, we are clearly investing in the EA product. But Atlas is still a big, big part of our business and a big, big part of our growth engine and we typically launch new features on Atlas and because of the capabilities we already have, the fact it's multi-cloud makes it a very, very compelling offering for many customers. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. And I think in terms of the workloads, I do think it's early. Just as a reminder for folks, they tend to start small, although grow quickly. I think the only other thing that I can add is, we've been pretty consistent and that we've been pleased with the new business that we've done. But we need some time to let the cohorts play out as we track them. But I think like I said, we've been happy with the new business that we were winning. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of William Power of Baird. Your line is open. Brian Raferty Denyeau -- Investor Relations You there, William? William Power -- Analyst Sorry, yeah. Thank you. Dev, you had some encouraging comments on relational migrator. I wonder if you could just touch on what you think is driving the higher interest here. I mean, it sounds like AI is contributing and helping, but it'd be great to get some more color there because that still feels like obviously a meaningful long-term opportunity. And then maybe the second part of the question for Dev or Michael, just be great to get any other framework around the professional services investments. Any way to kind of think about quantification and timing of that? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So the reason we're so excited about the opportunity to go after legacy applications is that, one, it seems like there's a confluence of events happening. One is that the increasing cost and tax of supporting and managing these legacy apps are just going up enough. Second, for many customers who are in regulated industries, the regulators are calling their -- the fact that they're running on these legacy apps with systemic risk, so they can no longer kick the can down the road. Third, also because they no longer can kick the can around, some vendors are going end-of-life, so they have to make a decision to migrate those applications to a more modern tech stack. Fourth, because GenAI is so predicated on data and to build a competitive advantage, you need to leverage your proprietary data, people want to access that data and be able to do so easily. And so that's another reason for them to want to modernize. And then you also have people who built those applications who are retiring or just no longer in the firm, so it just creates more and more risk for the companies. Given all that, customers are incredibly interested in figuring out a way to easily and safely and securely migrate those -- off those applications. And we always could help them very easily move the data and map the schema from a relational schema to a document schema. The hardest part was essentially rewriting the application. Now with the advent of GenAI, you can now significantly reduce the time. One, you can use GenAI to analyze existing code. Two, you can use GenAI to reverse engineer tests to test what the code does. And then three, you can use GenAI to build new code and then users test it to ensure that the new code produces the same results as the old code. And so all that time and effort is suddenly cut in a meaningful way and that's suddenly creating a lot of interest from customers saying, my goodness. And if you're already on a relational app, moving to another relational app doesn't feel like modernization. So, the other advantage is that moving to MongoDB gives them a much more modern platform, a much more agile, flexible, performant, and scalable platform for their future needs. And that's why we're so excited. Again, it's early days. We've run a number of pilots that have gone well. We're in the process of working with some customers now in the migration process. This will take time because these are very, very complex applications. And actually, one thing I also mentioned was that they're not just going after -- saying go after some tertiary Tier 2 or Tier 3 application, they're saying, hey, we want you to look at some of our crown jewels because these are the apps that are most painful for us. So that's also very exciting. But again, this will take time, but we're very committed to this, and we think this is going to drive -- help us drive long-term -- meaningful long-term growth. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, Will. And to the last part of your question on the professional services investment, we're really building out that capacity in order to meet the demand that we're seeing relative to the opportunity. We're calling it in particular because it has a gross margin impact because that's where that will typically show up. And then maybe the last thing and it's probably obvious, but just to sort of underscore it is the reason we're doing this though is for the ARR, right, to drive the new workloads, the additional workloads over to MongoDB as part of that migration. And over time, as we've talked about before, we hope and expect to be able to leverage technology more and more, but at least initially and into the medium-term, there's going to be a healthy human/services component to that. Just wanted to sort of effectively telegraph that out to folks. William Power -- Analyst That's helpful. Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Will. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Rudy Kessinger of DA Davidson. Please go ahead. Rudy Kessinger -- Analyst Hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in here. I believe last quarter you said consumption growth slightly ahead of expectations. And while down slower year-over-year growth versus Q2 last year, the year-over-year growth did improve from Q1. And so, I guess I'm curious for Q3, could you make a comment in that same regard? Obviously, slower on a year-over-year basis than Q3 last year, but was it stable with year-over-year consumption growth in Q2 or better or worse? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Rudy, thanks for the question. We haven't specifically called that out relative to Q2. We did see a lower year-over-year growth as we called out. We did see a seasonal rebound. Usually Q3 is stronger than Q2 and we talked about how that was smaller than in the prior year. So hopefully, that will help you all triangulate. Rudy Kessinger -- Analyst Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. I believe it was on your Q4 call back in March. At that point, Dev, you said it would be at least another year until AI applications are being deployed at scale. It sounds like the commentary that some early large workloads, but out of the thousands, just not many that are at large scale. I guess, is your expectation now that maybe it's still at least another year until we're seeing broad AI application rollouts at scale? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I think a lot of it's a function of the what's happening in the R&D side of AI, right? So for example, today, we don't have a very compelling model designed for our phones, right, because today the phones don't have the computing horsepower to run complex models. So, you don't see a ton of very, very successful consumer apps besides, say, ChatGPT or Claude. So we don't -- we also don't see like hundreds of apps taking off like you saw kind of the first generation of like the Internet or the cloud era, right, or the mobile era. So like I think we're still in the early days of AI. And so while we see a lot of people building AI apps, a lot of them have kind of fairly rudimentary functionality. But I think that over time that's going to change. In fact, I know it will change. I just can't predict when that will happen. But where we do see apps having production, we are having traction, we're seeing them grow very, very quickly and we have a lot of them on our platform. It's just very few of them are really have meaningful. Operator Thank you. And that concludes today's Q&A session. I would like to go ahead and turn the call back over to Dev for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, everyone. I just wanted to say we're really pleased with our Q3 results with strong new business performance and revenue exceeding expectations both -- across both Atlas and EA. We're making the necessary investments to expand our enterprise channel where we see the largest opportunity to establish MongoDB as a standard and the strongest returns on our go-to-market investments. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the progress we're making on both accelerating legacy app modernization with AI as well as establishing ourselves as a standard of the emerging AI tech stack for greenfield AI applications. And last but not least, I would like to thank Michael again for his contributions over the past 10 years and wish him well. Thank you, everyone, and we'll talk to you soon.

let's begin reviewing third quarter result giving broader company update. generated revenue $529 million, 22% year-over-year increase high end guidance. atlas revenue grew 26% year-over-year, representing 68% total revenue. generated non-gaap operating income $101 million 19% non-gaap operating margin ended quarter 52,600 customers. overall, pleased performance third quarter. strong new business quarter happy new workload acquisition atlas. non-atlas business significantly exceeded expectation part benefited large multi-year deal customer continue value run anywhere strategy want build deeper longer-term relationship mongodb. atlas consumption slightly better expected macro-environment would characterize largely consistent saw first half year. michael cover consumption trend detail. retention rate remained strong q3, demonstrating mission criticality platform. q1 earnings call, shared three major strategic initiative believe enable u maximize long-term opportunity. want give update progress making initiatives. first, increasing investment enterprise channel since see strongest return part market. specifically, expanding strategic account program going next year, see account benefit incremental investment. addition, investing time resource educate developer large enterprise account uplevel mongodb skills. organization thousand developer penetrate deeply, encounter developer historically built sql application simply know use mongodb full potential. experience, educating developer benefit mongodb drive significant incremental adoption platform. fund up-market investments, reallocating portion mid-market investments. mid-market remains attractive opportunity us, believe prioritizing investment up-market deliver strong return current environment. also believe additional way serve mid-market efficiently self-serve channel scaled technology-enabled sale customer service motions. second, optimistic opportunity accelerate legacy app modernization using ai investing area. recall, ran successful pilot earlier year, demonstrating ai tooling combined professional service relational migrator product significantly reduce time, cost, risk migrating legacy application onto mongodb. early days, observed 50% reduction cost modernize. back strong early results, additional customer interest exceeding expectations. large enterprise every industry geography experiencing acute pain legacy infrastructure eager agile, performant, cost-effective solutions. customer excited engage us, also want focus important application enterprise, demonstrating level interest size long-term opportunity. relational application encompass wide variety database types, programming languages, versions, customer-specific variables, expect modernization project continue include meaningful service engagement short medium term. consequently, increasing professional service delivery capabilities, directly partners. long run, expect automate simplify large part modernization process. end, leveraging learning early service engagement develop new tool accelerate future modernization efforts. although early day scaling legacy app modernization capability take time, increased conviction motion significantly add growth long term. third, investing capitalize inherent technical advantage key component emerging ai tech stack. reminder, mongodb uniquely equipped query rich complex data structure typical ai applications. ability database query rich complex data structure crucial ai application often rely highly detailed, interrelated, nuanced data make accurate prediction decisions. example, recommendation system analyze single customer's purchase also considers browsing history, peer group behavior, product category requiring database query interlink complex data structures. addition, mongodb's architecture unifies source data, metadata, operational data, vector data all-in-one platform, updating need multiple database system complex back-end architectures. enables compelling developer experience alternative. see ai market today, customer still experimental stage work understand effectiveness underlying tech stack build early proof-of-concept applications. however, seeing increasing number ai apps production. today, thousand ai apps platform. yet see many apps actually achieving meaningful product market fit therefore significant traction. fact, take step back look entire universe ai apps, small percentage achieved type scale commonly see enterprise-specific applications. ai apps growing quickly, including one already seven-figure workload grown 10 time since beginning year. similar prior platform shift usefulness ai tech improves becomes cost-effective, see emergence many ai apps nail product market fit, difficult predict happen broadly. remain confident capture fair share successful ai application see platform popular developer building sophisticated ai use cases. continue investing product capabilities, including enterprise-grade atlas vector search functionality build momentum even better position mongodb capture ai opportunity. addition, previously announced, bringing search vector service community ea offerings, leveraging run anywhere competitive advantage world ai. finally, expanding mongodb ai application program maap, help enterprise customer build bring ai application production providing reference architectures, integration leading tech providers, coordinated service support. last week, announced new code partner including mckinsey, confluent, capgemini, unstructured, well collaboration meta enable developer build ai-enriched application mongodb using llama. next, like provide brief product update. dot local developer conference london october, announced general availability mongodb 8.0, fastest performant version mongodb ever. mongodb 8.0 performs 20% 60% better common industry benchmark compared prior version built exceed customers' stringent security, resiliency, availability, performance requirements. best serve customers, regularly review reprioritize investment product portfolio ensure allocating resource product highest demand customers. that, also deprecate product showing result desired. consequently, made decision consolidate atlas serverless offering smallest dedicated tier create atlas flex customers, new offering simpler architecture provides elasticity feature akin serverless. begin migrating effective customer single, simple, entry-level solution q4. also decided deprecate atlas devicesync capability widely adopted order focus engineering resource core platform. reprioritization decision made lightly, allow u deliver value largest number customers, reinforcing commitment best modern database helping u grow faster. now, like spend minute reviewing adoption trend mongodb across customer base. customer across industry around world running mission-critical project mongodb atlas, leveraging full power developer data platform, including financial times, cargurus, victoria's secret. part digital transformation journey, global specialty retailer victoria's secret & company migrated e-commerce platform mongodb atlas. fully managed platform, mongodb atlas allowed company simplify architecture improve performance, supporting retailer provide resilient, secure, fast web mobile e-commerce experience million customer around world. allianz, alphamad, swiss post, paylocity turning mongodb modernize applications. paylocity, leading provider cloud-based payroll human capital management software, selected mongodb power proprietary application aimed fostering employee connection engagement. traffic increased original sql-based solution unable keep required performance metrics, paylocity migrated mongodb atlas take advantage flexible schema architecture, performance, scalability. mongodb cost five time less previous sql database solution company's developer create application within minutes, something used take weeks. mature company start-ups alike using mongodb help deliver next wave ai-powered application customers, including nerdwallet, cisco, tealbook. tealbook, supplier intelligence platform, migrated postgres, pgvector, elasticsearch mongodb eliminate technical debt consolidate tech stack. company experienced workload isolation scalability issue pgvector concerned search index inconsistencies, resolved migration mongodb. atlas vector search dedicated search nodes, tealbook realized improved cost-efficiency increased scalability supplier data platform, application us genai collect, verify, enrich supplier data across various sources. summary, healthy q3 atlas ea exceeding expectations. saw strong new business quarter remain confident ability become increasing strategic provider large growing market. looking forward, see great opportunity grow adoption enterprise new workloads, modernizing legacy applications, winning next generation ai-powered applications. would like finish providing update senior leadership. first, announced early press release, nearly 10 years, michael gordon made decision leave mongodb. michael instrumental mongodb's success past decade, leading successful ipo, helping u grow revenue nearly 50-fold, scaling -- successfully scaling business model generate meaningful operating leverage. trusted advisor business partner board year also become personal friend. michael excited take well-deserved break. commenced search michael's replacement evaluating internal external candidates. one michael's proudest compliment -- accomplishment building world-class finance team leadership, confident miss beat transition. michael continue serve cfo january 31st help u finish fiscal year transition advisor company ensure seamless process. named michael's successor fiscal year-end, serge tanjga, svp finance, serve interim cfo, beginning february 1st. second, promoting cedric pech, currently chief revenue officer newly created role president worldwide field operations. new position, cedric oversee field-based customer-facing go-to-market enablement teams, including professional services. believe org structure best enable u execute key strategic initiative discussed earlier, particular, increased focus up-market app monetization opportunity. would like congratulate cedric well-deserved promotion. that, let turn call michael. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer thanks, dev, thanks kind word incredible partnership past decade. past 10 year rewarding professional career extremely proud achieved together course, whole mongodb team. much success had, still believe mongodb early stage realizing full potential continues take share one largest market software. now, turning result quarter. begin detailed review third-quarter result finish outlook fourth quarter full fiscal year 2025. first, start third quarter results. total revenue quarter $529.4 million, 22% year-over-year high end guidance. shifting product mix, atlas grew 26% quarter compared previous year represents 68% total revenue compared 66% third quarter fiscal 2024 71% last quarter. recognized atlas revenue primarily based customer consumption platform consumption closely tied end user activity applications. let provide context atlas consumption quarter. q3, consumption slightly ahead expectations. year's q3 seasonal improvement muted year past expected. year-over-year basis, consumption growth remains prior year period. turning non-atlas revenue. non-atlas came significantly ahead expectations. dev mentioned, ea new business strong, continue success selling incremental workload existing customer base. addition, q3 non-atlas revenue benefited large multi-year deals. know, due asc 606, recognized entire term license component multi-year contract start contract. compared q3 last year, multi-year license component non-atlas revenue $15 million higher. turning customer growth. third quarter, grew customer base approximately 1,900 customer sequentially, bringing total customer count 52,600, 46,400 year-ago period. total customer count, 7,400 direct sale customers, compare 6,900 year-ago period. growth total customer count driven primarily atlas, 51,100 customer end quarter compared 44,900 year-ago period. important keep mind growth atlas customer count reflects new customer mongodb addition existing ea customer adding first atlas workload. continuing on, q3, net arr expansion rate approximately 120%. ended quarter 2,314 customer least $100,000 arr annualized mrr, $1,972 year-ago period. moving income statement, discussing result non-gaap basis unless otherwise noted. gross profit third quarter $405.7 million, representing gross margin 77%, flat versus year-ago period. income operation $101.5 million 19% operating margin third quarter compared 18% operating margin year-ago period. primary reason favorable operating income result versus guidance revenue outperformance, including high margin multi-year license revenue benefit. net income third quarter $98.1 million $1.16 per share, based 84.2 million diluted weighted average share outstanding. compare net income $79.1 million $0.96 per share 83.7 million diluted weighted-average share outstanding year-ago period. turning balance sheet cash flow, ended third quarter $2.3 billion cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash. operating cash flow third quarter $37.4 million. taking consideration approximately $2.9 million capital expenditure principal repayment finance lease liabilities, free cash flow $34.6 million quarter. compare free cash flow $35 million year-ago period. q3, incur capital expenditure purchase ipv4 address previously expected, start making purchase november still expect total outlay $20 million $25 million fiscal year previously communicated. like turn outlook fourth quarter full fiscal year 2025. fourth quarter, expect revenue range $515 million $519 million. expect non-gaap income operation range $55 million $58 million non-gaap net income per share range $0.62 $0.65 based 84.9 million estimated diluted weighted-average share outstanding. full-fiscal year 2025, expect revenue range $1.973 billion $1.977 billion, non-gaap income operation range $242 million $245 million, non-gaap net income per share range $3.01 $3.03 based 84 million estimated diluted weighted-average share outstanding. note non-gaap net income per share guidance fourth-quarter full-fiscal year 2025 includes non-gaap tax provision approximately 20%. provide context around updated guidance. first, term atlas consumption, expect see typical seasonal slowdown q4, driven underlying application usage moderating holiday season. second, since atlas consumption remained lower year-over-year basis q3, expect see continued deceleration atlas year-over-year growth q4. third, expect see sequential decline non-atlas revenue q4, contrary normal pattern. reason experienced significant additional benefit multi-year deal q3, expect recur q4. addition, want provide incremental color recent product -- recent product go-to-market change impact growth reported customer count going forward. first, dev explained, reallocating portion go-to-market resource mid-market enterprise channel. result, expect see significantly fewer mid-market direct sale customer net addition result, slower direct sale customer growth going forward. believe reallocation investment dollar drive higher revenue growth time. so, trade-off make sense. second, introduce atlas flex cluster q4 automatically migrate customer q1, expect see one-time negative impact customer count since approximately 4,000 serverless customer low spending expect transition flex. customer negligible impact revenue impact reported customer count. summarize, pleased third quarter result especially ability win new business. small share one largest fastest-growing market software number secular tailwinds, including ai back. continue investing judiciously focusing execution capture long-term opportunity. that, like open questions. operator? question & answers: operator [operator instructions] first question day coming sanjit singh morgan stanley. line open. sanjit singh -- analyst thank taking question congrats, michael, outstanding career. absolutely fantastic run mongodb. excited see next, excited take breather. congrats, michael. guess take question -- start questions, look atlas past two quarters, correct wrong, think consumption coming least modestly ahead expectations. relative seen beginning year, sort -- function sale execution? function end-user activity sort improving? what's driving least improvement atlas consumption past two quarters? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. different things. think look outlook beginning year, indicated thought would see stable atlas growth consumption standpoint. seen talked -- actually seen lower year-over-year growth based underlying consumption. -- that's incorporated q4 guide. seen q3 q4 -- sorry, q2 q3, excuse me, better expectations, still year-over-year basis. want make sure sort confusing comparative set year-over-year versus relative expectations. sanjit singh -- analyst understood. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer core it, sanjit, question really underlying usage applications. sanjit singh -- analyst yeah, make total sense. then, dev, ask ai agent question. term ai agent needing context, going set tool take actions. mean mongodb operational data store customer start roll agentic applications? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. so, talk agents, think think agents, there's jobs, there's -- sorry, there's job, there's project there's task. right now, agent rolled really focused task like say something sierra company rolling agents. right, deemed deal able create rich complex data structures. important ai ai model look isolated data points, need understand relationships, hierarchies, pattern within data. need able essentially get real-time insights. example, chatbot someone querying, customer kind trying get update order placed five minute ago may gotten confirmation, chatbot need able deal real-time information. need able deal basically handling advanced use cases, understanding like, thing like fraud detection understand behavior supply chains, need understand intricate data relationships. thing consistent mongodb offers. believe end day, well-positioned handle this. thing would say embedded natural way search vector search. oltp database, tech search vector search. that's one experience platform offer that, think real advantage. integrated leading ai framework platforms. enterprise-grade security compliance, customer run u anywhere, either 118 cloud region on-prem, huge differentiator us. sanjit singh -- analyst awesome. appreciate thoughts, dev. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, sanjit. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line taylor -- tyler radke citi. line open. tyler radke -- analyst hi, thank much taking question. and, michael, best, congratulation 10 years. going back sale execution, mean, one thing talked earlier year challenge term recently acquired workload ramping. think lot past fiscal year. curious quality workload acquisition trended year. think ramp consumption potential next year, sort look versus time year ago? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. maybe talk change made michael talk little bit consumption trends. so, make change beginning year, really wanted focus volume quality workload slight adjustment made. think change reasonable positive impact. again, early declare victory workload usually start small grow time, really pleased result seeing far. -- again, early days. obviously, know fiscal '25 workload go fiscal '26. far, good. michael, consumption? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, couple things, thanks, tyler. fiscal '24 cohort called earlier, slower growth continue. line revised expectations. made change talked -- earlier year affect fiscal '25 cohorts, early tell. those, need quarter data really see -- seeing behave differently. say talked new business environment success new business. pleased that, show kind initial piece, need see grow cohort evolve. tyler radke -- analyst great. thanks. follow-up ea side, talked outsized strength non-atlas business quarter. maybe could unpack like relative upside driven simply duration versus new business. know called duration impact year-over-year, -- feel like sort one-off feel like maybe bigger customer indexing toward ea impact way think product introducing thing like vector search stream processing onto on-prem product? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah, thank you. overall, continue find ea product resonate customers. important part run anywhere strategy continued see success people wanting increase investment mongodb. there's always multiyear component continue see that. talked beginning year fiscal '24 abnormally high amount multi-year benefit therefore, anticipating headwind quantified roughly $40 million range. talked call earlier saw large accounts, surprising amount multiyear positively benefited q3 little $15 million revenue compared saw q3 year ago. so, much headwind expecting. obviously, 606 dynamics, things, especially large deal kind meaty chunky lumpy, try call sort help people understand, there's pretty healthy kind baseline flow, ea, also multiyear. see spikes, try call you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. want add, tyler, investing call ea business. first, starting investing search vector search community product. couple thing us. one, whenever anyone start mongodb open-source product, immediately get benefit complete highly integrated platform. two, capability migrate ea. so, ea u investment strategy. definitely see lot large customer very, committed running workload on-prem. even see customer want run run ai workload on-prem. so, optionality get using mongodb on-prem cloud, also cross-cloud compelling one. tyler radke -- analyst thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line brad reback stifel. line open. brad reback -- analyst great. thanks much. and, michael, best luck. great run. dev, started call talking bunch investments, great given growth business. obviously, talked reallocating expenses. net-net, think incremental investment phase next year gating margin upside? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer think that's something obviously ready talk next year now, would say -- reason looking invest summarize again, going up-market legacy app modernization see large workload potentially play ideal database genai apps, future important investment drive long-term growth. quite energized investment that's something high conviction on. brad reback -- analyst that's great. maap program, workload going wind atlas healthy combination ea atlas? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer think early days. would say -- would probably say side atlas ea early days. think introduce search vector search ea product, see on-prem. obviously, people use mongodb ai workload using technology well conjunction mongodb on-prem ai use cases. would say probably going see happen first atlas. brad reback -- analyst great. thanks much. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line jason ader william blair. line open. jason ader -- analyst yeah, thank you. going belabor congratulating michael, fun working best luck. question strength ea. think, dev, represents comment enterprise might rethinking reassessing kind on-prem versus cloud workload placement decision? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer well, think large enterprises, think large enterprise meaningful workload still running on-prem. think belief everything would go cloud probably something really popular good old day zurp. think customer assess investment already place, much judicious run workload think leverage existing investment infrastructure, going so. also bunch reason like regulatory reasons, customer quite moving aggressively cloud. see particularly europe, see lot european bank still running majority workload on-prem. also varies region conversely asia, seeing people much move much aggressively cloud. think really depends industry, geography, personal dynamic what's happening particular account. mean, see large u bank also committed running thing on-prem. really varies. that's feel really good run anywhere strategy give customer optionality. build something run on-prem. choose move cloud, easy mongodb. jason ader -- analyst right. follow-up also investment making strategic sale enterprise. could get little specific investment might be? hiring lot new salespeople? working sis, investing sis? additional detail would helpful. thanks. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. everyone's benefit, identified number accounts, call strategic accounts, think high upside us. seen number account grow quickly deploy right mix resources. necessarily quota-carrying resources. could additional technical sale resources, additional p resources, additional customer service resource better service support accounts. even thing like run education session developer accounts, called either hackathons like call developer day even design review meet development team looking build application, help think would potentially use mongodb build particular app. find many developers, experience mongodb quite limited, engage them, educate show simple easy is. like example, customer today think like use oltp database, search database, maybe vector database, like caching database. integrated mongodb. sudden, customer say, wow, simplify life, simplify back-end infrastructure, build app far quickly much easier manage long-term everything mongodb. really function educating power mongodb really open lot opportunity us. that's doubling down, mix resource really predicated accounts, quota counting resources, whole suite resource bringing table. jason ader -- analyst thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line andrew nowinski well fargo. line open. andrew nowinski -- analyst okay. good afternoon. thank much taking question congrats nice quarter. gave example customer migrated postgres think said issue pg vector function. wondering long customer using postgres decided make change mongo, meaning sort like rebound type customer chose pg -- excuse me, postgres work? frequently seeing type transition? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. can't give specific long using postgres, -- trend seeing business. remember postgres 40-year-old technology. -- beneficiary people lifting shifting type relational databases, oracle, sql server, mysql, et cetera. open-source database. part -- open-source relational database, inherent challenge relational database do. quite inflexible. build schema, hard change schema. hard scale hard distribute data. large data volumes, weird thing like, example, resort off-road storage large data objects, creates performance bottlenecks. again, people default postgres know anything better know relational everyone kind moving relational platforms. that's whole point saying earlier. educate developer flexibility schema, easily horizontally scale rich query language aggregation sophisticated geospatial indexes, productivity gain using document model easy organize data, -- people like, wow, life much easier. want clear, zero-sum game. postgres fail u successful. big market quite excited opportunity, see customer moving postgres coming mongodb. andrew nowinski -- analyst thank you. helpful. maybe quick follow-up. normalize $15 million multiyear deal impact q3, would ea still sequentially q4? thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer given level guidance, trying help understand context full-year number headwind talked beginning year, given strength saw q3. andrew nowinski -- analyst got it. thanks. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line raimo lenschow barclays. line open. raimo lenschow -- analyst hey, thank you. think ea strength quarter, michael, kind give u little bit there. like think renewal -- renewal situation renewal pool coming like q3, coming q4, et cetera, well like mean term upsell, cross-sell opportunity people think starting ai project self-serve, kind mentioned earlier call? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. think -- think ea q4, tends large renewal quarter, talking term guide strength multiyear, that's would expect see ea sequentially, typically pattern, called out. term ai workload things, think early tell obviously, continue evolve assess view get full-year guide march. also updated view cohort behaving sort multiyear played out. think term q4, comment made earlier hopefully help. raimo lenschow -- analyst yeah. okay, perfect. -- talk little bit like obviously, there's debate like database persistent layer ai projects, et cetera. see big hyperscalers term working guy partnerships? obviously aws kind summit, et-cetera. speak little bit like relationship big guy evolving around this? michael, best case talk you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. so, start partnership first, like -- aws, said, re:invent show last week. -- remains very, strong. closed ton deal past quarter. very, large deals. integration new product like q bedrock engagement field really strong. azure, think -- shared past, start-off little bit slow start, word person run partner leadership, azure mongodb relationship never stronger. closed large number deals. part what's called azure native ic service program bunch deep integration azure, including fabric, power bi, visual studio, semantic kernel, azure openai studio. also one azure's largest marketplace partners. gcp -- actually seen uptick term co-sales done past quarter gcp made comp change -- favorable working mongodb saw result field, focused closing -- closing handful large deal gcp q4. general, would say, thing going quite well. term of, guess, implying question like hyperscalers potentially bundling thing along ai offerings? mean, candidly, since day one, hyperscalers bundling database offering every offering that's predominant strategy. -- think executed well strategy database like by-the-way decision. important decision. think hyperscalers seeing performance realize better partner us. said, customer understand importance data layer, especially ai applications. partnership across three hyperscalers strong. raimo lenschow -- analyst ok, perfect. thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer thanks, raimo. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line brad sill bank america. line open. brad sill -- analyst great. thank much, congratulations, michael, next move. wanted ask new workload vector search, stream processing, relational migrator. one three that's ramping faster maybe expected? little bit color new workload type ramping. thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. kind give rundown -- mean, essentially asking new products, like -- search, introduced new capability called atlas search nodes, asymmetrically scale search node search-intensive use case, scale node become quite expensive. seen kind groundbreaking capability really well received. demand quite high customer like tune configuration unique need search requirements. one world's largest bank using atlas search provide like google-like search experience payment data massive corporate customers. customer-facing application performance, scalability critical. leading provider ai-powered accounting software us atlas search power invoice analytics future, allows end user finance team perform ad-hoc analysis easily find past-due invoice voice contain errors. search -- vector search, -- again, kind first full-year since going generally available. product uptake actually very, high. q3, released quantization atlas vector search, reduces memory requirement 96%, allowing u support larger vector workload vastly improved price performance. example, multinational news organization created genai powered tool designed help producer journalist efficiently search, summarize, verify information vast varied data sources. leading security firm using atlas vector search fight ai fraud leading global medium company replaced elastic search hybrid search vector search use case user recommendation engine that's built suggest -- that's built suggest article end users. that's super exciting see well. also seeing lot interest streaming product, demand high. rolled another hyperscaler, customer commenting use case able embed stream processing mongodb make life much easier. overall, quite pleased progress making new products. said before, natively bundling capability really reduces eliminates need customer bolt bunch different technology solve problem, saving lot time, money, cost, risk. brad sill -- analyst that's really exciting. thanks, dev. wanted ask question around cedric's appointment. focus may different leadership thinking going forward? thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer no, cedric cro for, gosh, like think like five, six years, -- interim cro three quarter took last made change really expansion responsibilities. known cedric long time. worked multiple different companies. think good barometer understanding sale leadership. there's number sale leader worked top-tier software company used work me. super-excited role cedric going take also making change cedric better align different organization tightly work together going up-market, app monetization positioning well ideal database genai apps. brad sill -- analyst super exciting. thanks, dev. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer thanks, brad. operator thank you. one moment next question, please. next question coming line mike cikos needham company. line open. mike cikos -- analyst hey guys, thanks taking question here. wanted come back consumption growth slightly better expectation second quarter row now. apology missed it, improvement seeing, across vintage geography potentially concentrated scope? trying get better understanding what's seeking place what's embedded guide. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. no, would describe broad-based, mike. obviously, pleased see continuing monitoring slicing dicing different ways. information insight you, share it. without trying throw whole bunch cold water mind, slightly better, step-function changed better, good see. mike cikos -- analyst terrific. maybe quick follow-up dev. think build maybe tyler's question top q&a, cited customer thinking workload holistically even looking run ai workload on-prem. much think function customer still trying figure optimize latency cost demonstration really early phase exploratory phase versus going production? way coarse two necessarily connected? thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer no, think kind little bit both. think customer committed running big part estate on-prem. definition, going build ai workload, run on-prem, mean also

Welcome to the MongoDB third-quarter fiscal year 2025 conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there'll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your speaker for today, Brian Denyeau. Please go ahead. Brian Raferty Denyeau -- Investor Relations Thank you, Lisa. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today to review MongoDB's third-quarter fiscal 2025 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued after the close of the market today. Joining me the call today are Dev Ittycheria, president and CEO of MongoDB; and Michael Gordon, MongoDB's COO and CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our market and future growth opportunities, our expectations for the macroeconomic environment in fiscal 2025 and the impact of AI, the benefits of our product platform, our competitive landscape, customer behaviors, our financial guidance, and our planned investments in growth opportunities in AI. These statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including the results of operations and financial condition that cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. For a discussion of the material risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please refer to the risks described in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 31st, 2024 that we filed with the SEC on August 30th, 2024. Any forward-looking statements made on this call reflect our views only as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them except as required by law. Additionally, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures on this conference call. Please refer to the tables in our earnings release in the Investor Relations portion of our website for a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dev. Dev? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we had a strong quarter of new business and executed well against our large market opportunity. Let's begin by reviewing our third quarter results before giving you a broader company update. We generated revenue of $529 million, a 22% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew 26% year-over-year, representing 68% of total revenue. We generated non-GAAP operating income of $101 million for a 19% non-GAAP operating margin and we ended the quarter with over 52,600 customers. Overall, we were pleased with our performance in the third quarter. We had a strong new business quarter and we're happy with our new workload acquisition on Atlas. Our non-Atlas business significantly exceeded expectations in part because we benefited from a few large multi-year deals as customers continue to value our run anywhere strategy and want to build a deeper longer-term relationship with MongoDB. Atlas consumption was slightly better than expected in a macro-environment that we would characterize as largely consistent with what we saw in the first half of the year. Michael will cover consumption trends in more detail. Retention rates remained strong in Q3, demonstrating the mission criticality of our platform. On our Q1 earnings call, we shared with you the three major strategic initiatives that we believe will enable us to maximize our long-term opportunity. I want to give you an update on the progress we're making on those initiatives. First, we are increasing our investment in the enterprise channel since we see the strongest returns in this part of the market. Specifically, we're expanding our strategic account program going to next year, as we see more accounts that will benefit from incremental investment. In addition, we're investing time and resources to educate developers in large enterprise accounts and uplevel their MongoDB skills. These organizations have thousands of developers and as we penetrate them more deeply, we encounter developers who have historically only built SQL applications and simply do not know how to use MongoDB to its full potential. In our experience, educating these developers on the benefits of MongoDB drives significant incremental adoption of our platform. To fund these up-market investments, we are reallocating a portion of our mid-market investments. The mid-market remains an attractive opportunity for us, but we believe that prioritizing investment up-market will deliver strong returns in the current environment. We also believe there are additional ways to serve the mid-market more efficiently through our self-serve channel and other scaled technology-enabled sales and customer service motions. Second, we are optimistic about the opportunity to accelerate legacy app modernization using AI and are investing more in this area. As you recall, we ran a few successful pilots earlier this year, demonstrating that AI tooling combined with professional services and our relational migrator product can significantly reduce the time, cost, and risk of migrating legacy applications onto MongoDB. While it's early days, we have observed a more than 50% reduction in the cost to modernize. On the back of these strong early results, additional customer interest is exceeding our expectations. Large enterprises in every industry and geography are experiencing acute pain from their legacy infrastructure and are eager for more agile, performant, and cost-effective solutions. Not only are customers excited to engage with us, they also want to focus on some of the most important applications in their enterprise, further demonstrating the level of interest and size of the long-term opportunity. As relational applications encompass a wide variety of database types, programming languages, versions, and other customer-specific variables, we expect modernization projects to continue to include meaningful service engagements in the short and medium term. Consequently, we're increasing our professional services delivery capabilities, both directly and through partners. In the long run, we expect to automate and simplify large parts of the modernization process. To that end, we are leveraging the learnings from early service engagement to develop new tools to accelerate future modernization efforts. Although it's early days and scaling our legacy app modernization capabilities will take time, we have increased conviction that this motion will significantly add to our growth in the long term. Third, we are investing to capitalize on our inherent technical advantages as a key component of the emerging AI tech stack. As a reminder, MongoDB is uniquely equipped to query rich and complex data structures typical of AI applications. The ability of a database to query rich and complex data structures is crucial because AI applications often rely on highly detailed, interrelated, and nuanced data to make accurate predictions and decisions. For example, a recommendation system doesn't just analyze a single customer's purchase but also considers their browsing history, peer group behavior, and product categories requiring a database that can query and interlink these complex data structures. In addition, MongoDB's architecture unifies source data, metadata, operational data, and vector data in an all-in-one platform, updating the need for multiple database systems and complex back-end architectures. This enables a more compelling developer experience than any other alternative. From what we see in the AI market today, most customers are still in the experimental stage as they work to understand the effectiveness of the underlying tech stack and build early proof-of-concept applications. However, we are seeing an increasing number of AI apps in production. Today, we have thousands of AI apps on our platform. What we don't yet see is many of these apps actually achieving meaningful product market fit and therefore significant traction. In fact, as you take a step back and look at the entire universe of AI apps, a very small percentage of them have achieved the type of scale that we commonly see with enterprise-specific applications. We do have some AI apps that are growing quickly, including one that is already a seven-figure workload that has grown 10 times since the beginning of the year. Similar to prior platform shifts as the usefulness of AI tech improves and becomes more cost-effective, we will see the emergence of many more AI apps that do nail product market fit, but it's difficult to predict when that will happen more broadly. We remain confident that we will capture our fair share of these successful AI applications as we see that our platform is popular with developers building more sophisticated AI use cases. We continue investing in our product capabilities, including enterprise-grade Atlas Vector Search functionality to build on this momentum and even better position MongoDB to capture the AI opportunity. In addition, as previously announced, we are bringing search and vector service to our community and EA offerings, leveraging our run anywhere competitive advantage in the world of AI. Finally, we are expanding our MongoDB AI applications program or MAAP, which helps enterprise customers build and bring AI applications into production by providing them with reference architectures, integrations with leading tech providers, and coordinated services and support. Last week, we announced a new code of partners including McKinsey, Confluent, Capgemini, and Unstructured, as well as the collaboration with Meta to enable developers to build AI-enriched applications on MongoDB using Llama. Next, I'd like to provide you with a brief product update. At our dot local developer conference in London in October, we announced the general availability of MongoDB 8.0, the fastest and most performant version of MongoDB ever. MongoDB 8.0 performs 20% to 60% better against common industry benchmarks compared to our prior version and is built to exceed our customers' most stringent security, resiliency, availability, and performance requirements. To best serve our customers, we regularly review and reprioritize investments in our product portfolio to ensure we're allocating our resources to products with the highest demand from our customers. And to do that, we also deprecate products that are not showing results we desired. Consequently, we made the decision to consolidate our Atlas serverless offerings with our smallest dedicated tiers to create Atlas Flex customers, a new offering with a simpler architecture that provides the elasticity features akin to serverless. We will begin migrating effective customers to the single, simple, entry-level solution in Q4. We also decided to deprecate Atlas DeviceSync and other capabilities not widely adopted in order to focus our engineering resources on the core platform. While these reprioritization decisions are not made lightly, they allow us to deliver the most value to the largest number of customers, reinforcing our commitment to being the best modern database and helping us to grow faster. Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the adoption trends of MongoDB across our customer base. Customers across industries and around the world are running mission-critical projects in MongoDB Atlas, leveraging the full power of our developer data platform, including Financial Times, CarGurus, and Victoria's Secret. As part of the digital transformation journey, global specialty retailer Victoria's Secret & Company migrated its e-commerce platform to MongoDB Atlas. As a fully managed platform, MongoDB Atlas allowed the company to simplify its architecture and improve performance, supporting the retailer to provide a resilient, secure, and fast web and mobile e-commerce experience for their millions of customers around the world. Allianz, Alphamad, Swiss Post, and Paylocity are turning to MongoDB to modernize applications. Paylocity, a leading provider of cloud-based payroll and human capital management software, selected MongoDB to power proprietary application aimed at fostering employee connections and engagement. When traffic increased and the original SQL-based solution was unable to keep up with the required performance metrics, Paylocity migrated to MongoDB Atlas to take advantage of the flexible schema architecture, performance, and scalability. MongoDB costs five times less than the previous SQL database solution and the company's developers can now create an application within minutes, something that used to take weeks. Mature companies and start-ups alike are using MongoDB to help deliver the next wave of AI-powered application to customers, including NerdWallet, Cisco, and Tealbook. Tealbook, a supplier intelligence platform, migrated from Postgres, pgvector, and ElasticSearch to MongoDB to eliminate technical debt and consolidate their tech stack. The company experienced workload isolation and scalability issues in pgvector and were concerned with the search index inconsistencies, which were all resolved with the migration to MongoDB. With Atlas Vector search and dedicated search nodes, Tealbook has realized improved cost-efficiency and increased scalability for the supplier data platform, an application that uses GenAI to collect, verify, and enrich supplier data across various sources. In summary, we had a healthy Q3 with both Atlas and EA exceeding expectations. We saw a strong new business quarter and we remain confident in our ability to become an increasing strategic provider in our large and growing market. Looking forward, we see a great opportunity to grow our adoption in the enterprise through new workloads, modernizing legacy applications, and winning the next generation of AI-powered applications. I would like to finish by providing an update on our senior leadership. First, as we announced early in the press release, after nearly 10 years, Michael Gordon has made the decision to leave MongoDB. Michael has been instrumental in MongoDB's success over the past decade, leading our successful IPO, helping us grow our revenue nearly 50-fold, and scaling -- and successfully scaling our business model to generate meaningful operating leverage. He has been a trusted advisor and business partner to the Board and me over the years and also has become a personal friend. Michael is excited to take a well-deserved break. We have commenced the search for Michael's replacement and will be evaluating both internal and external candidates. One of Michael's proudest compliments -- accomplishments has been building a world-class finance team under his leadership, and I'm confident that we will not miss a beat during this transition. Michael will continue to serve as CFO through January 31st to help us finish the fiscal year and then will transition to an Advisor to the company to ensure a seamless process. If we have not named Michael's successor by fiscal year-end, Serge Tanjga, SVP of Finance, will serve as Interim CFO, beginning on February 1st. Second, we are promoting Cedric Pech, currently our chief revenue officer to the newly created role of president worldwide field operations. In this new position, Cedric will oversee all our field-based customer-facing and go-to-market enablement teams, including professional services. We believe this org structure will best enable us to execute on some of the key strategic initiatives I discussed earlier, in particular, our increased focus on up-market and the app monetization opportunity. I would like to congratulate Cedric on this well-deserved promotion. With that, let me turn the call over to Michael. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Dev, and thanks for the kind words and our incredible partnership over the past decade. The past 10 years have been the most rewarding in my professional career and I'm extremely proud of what we've achieved together and of course, to the whole MongoDB team. With as much success as we had, I still believe that MongoDB is in the early stages of realizing its full potential as it continues to take share in one of the largest markets in software. Now, turning to the results for the quarter. I'll begin with a detailed review of our third-quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025. First, I'll start with our third quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $529.4 million, up 22% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance. Shifting to our product mix, Atlas grew 26% in the quarter compared to the previous year and now represents 68% of total revenue compared to 66% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and 71% last quarter. We recognized Atlas revenue primarily based on customer consumption of our platform and that consumption is closely tied to end user activity of their applications. Let me provide some context on Atlas consumption in the quarter. In Q3, consumption was slightly ahead of our expectations. This year's Q3 seasonal improvement was more muted than in years past as expected. On a year-over-year basis, consumption growth remains below that of prior year period. Turning to non-Atlas revenue. Non-Atlas came in significantly ahead of our expectations. As Dev mentioned, EA new business was strong, and we continue to have success selling incremental workloads into our existing customer base. In addition, our Q3 non-Atlas revenue benefited from a few large multi-year deals. As you know, due to ASC 606, we recognized the entire term license component of a multi-year contract at the start of that contract. Compared to Q3 of last year, the multi-year license component of non-Atlas revenues was over $15 million higher. Turning to customer growth. During the third quarter, we grew our customer base by approximately 1,900 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 52,600, which is up from over 46,400 in the year-ago period. Of our total customer count, over 7,400 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 6,900 in the year-ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven primarily by Atlas, which had over 51,100 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 44,900 in the year-ago period. It is important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers adding their first Atlas workload. Continuing on, in Q3, our net ARR expansion rate was approximately 120%. We ended the quarter with 2,314 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, up from $1,972 in the year-ago period. Moving down the income statement, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the third quarter was $405.7 million, representing a gross margin of 77%, which is flat versus the year-ago period. Our income from operations was $101.5 million or 19% operating margin for the third quarter compared to an 18% operating margin in the year-ago period. The primary reason for more favorable operating income results versus guidance is our revenue outperformance, including the very high margin multi-year license revenue benefit. Net income in the third quarter was $98.1 million or $1.16 per share, based on 84.2 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a net income of $79.1 million or $0.96 per share on 83.7 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding in the year-ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the third quarter with $2.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $37.4 million. After taking into consideration approximately $2.9 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was $34.6 million in the quarter. This compares to free cash flow of $35 million in the year-ago period. In Q3, we did not incur capital expenditures to purchase IPV4 addresses as we previously expected, but we did start making those purchases in November and still expect a total outlay of $20 million to $25 million this fiscal year as we previously communicated. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $515 million to $519 million. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $55 million to $58 million and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.65 based on 84.9 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. For the full-fiscal year 2025, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.973 billion to $1.977 billion, non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $242 million to $245 million, and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $3.01 to $3.03 based on 84 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. Note that the non-GAAP net income per share guidance for the fourth-quarter and full-fiscal year 2025 includes a non-GAAP tax provision of approximately 20%. I'll now provide some more context around our updated guidance. First, in terms of Atlas consumption, we expect to see a typical seasonal slowdown in Q4, driven by underlying application usage moderating during the holiday season. Second, since Atlas consumption remained lower on a year-over-year basis in Q3, we expect to see continued deceleration of Atlas year-over-year growth in Q4. Third, we expect to see a sequential decline in non-Atlas revenue in Q4, which is contrary to our normal pattern. The reason for this is that we experienced a significant additional benefit from multi-year deals in Q3, which we do not expect to recur in Q4. In addition, I want to provide some incremental color on some of our recent product and -- how some of our recent product and go-to-market changes will impact the growth of our reported customer count going forward. First, as Dev explained, we are reallocating a portion of our go-to-market resources from the mid-market to the enterprise channel. As a result, we expect to see significantly fewer mid-market direct sales customer net additions and as a result, slower direct sales customer growth going forward. We believe this reallocation of investment dollars will drive higher revenue growth over time. So, it's a trade-off that makes sense. Second, as we introduce Atlas Flex clusters in Q4 and automatically migrate customers in Q1, we expect to see a one-time negative impact to our customer count since we have approximately 4,000 serverless customers who are very low spending and we do not expect them to transition over to Flex. These customers have a negligible impact on our revenue but will impact our reported customer count. To summarize, we're pleased with our third quarter results and especially our ability to win new business. We have a small share in one of the largest and fastest-growing markets in all of software with a number of secular tailwinds, including AI at our back. We'll continue investing judiciously and focusing on our execution to capture this long-term opportunity. With that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator? Questions & Answers: Operator [Operator instructions] Our first question for the day will be coming from Sanjit Singh of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Thank you for taking the questions and congrats, Michael, on outstanding career. You had an absolutely fantastic run at MongoDB. I'm excited to see what you do next, or excited if you just take a breather. So congrats, Michael. I guess to take the question -- to start off with the questions, when we look at what Atlas has been doing in the past two quarters, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think consumption is coming in at least modestly ahead of your expectations. Relative to what we've seen at the beginning of the year, what sort of -- is it a function of sales execution? Is it a function of the end-user activity sort of improving? What's driving at least the improvement in Atlas consumption in the past two quarters? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So a few different things. So I think if you look at our outlook at the beginning of the year, we had indicated that we thought we would see stable Atlas growth from a consumption standpoint. What we've seen and what we've talked about is -- we've actually seen lower year-over-year growth based on the underlying consumption. And so -- and that's incorporated into our Q4 guide. We have seen the Q3 and Q4 be -- sorry, Q2 and Q3, excuse me, be better than our expectations, but it's still down on a year-over-year basis. And so I want to make sure that we're not sort of confusing the comparative set of year-over-year versus relative to our expectations. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Understood. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer And the core of it, Sanjit, to your question is really the underlying usage of the applications. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Yeah, that makes total sense. And then, Dev, I have to ask you the AI agent question. In terms of an AI agent needing more context, it has going to have a set of tools to take its actions. What does it mean for MongoDB as an operational data store as customers start to roll out more agentic applications? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, just to talk about agents, I think when you think about agents, there's jobs, there's -- sorry, there's a job, there's projects and then there's task. Right now, the agents that are being rolled out are really focused on task like say something from Sierra or some other companies are rolling out agents. But you're right, what they deemed to do is to deal with being able to create a rich and complex data structures. Now why is this important for AI is that AI models don't just look at isolated data points, but they need to understand relationships, hierarchies, and patterns within the data. They need to be able to essentially get real-time insights. For example, if you have a chatbot where someone is querying, a customer is kind of trying to get some update on the order they placed five minutes ago because they may have not gotten any confirmation, your chatbot needs to be able to deal with real-time information. You need to be able to deal with basically handling very advanced use cases, understanding like, to do things like fraud detection to understand behaviors of supply chains, you need to understand intricate data relationships. All these things are consistent with MongoDB offers. And so we believe that at the end of the day, we are well-positioned to handle this. And the other thing that I would say is that we've embedded in a very natural way of search and vector search. So we're just not an OLTP database, we do tech search and vector search. That's all one experience and no other platform offers that, and we think we have a real advantage. And so we're integrated with the leading AI frameworks and platforms. We have enterprise-grade security and compliance, and customers can run us anywhere, either on 118 cloud regions or on-prem, and that again is a huge differentiator for us. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Awesome. Appreciate the thoughts, Dev. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Sanjit. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Taylor -- Tyler Radke of Citi. Your line is open. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Hi, thank you very much for taking the question. And, Michael, all the best, and congratulations on 10 years. Going back to the sales execution, I mean, one of the things that you talked about earlier this year was some challenges just in terms of the recently acquired workloads ramping. And I think a lot of those were from the past fiscal year. So curious how the quality of workload acquisition has trended this year. And as you think about the ramp in consumption potential into next year, how does that sort of look versus this time a year ago? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Maybe I'll just talk about what we're doing and the changes we made and then Michael can talk a little bit about the consumption trends. So, we did make some changes at the beginning of the year, and we really wanted to focus on both the volume and the quality of the workloads and there were some slight adjustments that we made. We think those changes are having a reasonable positive impact. Again, it's too early to declare victory because these workloads usually start small and grow over time, but we're really pleased with the results we're seeing so far. And -- but again, it's early days. And obviously, we'll know about the fiscal '25 workloads as we go into fiscal '26. But so far, so good. Michael, on consumption? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, just a couple of things, and thanks, Tyler. The fiscal '24 cohorts that we called out earlier, that slower growth does continue. They've been in line with our revised expectations. We made some changes that we talked about at the -- earlier in the year that should affect the fiscal '25 cohorts, but it's just too early to tell. On those, we need a few more quarters of data before you can really see if we're -- how we're seeing those behave differently. I will say we've talked about the new business environment and our success in new business. We have been pleased with that, but that just shows kind of the initial piece, and we need to see how they grow and how those cohorts evolve. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Great. Thanks. And follow-up on the EA side, you talked about the outsized strength in non-Atlas business this quarter. Maybe if you could unpack like the relative upside that was driven by simply duration versus new business. I know you called out the duration impact year-over-year, but are -- do you feel like this was sort of a one-off or do you feel like maybe some of your bigger customers are indexing more toward EA and how does that impact the way you think about the product and introducing things like vector search and stream processing onto the on-prem product? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, thank you. So overall, we continue to find the EA product resonate with customers. It's an important part of the run anywhere strategy and we've continued to see success with that and people wanting to increase their investment in MongoDB. There's always been a multiyear component and we continue to see that. We talked about that at the beginning of the year as to how fiscal '24 had an abnormally high amount of multi-year benefit and therefore, we were anticipating that being a headwind and we quantified that in roughly the $40 million range. What we talked about on this call earlier is we saw from a few large accounts, a surprising amount of multiyear that positively benefited Q3 at a little more than $15 million in revenue compared to what we saw Q3 a year ago. So, not as much of a headwind as we had been expecting. Obviously, with the 606 dynamics, some of these things, especially for a large deal can be kind of meaty and chunky and lumpy, which is why we try and call it out and sort of help people understand, but there's a pretty healthy kind of baseline flow, not just of EA, but also of multiyear. And when we see spikes, we just try and call it out for you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I just want to add, Tyler, that we are investing in our what we call our EA business. First, we're starting by investing with search and vector search and a community product. That does a couple of things for us. One, whenever anyone starts with MongoDB with the open-source product, they immediately get all the benefits of that complete highly integrated platform. Two, those capabilities will then migrate to EA. So, EA for us is an investment strategy. We definitely see lots of large customers who are very, very committed to running workloads on-prem. We even see some customers want to run to run AI workloads on-prem. So, the optionality they get by using MongoDB to not just be on-prem and the cloud, but also cross-cloud is a very compelling one. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Brad Reback of Stifel. Your line is open. Brad Reback -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. And, Michael, best of luck. It's been a great run. Dev, you started the call talking about a bunch of investments, which are great given the growth of the business. And obviously, you talked about reallocating some expenses. But net-net, should we think about this incremental investment phase next year as gating margin upside? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think that's something that we obviously are not ready to talk about next year just now, but I would say that we -- the reason we're looking to invest and just to summarize again, going up-market on legacy app modernization where we see very large workloads potentially at play and being the ideal database for GenAI apps, which is the future as important investments to drive long-term growth. And we're quite energized by those investments and that's something that we have high conviction on. Brad Reback -- Analyst That's great. And then on the MAAP program, are most of those workloads going to wind up in Atlas or will that be a healthy combination of EA and Atlas? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think it's again early days. I would say -- I would probably say more on the side of Atlas and EA in the early days. I think once we introduce a search and vector search into the EA product, you'll see more of that on-prem. Obviously, people can use MongoDB for AI workloads using other technologies as well in conjunction with MongoDB for on-prem AI use cases. But I would say you're probably going to see that happen first in Atlas. Brad Reback -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Jason Ader of William Blair. Your line is open. Jason Ader -- Analyst Yeah, thank you. I'm not going to belabor congratulating Michael, but it has been it has been fun working with you and best of luck. The question I had is on the strength in EA. Do you think, Dev, it represents a comment on how enterprises might be rethinking or reassessing the kind of on-prem versus cloud workload placement decision? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Well, when I think about large enterprises, I think large enterprises have meaningful workloads that are still running on-prem. I think the belief that everything would go to the cloud was probably something that was really popular in the good old days of Zurp. But I think now as customers assess their investments that they already have in place, they're being much more judicious about where they run those workloads and if they think they can leverage their existing investments in their own infrastructure, then they're going to do so. Also for a bunch of other reasons like regulatory reasons, some customers are quite not moving as aggressively to the cloud. We see that in particularly in Europe, where we see a lot of the European banks still running majority of the workloads on-prem. So it also varies by region where conversely in Asia, we're seeing people much move much more aggressively to the cloud. So I think it really depends on industry, on geography, and on the personal dynamics of what's happening in that particular account. I mean, we see some large US banks are also very committed to running things on-prem. So it really varies. And that's why we feel really good about our run anywhere strategy because it gives customer optionality. They can build something and run on-prem. And if and when they choose to move to the cloud, it's very easy to do so with MongoDB. Jason Ader -- Analyst All right. And then just as a follow-up also on the investments you're making in strategic sales and enterprise. Could you just get a little more specific on what those investments might be? Is it hiring a lot of new salespeople? Is it working more with SIs, investing more in SIs? Any additional detail would be helpful. Thanks. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So just for everyone's benefit, we've identified a number of accounts, which we call strategic accounts, which we think that have high upside for us. We've seen a number of accounts that grow very quickly when we deploy the right mix of resources. Now they're all not necessarily quota-carrying resources. They could be additional technical sales resources, additional PS resources, additional customer service resources to better service and support those accounts. We even do things like run education sessions for developers of the accounts, they're called either hackathons or like what we call developer days or even design reviews where we'll meet with our development teams who are looking to build an application, help them think about how they would potentially use MongoDB to build that particular app. And what we find is that because many of these developers, the experience with MongoDB is quite limited, the more we can engage with them, the more we can educate them and the more we can show them how simple and easy it is. Like for example, most customers today think like they have to use an OLTP database, then a search database, maybe a vector database, and then like a caching database. And all that is integrated in MongoDB. So all of a sudden, customers can say, wow, I can simplify my life, simplify my back-end infrastructure, build this app far more quickly and it will be much more easier to manage long-term if I do everything on MongoDB. And it's really a function of just educating them on the power of MongoDB that really opens up a lot of opportunities for us. So that's why we're doubling down, and the mix of resources is really predicated on the accounts, but it's not just quota counting resources, it's the whole suite of resources that we're bringing to the table. Jason Ader -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Andrew Nowinski of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Okay. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking the question and congrats on a nice quarter. You gave an example of a customer that migrated off Postgres and I think you said they had issues with their PG vector function. I was wondering how long was that customer using Postgres before they decided to make a change to Mongo, meaning was this some sort of like a rebound type customer where they chose PG -- or excuse me, Postgres and it didn't work? And then how frequently are you seeing this type of transition? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So I can't give you the specifics on how long they were using Postgres, but this is not -- this is a trend that we're seeing in our business. You have to remember Postgres is a 40-year-old technology. It's -- and they have been the beneficiary of people lifting and shifting from other types of relational databases, Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, et cetera. And they're an open-source database. And but as part -- because they're an open-source and relational database, they have the same inherent challenges all relational databases do. They're quite inflexible. So once you build a schema, it's very hard to change the schema. It's hard to scale and hard to distribute data. And if you have large data volumes, you have to do weird things like, for example, resort to off-road storage for large data objects, which creates performance bottlenecks. And so again, people default to Postgres if they don't know anything better because all they know is relational and everyone is kind of moving off those other relational platforms. And that's the whole point I was saying earlier. Once we educate developers on the flexibility of schema, how easily or horizontally scale the rich query language where you can do aggregations and do sophisticated geospatial indexes, the productivity gains by using the document model and how easy is to organize data, it's -- people are just like, wow, life is so much easier. Now I want to be clear, this is not a zero-sum game. Postgres does not have to fail for us to be successful. It's a big market and we're quite excited about the opportunity, but we do see customers moving off Postgres and coming to MongoDB. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Thank you. That was very helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up. If we normalize the $15 million multiyear deal impact you had in Q3, would EA still be down sequentially in Q4? Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer We haven't given that level of guidance, but just trying to help you understand in the context of the full-year numbers and the headwind that we talked about at the beginning of the year, just given the strength that we saw in Q3. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Got it. Thanks. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. The next question will be coming from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst Hey, thank you. And if you think about the EA strength this quarter, Michael, you'd kind of give us a little bit there. Like how should we think about renewal -- the renewal situation renewal pool coming up like or that you had in Q3, coming up in Q4, et cetera, as well and then like what does it mean in terms of upsell, cross-sell opportunity as people think about starting AI projects by self-serve, as you kind of mentioned earlier on the call? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So I think about -- if you think about EA for Q4, it tends to be a large renewal quarter, but what we're talking about in terms of the guide is because we had such strength in multiyear, that's where we would expect to see our EA down sequentially, which is not typically our pattern, which is why we called it out. In terms of AI workloads and some of those other things, I think it's early to tell and obviously, we'll continue to evolve and assess our view when we get to the full-year guide in March. And then we'll also have an updated view on how the cohorts are behaving and sort of how multiyear played out. But I think in terms of Q4, the comments that I made earlier hopefully will help. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst Yeah. Okay, perfect. And then the -- and can you talk a little bit about like obviously, there's a debate of like which database will be the persistent layer if you do AI projects, et cetera. What do you see from the big hyperscalers in terms of working with you guys and partnerships? We obviously just have AWS kind of summit, et-cetera. Can you speak a little bit like how your relationship with those big guys is evolving around this? And Michael, All the best in case I don't talk to you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, I'll start with the partnerships first, like our -- with AWS, as you said, they just had their re:Invent show last week. Our -- it remains very, very strong. We've closed a ton of deals this past quarter. Some of them very, very large deals. We're doing integrations to some of the new products like Q and Bedrock and the engagement in the field has been really strong. On Azure, I think we -- as I've shared in the past, we start-off with a little bit of a slow start, but in the words of the person who runs their partner leadership, the Azure MongoDB relationship has never been stronger. We've closed a large number of deals. We're part of what's called the Azure native IC service program and have a bunch of deep integrations with Azure, including Fabric, Power BI, Visual Studio, Semantic Kernel, and Azure OpenAI Studio. And we're also one of Azure's largest marketplace partners. And GCP does -- we have actually seen some uptick in terms of co-sales that we've done this past quarter and GCP made some comp changes where they -- that were favorable to working with MongoDB that we saw some results in the field, and we're focused on closing on -- closing a handful of large deals with GCP in Q4. So in general, I would say, things are going quite well. And then in terms of, I guess, implying your question was like the hyperscalers and are they potentially bundling things along with their AI offerings? I mean, candidly, since day one, the hyperscalers have been bundling their database offerings with every offering that they have and that's been their predominant strategy. And we've -- I think we've executed well against strategy because databases are not like a by-the-way decision. It's an important decision. And I think the hyperscalers are seeing our performance and realize it's better to partner with us. And as I said, customers understand the importance of the data layer, especially for AI applications. And so the partnership across all three hyperscalers is strong. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst OK, perfect. Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Raimo. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. The next question will be coming from the line of Brad Sills of Bank of America. Your line is open. Brad Sills -- Analyst Great. Thank you so much, and congratulations, Michael, on your next move. I wanted to ask about new workloads here on vector search, stream processing, relational migrator. Is there any one of those three that's ramping faster than maybe you expected? Just a little bit of color on how those new workload types are ramping. Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I'll kind of give you just a rundown of some of the -- I mean, essentially you're asking about the new products, like our -- on search, we introduced a new capability called Atlas search nodes, which where you can asymmetrically scale your search nodes because if you have a search-intensive use case, you don't have to scale all your nodes because they have become quite expensive. And we've seen that this kind of groundbreaking capability really well received. The demand is quite high and because customers like they can tune the configuration to the unique needs of their search requirements. One of the world's largest banks is using Atlas Search to provide like a Google-like search experience on payments data for massive corporate customers. So this is a customer-facing application and so performance, and scalability are critical. A leading provider of AI-powered accounting software uses Atlas Search to power its invoice analytics future, which allows end users and finance teams to perform ad-hoc analysis and easily find past-due invoices and voices that contain errors. So that search -- on vector search, it -- again, and it's been our kind of our first full-year since going generally available. And the product uptake has been actually very, very high. In Q3, we released quantization for Atlas Vector Search, which reduces the memory requirements by up to 96%, allowing us to support larger vector workloads with vastly improved price performance. For example, a multinational news organization created a GenAI powered tool designed to help producers and journalists efficiently search, summarize, and verify information from vast and varied data sources. A leading security firm is using Atlas Vector Search to fight AI fraud and a leading global media company replaced elastic search with hybrid search and vector search use case for a user recommendation engine that's built to suggest -- that's built in to suggest articles to end users. And so that's super exciting to see as well. We're also seeing a lot of interest in our streaming product, demand is very high. We just rolled it out to another hyperscaler, and customers are commenting on that the use cases of being able to embed stream processing with MongoDB makes our life so much easier. So overall, we're quite pleased with the progress we're making on the new products. And as I said before, natively bundling all these capabilities really reduces or eliminates the need for customers to have to bolt on a bunch of different technologies to solve the same problem, saving them a lot of time, money, cost, and risk. Brad Sills -- Analyst That's really exciting. Thanks, Dev. And then I wanted to ask a question around Cedric's appointment. Any focus that may be different here under his leadership that we should be thinking about going forward? Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer No, Cedric has been our CRO for, gosh, now like I think like five, six years, and he -- I was the Interim CRO for about three quarters until he took over when we last made a change and this is really an expansion of his responsibilities. I've known Cedric for a long time. He and I have worked with at multiple different companies. I think I have a good barometer for understanding sales leadership. There's a number of sales leaders who worked at other top-tier software companies who used to work for me or with me. And so I'm super-excited by the role Cedric is going to take and then we're also making some changes under Cedric to better align the different organizations so that we can more tightly work together on going up-market, on app monetization and positioning ourselves well to be the ideal database for GenAI apps. Brad Sills -- Analyst Super exciting. Thanks, Dev. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Brad. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question, please. Our next question will be coming from the line of Mike Cikos of Needham and Company. Your line is open. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Hey guys, thanks for taking the question here. I just wanted to come back to the consumption growth being slightly better than expectations again for the second quarter in a row now. And apologies if I missed it, but this improvement that we're seeing, is this across all vintages and geographies or is it potentially more concentrated in scope? Just trying to get a better understanding of what's seeking place out there and what's embedded in the guide. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. No, I would describe it as broad-based, Mike. And obviously, we're pleased to see it and we're continuing monitoring and slicing and dicing it in different ways. And as we have information or insights to you, we'll share it. And without trying to throw a whole bunch of cold water on our mind, it was slightly better, or a step-function changed better, but good to see. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Terrific. And maybe for a quick follow-up for Dev. I think it builds off maybe Tyler's question at the top of the Q&A, but you had cited that some customers are thinking about their workloads more holistically and even looking to run AI workloads on-prem. How much of that do you think is just a function of customers are still trying to figure out how to optimize for latency and cost or is this more a demonstration of we really are in the early phases of the exploratory phase versus going into production? Is there any way to coarse that out or is the two not necessarily connected? Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer No, I think it's kind of a little bit of both. I think you have some customers who are very committed to running a big part of the estate on-prem. So by definition, then if they're going to build an AI workload, it has to be run on-prem, which means that they also need access to GPUs and they're doing that. And then other customers are leveraging basically renting GPUs from the cloud providers and building their own AI workloads. I do think we're in the very, very early days. They're still learning, experimenting. More-and-more apps are entering production. And as I said on the prepared remarks, we have thousands of workload -- AI workloads running on MongoDB, but a very small percentage of them have demonstrated meaningful product market fit. And so the initial traction is kind of still small. But I think as people get more sophisticated with AI, as the AI technology matures and becomes more and more useful, I think applications will -- you'll start seeing these applications take-off. I kind of chuckled that today I see more senior leaders bragging about the chips they're using versus the apps they're building. So it just tells you that we're still in the very, very early days of this big platform shift. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Great point. Thank you again, guys. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Mike. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Eric Heath of KeyBanc. Your line is open. Eric Heath -- Analyst Hi, thanks for taking the question. Dev, Michael, it sounds like the takeaway from the call is a greater focus on EA and on enterprise. So should we structurally rethink the EA business differently and think of this more as a healthy double-digit growth business going forward for the foreseeable future? And then if I could just ask a follow-up question separate to that. But Michael, I understand that it's still early to identify the fiscal '25 cohort of workloads, but just curious at a high-level if they look and feel like of higher quality than the fiscal '24 cohort of workflow. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Do you want to take on the first one in terms of EA... Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, I mean, I would say, I mean, we are very committed to our run anywhere strategy. And as I said, we are first investing in community where for many customers is the first way they experience MongoDB. And we want them to have the full experience of integrating search and Vector search into our core product. And so they can out of the gate really start building applications. That will then transition to building those capabilities into EA. So, we are clearly investing in the EA product. But Atlas is still a big, big part of our business and a big, big part of our growth engine and we typically launch new features on Atlas and because of the capabilities we already have, the fact it's multi-cloud makes it a very, very compelling offering for many customers. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. And I think in terms of the workloads, I do think it's early. Just as a reminder for folks, they tend to start small, although grow quickly. I think the only other thing that I can add is, we've been pretty consistent and that we've been pleased with the new business that we've done. But we need some time to let the cohorts play out as we track them. But I think like I said, we've been happy with the new business that we were winning. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of William Power of Baird. Your line is open. Brian Raferty Denyeau -- Investor Relations You there, William? William Power -- Analyst Sorry, yeah. Thank you. Dev, you had some encouraging comments on relational migrator. I wonder if you could just touch on what you think is driving the higher interest here. I mean, it sounds like AI is contributing and helping, but it'd be great to get some more color there because that still feels like obviously a meaningful long-term opportunity. And then maybe the second part of the question for Dev or Michael, just be great to get any other framework around the professional services investments. Any way to kind of think about quantification and timing of that? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So the reason we're so excited about the opportunity to go after legacy applications is that, one, it seems like there's a confluence of events happening. One is that the increasing cost and tax of supporting and managing these legacy apps are just going up enough. Second, for many customers who are in regulated industries, the regulators are calling their -- the fact that they're running on these legacy apps with systemic risk, so they can no longer kick the can down the road. Third, also because they no longer can kick the can around, some vendors are going end-of-life, so they have to make a decision to migrate those applications to a more modern tech stack. Fourth, because GenAI is so predicated on data and to build a competitive advantage, you need to leverage your proprietary data, people want to access that data and be able to do so easily. And so that's another reason for them to want to modernize. And then you also have people who built those applications who are retiring or just no longer in the firm, so it just creates more and more risk for the companies. Given all that, customers are incredibly interested in figuring out a way to easily and safely and securely migrate those -- off those applications. And we always could help them very easily move the data and map the schema from a relational schema to a document schema. The hardest part was essentially rewriting the application. Now with the advent of GenAI, you can now significantly reduce the time. One, you can use GenAI to analyze existing code. Two, you can use GenAI to reverse engineer tests to test what the code does. And then three, you can use GenAI to build new code and then users test it to ensure that the new code produces the same results as the old code. And so all that time and effort is suddenly cut in a meaningful way and that's suddenly creating a lot of interest from customers saying, my goodness. And if you're already on a relational app, moving to another relational app doesn't feel like modernization. So, the other advantage is that moving to MongoDB gives them a much more modern platform, a much more agile, flexible, performant, and scalable platform for their future needs. And that's why we're so excited. Again, it's early days. We've run a number of pilots that have gone well. We're in the process of working with some customers now in the migration process. This will take time because these are very, very complex applications. And actually, one thing I also mentioned was that they're not just going after -- saying go after some tertiary Tier 2 or Tier 3 application, they're saying, hey, we want you to look at some of our crown jewels because these are the apps that are most painful for us. So that's also very exciting. But again, this will take time, but we're very committed to this, and we think this is going to drive -- help us drive long-term -- meaningful long-term growth. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, Will. And to the last part of your question on the professional services investment, we're really building out that capacity in order to meet the demand that we're seeing relative to the opportunity. We're calling it in particular because it has a gross margin impact because that's where that will typically show up. And then maybe the last thing and it's probably obvious, but just to sort of underscore it is the reason we're doing this though is for the ARR, right, to drive the new workloads, the additional workloads over to MongoDB as part of that migration. And over time, as we've talked about before, we hope and expect to be able to leverage technology more and more, but at least initially and into the medium-term, there's going to be a healthy human/services component to that. Just wanted to sort of effectively telegraph that out to folks. William Power -- Analyst That's helpful. Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Will. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Rudy Kessinger of DA Davidson. Please go ahead. Rudy Kessinger -- Analyst Hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in here. I believe last quarter you said consumption growth slightly ahead of expectations. And while down slower year-over-year growth versus Q2 last year, the year-over-year growth did improve from Q1. And so, I guess I'm curious for Q3, could you make a comment in that same regard? Obviously, slower on a year-over-year basis than Q3 last year, but was it stable with year-over-year consumption growth in Q2 or better or worse? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Rudy, thanks for the question. We haven't specifically called that out relative to Q2. We did see a lower year-over-year growth as we called out. We did see a seasonal rebound. Usually Q3 is stronger than Q2 and we talked about how that was smaller than in the prior year. So hopefully, that will help you all triangulate. Rudy Kessinger -- Analyst Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. I believe it was on your Q4 call back in March. At that point, Dev, you said it would be at least another year until AI applications are being deployed at scale. It sounds like the commentary that some early large workloads, but out of the thousands, just not many that are at large scale. I guess, is your expectation now that maybe it's still at least another year until we're seeing broad AI application rollouts at scale? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I think a lot of it's a function of the what's happening in the R&D side of AI, right? So for example, today, we don't have a very compelling model designed for our phones, right, because today the phones don't have the computing horsepower to run complex models. So, you don't see a ton of very, very successful consumer apps besides, say, ChatGPT or Claude. So we don't -- we also don't see like hundreds of apps taking off like you saw kind of the first generation of like the Internet or the cloud era, right, or the mobile era. So like I think we're still in the early days of AI. And so while we see a lot of people building AI apps, a lot of them have kind of fairly rudimentary functionality. But I think that over time that's going to change. In fact, I know it will change. I just can't predict when that will happen. But where we do see apps having production, we are having traction, we're seeing them grow very, very quickly and we have a lot of them on our platform. It's just very few of them are really have meaningful. Operator Thank you. And that concludes today's Q&A session. I would like to go ahead and turn the call back over to Dev for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, everyone. I just wanted to say we're really pleased with our Q3 results with strong new business performance and revenue exceeding expectations both -- across both Atlas and EA. We're making the necessary investments to expand our enterprise channel where we see the largest opportunity to establish MongoDB as a standard and the strongest returns on our go-to-market investments. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the progress we're making on both accelerating legacy app modernization with AI as well as establishing ourselves as a standard of the emerging AI tech stack for greenfield AI applications. And last but not least, I would like to thank Michael again for his contributions over the past 10 years and wish him well. Thank you, everyone, and we'll talk to you soon.

representing 68% total revenue. generated non-gaap operating income $101 million 19% non-gaap operating margin ended quarter 52,600 customers. overall, pleased performance third quarter. strong new business quarter happy new workload acquisition atlas. non-atlas business significantly exceeded expectation part benefited large multi-year deal customer continue value run anywhere strategy want build deeper longer-term relationship mongodb. atlas consumption slightly better expected macro-environment would characterize largely consistent saw first half year. michael cover consumption trend detail. retention rate remained strong q3, demonstrating mission criticality platform. q1 earnings call, shared three major strategic initiative believe enable u maximize long-term opportunity. want give update progress making initiatives. first, increasing investment enterprise channel since see strongest return part market. specifically, expanding strategic account program going next year, see account benefit incremental investment. addition, investing time resource educate developer large enterprise account uplevel mongodb skills. organization thousand developer penetrate deeply, encounter developer historically built sql application simply know use mongodb full potential. experience, educating developer benefit mongodb drive significant incremental adoption platform. fund up-market investments, reallocating portion mid-market investments. mid-market remains attractive opportunity us, believe prioritizing investment up-market deliver strong return current environment. also believe additional way serve mid-market efficiently self-serve channel scaled technology-enabled sale customer service motions. second, optimistic opportunity accelerate legacy app modernization using ai investing area. recall, ran successful pilot earlier year, demonstrating ai tooling combined professional service relational migrator product significantly reduce time, cost, risk migrating legacy application onto mongodb. early days, observed 50% reduction cost modernize. back strong early results, additional customer interest exceeding expectations. large enterprise every industry geography experiencing acute pain legacy infrastructure eager agile, performant, cost-effective solutions. customer excited engage us, also want focus important application enterprise, demonstrating level interest size long-term opportunity. relational application encompass wide variety database types, programming languages, versions, customer-specific variables, expect modernization project continue include meaningful service engagement short medium term. consequently, increasing professional service delivery capabilities, directly partners. long run, expect automate simplify large part modernization process. end, leveraging learning early service engagement develop new tool accelerate future modernization efforts. although early day scaling legacy app modernization capability take time, increased conviction motion significantly add growth long term. third, investing capitalize inherent technical advantage key component emerging ai tech stack. reminder, mongodb uniquely equipped query rich complex data structure typical ai applications. ability database query rich complex data structure crucial ai application often rely highly detailed, interrelated, nuanced data make accurate prediction decisions. example, recommendation system analyze single customer's purchase also considers browsing history, peer group behavior, product category requiring database query interlink complex data structures. addition, mongodb's architecture unifies source data, metadata, operational data, vector data all-in-one platform, updating need multiple database system complex back-end architectures. enables compelling developer experience alternative. see ai market today, customer still experimental stage work understand effectiveness underlying tech stack build early proof-of-concept applications. however, seeing increasing number ai apps production. today, thousand ai apps platform. yet see many apps actually achieving meaningful product market fit therefore significant traction. fact, take step back look entire universe ai apps, small percentage achieved type scale commonly see enterprise-specific applications. ai apps growing quickly, including one already seven-figure workload grown 10 time since beginning year. similar prior platform shift usefulness ai tech improves becomes cost-effective, see emergence many ai apps nail product market fit, difficult predict happen broadly. remain confident capture fair share successful ai application see platform popular developer building sophisticated ai use cases. continue investing product capabilities, including enterprise-grade atlas vector search functionality build momentum even better position mongodb capture ai opportunity. addition, previously announced, bringing search vector service community ea offerings, leveraging run anywhere competitive advantage world ai. finally, expanding mongodb ai application program maap, help enterprise customer build bring ai application production providing reference architectures, integration leading tech providers, coordinated service support. last week, announced new code partner including mckinsey, confluent, capgemini, unstructured, well collaboration meta enable developer build ai-enriched application mongodb using llama. next, like provide brief product update. dot local developer conference london october, announced general availability mongodb 8.0, fastest performant version mongodb ever. mongodb 8.0 performs 20% 60% better common industry benchmark compared prior version built exceed customers' stringent security, resiliency, availability, performance requirements. best serve customers, regularly review reprioritize investment product portfolio ensure allocating resource product highest demand customers. that, also deprecate product showing result desired. consequently, made decision consolidate atlas serverless offering smallest dedicated tier create atlas flex customers, new offering simpler architecture provides elasticity feature akin serverless. begin migrating effective customer single, simple, entry-level solution q4. also decided deprecate atlas devicesync capability widely adopted order focus engineering resource core platform. reprioritization decision made lightly, allow u deliver value largest number customers, reinforcing commitment best modern database helping u grow faster. now, like spend minute reviewing adoption trend mongodb across customer base. customer across industry around world running mission-critical project mongodb atlas, leveraging full power developer data platform, including financial times, cargurus, victoria's secret. part digital transformation journey, global specialty retailer victoria's secret & company migrated e-commerce platform mongodb atlas. fully managed platform, mongodb atlas allowed company simplify architecture improve performance, supporting retailer provide resilient, secure, fast web mobile e-commerce experience million customer around world. allianz, alphamad, swiss post, paylocity turning mongodb modernize applications. paylocity, leading provider cloud-based payroll human capital management software, selected mongodb power proprietary application aimed fostering employee connection engagement. traffic increased original sql-based solution unable keep required performance metrics, paylocity migrated mongodb atlas take advantage flexible schema architecture, performance, scalability. mongodb cost five time less previous sql database solution company's developer create application within minutes, something used take weeks. mature company start-ups alike using mongodb help deliver next wave ai-powered application customers, including nerdwallet, cisco, tealbook. tealbook, supplier intelligence platform, migrated postgres, pgvector, elasticsearch mongodb eliminate technical debt consolidate tech stack. company experienced workload isolation scalability issue pgvector concerned search index inconsistencies, resolved migration mongodb. atlas vector search dedicated search nodes, tealbook realized improved cost-efficiency increased scalability supplier data platform, application us genai collect, verify, enrich supplier data across various sources. summary, healthy q3 atlas ea exceeding expectations. saw strong new business quarter remain confident ability become increasing strategic provider large growing market. looking forward, see great opportunity grow adoption enterprise new workloads, modernizing legacy applications, winning next generation ai-powered applications. would like finish providing update senior leadership. first, announced early press release, nearly 10 years, michael gordon made decision

congratulate cedric well-deserved promotion. that, let turn call michael. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer thanks, dev, thanks kind word incredible partnership past decade. past 10 year rewarding professional career extremely proud achieved together course, whole mongodb team. much success had, still believe mongodb early stage realizing full potential continues take share one largest market software. now, turning result quarter. begin detailed review third-quarter result finish outlook fourth quarter full fiscal year 2025. first, start third quarter results. total revenue quarter $529.4 million, 22% year-over-year high end guidance. shifting product mix, atlas grew 26% quarter compared previous year represents 68% total revenue compared 66% third quarter fiscal 2024 71% last quarter. recognized atlas revenue primarily based customer consumption platform consumption closely tied end user activity applications. let provide context atlas consumption quarter. q3, consumption slightly ahead expectations. year's q3 seasonal improvement muted year past expected. year-over-year basis, consumption growth remains prior year period. turning non-atlas revenue. non-atlas came significantly ahead expectations. dev mentioned, ea new business strong, continue success selling incremental workload existing customer base. addition, q3 non-atlas revenue benefited large multi-year deals. know, due asc 606, recognized entire term license component multi-year contract start contract. compared q3 last year, multi-year license component non-atlas revenue $15 million higher. turning customer growth. third quarter, grew customer base approximately 1,900 customer sequentially, bringing total customer count 52,600, 46,400 year-ago period. total customer count, 7,400 direct sale customers, compare 6,900 year-ago period. growth total customer count driven primarily atlas, 51,100 customer end quarter compared 44,900 year-ago period. important keep mind growth atlas customer count reflects new customer mongodb addition existing ea customer adding first atlas workload. continuing on, q3, net arr expansion rate approximately 120%. ended quarter 2,314 customer least $100,000 arr annualized mrr, $1,972 year-ago period. moving income statement, discussing result non-gaap basis unless otherwise noted. gross profit third quarter $405.7 million, representing gross margin 77%, flat versus year-ago period. income operation $101.5 million 19% operating margin third quarter compared 18% operating margin year-ago period. primary reason favorable operating income result versus guidance revenue outperformance, including high margin multi-year license revenue benefit. net income third quarter $98.1 million $1.16 per share, based 84.2 million diluted weighted average share outstanding. compare net income $79.1 million $0.96 per share 83.7 million diluted weighted-average share outstanding year-ago period. turning balance sheet cash flow, ended third quarter $2.3 billion cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash. operating cash flow third quarter $37.4 million. taking consideration approximately $2.9 million capital expenditure principal repayment finance lease liabilities, free cash flow $34.6 million quarter. compare free cash flow $35 million year-ago period. q3, incur capital expenditure purchase ipv4 address previously expected, start making purchase november still expect total outlay $20 million $25 million fiscal year previously communicated. like turn outlook fourth quarter full fiscal year 2025. fourth quarter, expect revenue range $515 million $519 million. expect non-gaap income operation range $55 million $58 million non-gaap net income per share range $0.62 $0.65 based 84.9 million estimated diluted weighted-average share outstanding. full-fiscal year 2025, expect revenue range $1.973 billion $1.977 billion, non-gaap income operation range $242 million $245 million, non-gaap net income per share range $3.01 $3.03 based 84 million estimated diluted weighted-average share outstanding. note non-gaap net income per share guidance fourth-quarter full-fiscal year 2025 includes non-gaap tax provision approximately 20%. provide context around updated guidance. first, term atlas consumption, expect see typical seasonal slowdown q4, driven underlying application usage moderating holiday season. second, since atlas consumption remained lower year-over-year basis q3, expect see continued deceleration atlas year-over-year growth q4. third, expect see sequential decline non-atlas revenue q4, contrary normal pattern. reason experienced significant additional benefit multi-year deal q3, expect recur q4. addition, want provide incremental color recent product -- recent product go-to-market change impact growth reported customer count going forward. first, dev explained, reallocating portion go-to-market resource mid-market enterprise channel. result, expect see significantly fewer mid-market direct sale customer net addition result, slower direct sale customer growth going forward. believe reallocation investment dollar drive higher revenue growth time. so, trade-off make sense. second, introduce atlas flex cluster q4 automatically migrate customer q1, expect see one-time negative impact customer count since approximately 4,000 serverless customer low spending expect transition flex. customer negligible impact revenue impact reported customer count. summarize, pleased third quarter result especially ability win new business. small share one largest fastest-growing market software number secular tailwinds, including ai back. continue investing judiciously focusing execution capture long-term opportunity. that, like open questions. operator? question & answers: operator [operator instructions] first question day coming sanjit singh morgan stanley. line open. sanjit singh -- analyst thank taking question congrats, michael, outstanding career. absolutely fantastic run mongodb. excited see next, excited take breather. congrats, michael. guess take question -- start questions, look atlas past two quarters, correct wrong, think consumption coming least modestly ahead expectations. relative seen beginning year, sort -- function sale execution? function end-user activity sort improving? what's driving least improvement atlas consumption past two quarters? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. different things. think look outlook beginning year, indicated thought would see stable atlas growth consumption standpoint. seen talked -- actually seen lower year-over-year growth based underlying consumption. -- that's incorporated q4 guide. seen q3 q4 -- sorry, q2 q3, excuse me, better expectations, still year-over-year basis. want make sure sort confusing comparative set year-over-year versus relative expectations. sanjit singh -- analyst understood. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer core it, sanjit, question really underlying usage applications. sanjit singh -- analyst yeah, make total sense. then, dev, ask ai agent question. term ai agent needing context, going set tool take actions. mean mongodb operational data store customer start roll agentic applications? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. so, talk agents, think think agents, there's jobs, there's -- sorry, there's job, there's project there's task. right now, agent rolled really focused task like say something sierra company rolling agents. right, deemed deal able create rich complex data structures. important ai ai model look isolated data points, need understand relationships, hierarchies, pattern within data. need able essentially get real-time insights. example, chatbot someone querying, customer kind trying get update order placed five minute ago may gotten confirmation, chatbot need able deal real-time information. need able deal basically handling advanced use cases, understanding like, thing like fraud detection understand behavior supply chains, need understand intricate data relationships. thing consistent mongodb offers. believe end day, well-positioned handle this. thing would say embedded natural way search vector search. oltp database, tech search vector search. that's one experience platform offer that, think real advantage. integrated leading ai framework platforms. enterprise-grade security compliance, customer run u anywhere, either 118 cloud region on-prem, huge differentiator us. sanjit singh -- analyst awesome. appreciate thoughts, dev. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, sanjit. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line taylor -- tyler radke citi. line open. tyler radke -- analyst hi, thank much taking question. and, michael, best, congratulation 10 years. going back sale execution, mean, one thing talked earlier year challenge term recently acquired workload ramping. think lot past fiscal year. curious quality workload acquisition trended year. think ramp consumption potential next year, sort look versus time year ago? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. maybe talk change made michael talk little bit consumption trends. so, make change beginning year, really wanted focus volume quality workload slight adjustment made. think change reasonable positive impact. again, early declare victory workload usually start small grow time, really pleased result seeing far. -- again, early days. obviously, know fiscal '25 workload go fiscal '26. far, good. michael, consumption? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, couple things, thanks, tyler. fiscal '24 cohort called earlier, slower growth continue. line revised expectations. made change talked -- earlier year affect fiscal '25 cohorts, early tell. those, need quarter data really see -- seeing behave differently. say talked new business environment success new business. pleased that, show kind initial piece, need see grow cohort evolve. tyler radke -- analyst great. thanks. follow-up ea side, talked outsized strength non-atlas business quarter. maybe could unpack like relative upside driven simply duration versus new business. know called duration impact year-over-year, -- feel like sort one-off feel like maybe bigger customer indexing toward ea impact way think product introducing thing like vector search stream processing onto on-prem product? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah, thank you. overall, continue find ea product resonate customers. important part run anywhere strategy continued see success people wanting increase investment mongodb. there's always multiyear component continue see that. talked beginning year fiscal '24 abnormally high amount multi-year benefit therefore, anticipating headwind quantified roughly $40 million range. talked call earlier saw large accounts, surprising amount multiyear positively benefited q3 little $15 million revenue compared saw q3 year ago. so, much headwind expecting. obviously, 606 dynamics, things, especially large deal kind meaty chunky lumpy, try call sort help people understand, there's pretty healthy kind baseline flow, ea, also multiyear. see spikes, try call you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. want add, tyler, investing call ea business. first, starting investing search vector search community product. couple thing us. one, whenever anyone start mongodb open-source product, immediately get benefit complete highly integrated platform. two, capability migrate ea. so, ea u investment strategy. definitely see lot large customer very, committed running workload on-prem. even see customer want run run ai workload on-prem. so, optionality get using mongodb on-prem cloud, also cross-cloud compelling one. tyler radke -- analyst thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line brad reback stifel. line open. brad reback -- analyst great. thanks much. and, michael, best luck. great run. dev, started call talking bunch investments, great given growth business. obviously, talked reallocating expenses. net-net, think incremental investment phase next year gating margin upside? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer think that's something obviously ready talk next year now, would say -- reason looking invest summarize again, going up-market legacy app modernization see large workload potentially play ideal database genai apps, future important investment drive long-term growth. quite energized investment that's something high conviction on. brad reback -- analyst that's great. maap program, workload going wind atlas healthy combination ea atlas? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer think early days. would say -- would probably say side atlas ea early days. think introduce search vector search ea product, see on-prem. obviously, people use mongodb ai workload using technology well conjunction mongodb on-prem ai use cases. would say probably going see happen first atlas. brad reback -- analyst great. thanks much. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line jason ader william blair. line open. jason ader -- analyst yeah, thank you. going belabor congratulating michael, fun working best luck. question strength ea. think, dev, represents comment enterprise might rethinking reassessing kind on-prem versus cloud workload placement decision? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer well, think large enterprises, think large enterprise meaningful workload still running on-prem. think belief everything would go cloud probably something really popular good old day zurp. think customer assess investment already place, much judicious run workload think leverage existing investment infrastructure, going so. also bunch reason like regulatory reasons, customer quite moving aggressively cloud. see particularly europe, see lot european bank still running majority workload on-prem. also varies region conversely asia, seeing people much move much aggressively cloud. think really depends industry, geography, personal dynamic what's happening particular account. mean, see large u bank also committed running thing on-prem. really varies. that's feel really good run anywhere strategy give customer optionality. build something run on-prem. choose move cloud, easy mongodb. jason ader -- analyst right. follow-up also investment making strategic sale enterprise. could get little specific investment might be? hiring lot new salespeople? working sis, investing sis? additional detail would helpful. thanks. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. everyone's benefit, identified number accounts, call strategic accounts, think high upside us. seen number account grow quickly deploy right mix resources. necessarily quota-carrying resources. could additional technical sale resources, additional p resources, additional customer service resource better service support accounts. even thing like run education session developer accounts, called either hackathons like call developer day even design review meet development team looking build application, help think would potentially use mongodb build particular app. find many developers, experience mongodb quite limited, engage them, educate show simple easy is. like example, customer today think like use oltp database, search database, maybe vector database, like caching database. integrated mongodb. sudden, customer say, wow, simplify life, simplify back-end infrastructure, build app far quickly much easier manage long-term everything mongodb. really function educating power mongodb really open lot opportunity us. that's doubling down, mix resource really predicated accounts, quota counting resources, whole suite resource bringing table. jason ader -- analyst thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line andrew nowinski well fargo. line open. andrew nowinski -- analyst okay. good afternoon. thank much taking question congrats nice quarter. gave example customer migrated postgres think said issue pg vector function. wondering long customer using postgres decided make change mongo, meaning sort like rebound type customer chose pg -- excuse me, postgres work? frequently seeing type transition? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. can't give specific long using postgres, -- trend seeing business. remember postgres 40-year-old technology. -- beneficiary people lifting shifting type relational databases, oracle, sql server, mysql, et cetera. open-source database. part -- open-source relational database, inherent challenge relational database do. quite inflexible. build schema, hard change schema. hard scale hard distribute data. large data volumes, weird thing like, example, resort off-road storage large data objects, creates performance bottlenecks. again, people default postgres know anything better know relational everyone kind moving relational platforms. that's whole point saying earlier. educate developer flexibility schema, easily horizontally scale rich query language aggregation sophisticated geospatial indexes, productivity gain using document model easy organize data, -- people like, wow, life much easier. want clear, zero-sum game. postgres fail u successful. big market quite excited opportunity, see customer moving postgres coming mongodb. andrew nowinski -- analyst thank you. helpful. maybe quick follow-up. normalize $15 million multiyear deal impact q3, would ea still sequentially q4? thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer given level guidance, trying help understand context full-year number headwind talked beginning year, given strength saw q3. andrew nowinski -- analyst got it. thanks. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line raimo lenschow barclays. line open. raimo lenschow -- analyst hey, thank you. think ea strength quarter, michael, kind give u little bit there. like think renewal -- renewal situation renewal pool coming like q3, coming q4, et cetera, well like mean term upsell, cross-sell opportunity people think starting ai project self-serve, kind mentioned earlier call? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. think -- think ea q4, tends large renewal quarter, talking term guide strength multiyear, that's would expect see ea sequentially, typically pattern, called out. term ai workload things, think early tell obviously, continue evolve assess view get full-year guide march. also updated view cohort behaving sort multiyear played out. think term q4, comment made earlier hopefully help. raimo lenschow -- analyst yeah. okay, perfect. -- talk little bit like obviously, there's debate like database persistent layer ai projects, et cetera. see big hyperscalers term working guy partnerships? obviously aws kind summit, et-cetera. speak little bit like relationship big guy evolving around this? michael, best case talk you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. so, start partnership first, like -- aws, said, re:invent show last week. -- remains very, strong. closed ton deal past quarter. very, large deals. integration new product like q bedrock engagement field really strong. azure, think -- shared past, start-off little bit slow start, word person run partner leadership, azure mongodb relationship never stronger. closed large number deals. part what's called azure native ic service program bunch deep integration azure, including fabric, power bi, visual studio, semantic kernel, azure openai studio. also one azure's largest marketplace partners. gcp -- actually seen uptick term co-sales done past quarter gcp made comp change -- favorable working mongodb saw result field, focused closing -- closing handful large deal gcp q4. general, would say, thing going quite well. term of, guess, implying question like hyperscalers potentially bundling thing along ai offerings? mean, candidly, since day one, hyperscalers bundling database offering every offering that's predominant strategy. -- think executed well strategy database like by-the-way decision. important decision. think hyperscalers seeing performance realize better partner us. said, customer understand importance data layer, especially ai applications. partnership across three hyperscalers strong. raimo lenschow -- analyst ok, perfect. thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer thanks, raimo. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line brad sill bank america. line open. brad sill -- analyst great. thank much, congratulations, michael, next move. wanted ask new workload vector search, stream processing, relational migrator. one three that's ramping faster maybe expected? little bit color new workload type ramping. thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. kind give rundown -- mean, essentially asking new products, like -- search, introduced new capability called atlas search nodes, asymmetrically scale search node search-intensive use case, scale node become quite expensive. seen kind groundbreaking capability really well received. demand quite high customer like tune configuration unique need search requirements. one world's largest bank using atlas search provide like google-like search experience payment data massive corporate customers. customer-facing application performance, scalability critical. leading provider ai-powered accounting software us atlas search power invoice analytics future, allows end user finance team perform ad-hoc analysis easily find past-due invoice voice contain errors. search -- vector search, -- again, kind first full-year since going generally available. product uptake actually very, high. q3, released quantization atlas vector search, reduces memory requirement 96%, allowing u support larger vector workload vastly improved price performance. example, multinational news organization created genai powered tool designed help producer journalist efficiently search, summarize, verify information vast varied data sources. leading security firm using atlas vector search fight ai fraud leading global medium company replaced elastic search hybrid search vector search use case user recommendation engine that's built suggest -- that's built suggest article end users. that's super exciting see well. also seeing lot interest streaming product, demand high. rolled another hyperscaler, customer commenting use case able embed stream processing mongodb make life much easier. overall, quite pleased progress making new products. said before, natively bundling capability really reduces eliminates need customer bolt bunch different technology solve problem, saving lot time, money, cost, risk. brad sill -- analyst that's really exciting. thanks, dev. wanted ask question around cedric's appointment. focus may different leadership thinking going forward? thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer no, cedric cro for, gosh, like think like five, six years, -- interim cro three quarter took last made change really expansion responsibilities. known cedric long time. worked multiple different companies. think good barometer understanding sale leadership. there's number sale leader worked top-tier software company used work me. super-excited role cedric going take also making change cedric better align different organization tightly work together going up-market, app monetization positioning well ideal database genai apps. brad sill -- analyst super exciting. thanks, dev. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer thanks, brad. operator thank you. one moment next question, please. next question coming line mike cikos needham company. line open. mike cikos -- analyst hey guys, thanks taking question here. wanted come back consumption growth slightly better expectation second quarter row now. apology missed it, improvement seeing, across vintage geography potentially concentrated scope? trying get better understanding what's seeking place what's embedded guide. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. no, would describe broad-based, mike. obviously, pleased see continuing monitoring slicing dicing different ways. information insight you, share it. without trying throw whole bunch cold water mind, slightly better, step-function changed better, good see. mike cikos -- analyst terrific. maybe quick follow-up dev. think build maybe tyler's question top q&a, cited customer thinking workload holistically even looking run ai workload on-prem. much think function customer still trying figure optimize latency cost demonstration really early phase exploratory phase versus going production? way coarse two necessarily connected? thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer no, think kind little bit both. think customer committed running big part estate on-prem. definition, going build ai workload, run on-prem, mean also need access gpus that. customer leveraging basically renting gpus cloud provider building ai workloads. think very, early days. still learning, experimenting. more-and-more apps entering production. said prepared remarks, thousand workload -- ai workload running mongodb, small percentage demonstrated meaningful product market fit. initial traction kind still small. think people get sophisticated ai, ai technology matures becomes useful, think application -- start seeing application take-off. kind chuckled today see senior leader bragging chip using versus apps building. tell still very, early day big platform shift. mike cikos -- analyst great point. thank again, guys. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, mike. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line eric heath keybanc. line open. eric heath -- analyst hi, thanks taking question. dev, michael, sound like takeaway call greater focus ea enterprise. structurally rethink ea business differently think healthy double-digit growth business going forward foreseeable future? could ask follow-up question separate that. michael, understand still early identify fiscal '25 cohort workloads, curious high-level look feel like higher quality fiscal '24 cohort workflow. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer want take first one term ea... michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, mean, would say, mean, committed run anywhere strategy. said, first investing community many customer first way experience mongodb. want full experience integrating search vector search core product. gate really start building applications. transition building capability ea. so, clearly investing ea product. atlas still big, big part business big, big part growth engine typically launch new feature atlas capability already have, fact multi-cloud make very, compelling offering many customers. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. think term workloads, think early. reminder folks, tend start small, although grow quickly. think thing add is, pretty consistent pleased new business done. need time let cohort play track them.

Welcome to the MongoDB third-quarter fiscal year 2025 conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there'll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your speaker for today, Brian Denyeau. Please go ahead. Brian Raferty Denyeau -- Investor Relations Thank you, Lisa. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today to review MongoDB's third-quarter fiscal 2025 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued after the close of the market today. Joining me the call today are Dev Ittycheria, president and CEO of MongoDB; and Michael Gordon, MongoDB's COO and CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our market and future growth opportunities, our expectations for the macroeconomic environment in fiscal 2025 and the impact of AI, the benefits of our product platform, our competitive landscape, customer behaviors, our financial guidance, and our planned investments in growth opportunities in AI. These statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including the results of operations and financial condition that cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. For a discussion of the material risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please refer to the risks described in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 31st, 2024 that we filed with the SEC on August 30th, 2024. Any forward-looking statements made on this call reflect our views only as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them except as required by law. Additionally, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures on this conference call. Please refer to the tables in our earnings release in the Investor Relations portion of our website for a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dev. Dev? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we had a strong quarter of new business and executed well against our large market opportunity. Let's begin by reviewing our third quarter results before giving you a broader company update. We generated revenue of $529 million, a 22% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew 26% year-over-year, representing 68% of total revenue. We generated non-GAAP operating income of $101 million for a 19% non-GAAP operating margin and we ended the quarter with over 52,600 customers. Overall, we were pleased with our performance in the third quarter. We had a strong new business quarter and we're happy with our new workload acquisition on Atlas. Our non-Atlas business significantly exceeded expectations in part because we benefited from a few large multi-year deals as customers continue to value our run anywhere strategy and want to build a deeper longer-term relationship with MongoDB. Atlas consumption was slightly better than expected in a macro-environment that we would characterize as largely consistent with what we saw in the first half of the year. Michael will cover consumption trends in more detail. Retention rates remained strong in Q3, demonstrating the mission criticality of our platform. On our Q1 earnings call, we shared with you the three major strategic initiatives that we believe will enable us to maximize our long-term opportunity. I want to give you an update on the progress we're making on those initiatives. First, we are increasing our investment in the enterprise channel since we see the strongest returns in this part of the market. Specifically, we're expanding our strategic account program going to next year, as we see more accounts that will benefit from incremental investment. In addition, we're investing time and resources to educate developers in large enterprise accounts and uplevel their MongoDB skills. These organizations have thousands of developers and as we penetrate them more deeply, we encounter developers who have historically only built SQL applications and simply do not know how to use MongoDB to its full potential. In our experience, educating these developers on the benefits of MongoDB drives significant incremental adoption of our platform. To fund these up-market investments, we are reallocating a portion of our mid-market investments. The mid-market remains an attractive opportunity for us, but we believe that prioritizing investment up-market will deliver strong returns in the current environment. We also believe there are additional ways to serve the mid-market more efficiently through our self-serve channel and other scaled technology-enabled sales and customer service motions. Second, we are optimistic about the opportunity to accelerate legacy app modernization using AI and are investing more in this area. As you recall, we ran a few successful pilots earlier this year, demonstrating that AI tooling combined with professional services and our relational migrator product can significantly reduce the time, cost, and risk of migrating legacy applications onto MongoDB. While it's early days, we have observed a more than 50% reduction in the cost to modernize. On the back of these strong early results, additional customer interest is exceeding our expectations. Large enterprises in every industry and geography are experiencing acute pain from their legacy infrastructure and are eager for more agile, performant, and cost-effective solutions. Not only are customers excited to engage with us, they also want to focus on some of the most important applications in their enterprise, further demonstrating the level of interest and size of the long-term opportunity. As relational applications encompass a wide variety of database types, programming languages, versions, and other customer-specific variables, we expect modernization projects to continue to include meaningful service engagements in the short and medium term. Consequently, we're increasing our professional services delivery capabilities, both directly and through partners. In the long run, we expect to automate and simplify large parts of the modernization process. To that end, we are leveraging the learnings from early service engagement to develop new tools to accelerate future modernization efforts. Although it's early days and scaling our legacy app modernization capabilities will take time, we have increased conviction that this motion will significantly add to our growth in the long term. Third, we are investing to capitalize on our inherent technical advantages as a key component of the emerging AI tech stack. As a reminder, MongoDB is uniquely equipped to query rich and complex data structures typical of AI applications. The ability of a database to query rich and complex data structures is crucial because AI applications often rely on highly detailed, interrelated, and nuanced data to make accurate predictions and decisions. For example, a recommendation system doesn't just analyze a single customer's purchase but also considers their browsing history, peer group behavior, and product categories requiring a database that can query and interlink these complex data structures. In addition, MongoDB's architecture unifies source data, metadata, operational data, and vector data in an all-in-one platform, updating the need for multiple database systems and complex back-end architectures. This enables a more compelling developer experience than any other alternative. From what we see in the AI market today, most customers are still in the experimental stage as they work to understand the effectiveness of the underlying tech stack and build early proof-of-concept applications. However, we are seeing an increasing number of AI apps in production. Today, we have thousands of AI apps on our platform. What we don't yet see is many of these apps actually achieving meaningful product market fit and therefore significant traction. In fact, as you take a step back and look at the entire universe of AI apps, a very small percentage of them have achieved the type of scale that we commonly see with enterprise-specific applications. We do have some AI apps that are growing quickly, including one that is already a seven-figure workload that has grown 10 times since the beginning of the year. Similar to prior platform shifts as the usefulness of AI tech improves and becomes more cost-effective, we will see the emergence of many more AI apps that do nail product market fit, but it's difficult to predict when that will happen more broadly. We remain confident that we will capture our fair share of these successful AI applications as we see that our platform is popular with developers building more sophisticated AI use cases. We continue investing in our product capabilities, including enterprise-grade Atlas Vector Search functionality to build on this momentum and even better position MongoDB to capture the AI opportunity. In addition, as previously announced, we are bringing search and vector service to our community and EA offerings, leveraging our run anywhere competitive advantage in the world of AI. Finally, we are expanding our MongoDB AI applications program or MAAP, which helps enterprise customers build and bring AI applications into production by providing them with reference architectures, integrations with leading tech providers, and coordinated services and support. Last week, we announced a new code of partners including McKinsey, Confluent, Capgemini, and Unstructured, as well as the collaboration with Meta to enable developers to build AI-enriched applications on MongoDB using Llama. Next, I'd like to provide you with a brief product update. At our dot local developer conference in London in October, we announced the general availability of MongoDB 8.0, the fastest and most performant version of MongoDB ever. MongoDB 8.0 performs 20% to 60% better against common industry benchmarks compared to our prior version and is built to exceed our customers' most stringent security, resiliency, availability, and performance requirements. To best serve our customers, we regularly review and reprioritize investments in our product portfolio to ensure we're allocating our resources to products with the highest demand from our customers. And to do that, we also deprecate products that are not showing results we desired. Consequently, we made the decision to consolidate our Atlas serverless offerings with our smallest dedicated tiers to create Atlas Flex customers, a new offering with a simpler architecture that provides the elasticity features akin to serverless. We will begin migrating effective customers to the single, simple, entry-level solution in Q4. We also decided to deprecate Atlas DeviceSync and other capabilities not widely adopted in order to focus our engineering resources on the core platform. While these reprioritization decisions are not made lightly, they allow us to deliver the most value to the largest number of customers, reinforcing our commitment to being the best modern database and helping us to grow faster. Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the adoption trends of MongoDB across our customer base. Customers across industries and around the world are running mission-critical projects in MongoDB Atlas, leveraging the full power of our developer data platform, including Financial Times, CarGurus, and Victoria's Secret. As part of the digital transformation journey, global specialty retailer Victoria's Secret & Company migrated its e-commerce platform to MongoDB Atlas. As a fully managed platform, MongoDB Atlas allowed the company to simplify its architecture and improve performance, supporting the retailer to provide a resilient, secure, and fast web and mobile e-commerce experience for their millions of customers around the world. Allianz, Alphamad, Swiss Post, and Paylocity are turning to MongoDB to modernize applications. Paylocity, a leading provider of cloud-based payroll and human capital management software, selected MongoDB to power proprietary application aimed at fostering employee connections and engagement. When traffic increased and the original SQL-based solution was unable to keep up with the required performance metrics, Paylocity migrated to MongoDB Atlas to take advantage of the flexible schema architecture, performance, and scalability. MongoDB costs five times less than the previous SQL database solution and the company's developers can now create an application within minutes, something that used to take weeks. Mature companies and start-ups alike are using MongoDB to help deliver the next wave of AI-powered application to customers, including NerdWallet, Cisco, and Tealbook. Tealbook, a supplier intelligence platform, migrated from Postgres, pgvector, and ElasticSearch to MongoDB to eliminate technical debt and consolidate their tech stack. The company experienced workload isolation and scalability issues in pgvector and were concerned with the search index inconsistencies, which were all resolved with the migration to MongoDB. With Atlas Vector search and dedicated search nodes, Tealbook has realized improved cost-efficiency and increased scalability for the supplier data platform, an application that uses GenAI to collect, verify, and enrich supplier data across various sources. In summary, we had a healthy Q3 with both Atlas and EA exceeding expectations. We saw a strong new business quarter and we remain confident in our ability to become an increasing strategic provider in our large and growing market. Looking forward, we see a great opportunity to grow our adoption in the enterprise through new workloads, modernizing legacy applications, and winning the next generation of AI-powered applications. I would like to finish by providing an update on our senior leadership. First, as we announced early in the press release, after nearly 10 years, Michael Gordon has made the decision to leave MongoDB. Michael has been instrumental in MongoDB's success over the past decade, leading our successful IPO, helping us grow our revenue nearly 50-fold, and scaling -- and successfully scaling our business model to generate meaningful operating leverage. He has been a trusted advisor and business partner to the Board and me over the years and also has become a personal friend. Michael is excited to take a well-deserved break. We have commenced the search for Michael's replacement and will be evaluating both internal and external candidates. One of Michael's proudest compliments -- accomplishments has been building a world-class finance team under his leadership, and I'm confident that we will not miss a beat during this transition. Michael will continue to serve as CFO through January 31st to help us finish the fiscal year and then will transition to an Advisor to the company to ensure a seamless process. If we have not named Michael's successor by fiscal year-end, Serge Tanjga, SVP of Finance, will serve as Interim CFO, beginning on February 1st. Second, we are promoting Cedric Pech, currently our chief revenue officer to the newly created role of president worldwide field operations. In this new position, Cedric will oversee all our field-based customer-facing and go-to-market enablement teams, including professional services. We believe this org structure will best enable us to execute on some of the key strategic initiatives I discussed earlier, in particular, our increased focus on up-market and the app monetization opportunity. I would like to congratulate Cedric on this well-deserved promotion. With that, let me turn the call over to Michael. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Dev, and thanks for the kind words and our incredible partnership over the past decade. The past 10 years have been the most rewarding in my professional career and I'm extremely proud of what we've achieved together and of course, to the whole MongoDB team. With as much success as we had, I still believe that MongoDB is in the early stages of realizing its full potential as it continues to take share in one of the largest markets in software. Now, turning to the results for the quarter. I'll begin with a detailed review of our third-quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025. First, I'll start with our third quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $529.4 million, up 22% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance. Shifting to our product mix, Atlas grew 26% in the quarter compared to the previous year and now represents 68% of total revenue compared to 66% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and 71% last quarter. We recognized Atlas revenue primarily based on customer consumption of our platform and that consumption is closely tied to end user activity of their applications. Let me provide some context on Atlas consumption in the quarter. In Q3, consumption was slightly ahead of our expectations. This year's Q3 seasonal improvement was more muted than in years past as expected. On a year-over-year basis, consumption growth remains below that of prior year period. Turning to non-Atlas revenue. Non-Atlas came in significantly ahead of our expectations. As Dev mentioned, EA new business was strong, and we continue to have success selling incremental workloads into our existing customer base. In addition, our Q3 non-Atlas revenue benefited from a few large multi-year deals. As you know, due to ASC 606, we recognized the entire term license component of a multi-year contract at the start of that contract. Compared to Q3 of last year, the multi-year license component of non-Atlas revenues was over $15 million higher. Turning to customer growth. During the third quarter, we grew our customer base by approximately 1,900 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 52,600, which is up from over 46,400 in the year-ago period. Of our total customer count, over 7,400 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 6,900 in the year-ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven primarily by Atlas, which had over 51,100 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 44,900 in the year-ago period. It is important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers adding their first Atlas workload. Continuing on, in Q3, our net ARR expansion rate was approximately 120%. We ended the quarter with 2,314 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, up from $1,972 in the year-ago period. Moving down the income statement, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the third quarter was $405.7 million, representing a gross margin of 77%, which is flat versus the year-ago period. Our income from operations was $101.5 million or 19% operating margin for the third quarter compared to an 18% operating margin in the year-ago period. The primary reason for more favorable operating income results versus guidance is our revenue outperformance, including the very high margin multi-year license revenue benefit. Net income in the third quarter was $98.1 million or $1.16 per share, based on 84.2 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a net income of $79.1 million or $0.96 per share on 83.7 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding in the year-ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the third quarter with $2.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $37.4 million. After taking into consideration approximately $2.9 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was $34.6 million in the quarter. This compares to free cash flow of $35 million in the year-ago period. In Q3, we did not incur capital expenditures to purchase IPV4 addresses as we previously expected, but we did start making those purchases in November and still expect a total outlay of $20 million to $25 million this fiscal year as we previously communicated. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $515 million to $519 million. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $55 million to $58 million and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.65 based on 84.9 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. For the full-fiscal year 2025, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.973 billion to $1.977 billion, non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $242 million to $245 million, and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $3.01 to $3.03 based on 84 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. Note that the non-GAAP net income per share guidance for the fourth-quarter and full-fiscal year 2025 includes a non-GAAP tax provision of approximately 20%. I'll now provide some more context around our updated guidance. First, in terms of Atlas consumption, we expect to see a typical seasonal slowdown in Q4, driven by underlying application usage moderating during the holiday season. Second, since Atlas consumption remained lower on a year-over-year basis in Q3, we expect to see continued deceleration of Atlas year-over-year growth in Q4. Third, we expect to see a sequential decline in non-Atlas revenue in Q4, which is contrary to our normal pattern. The reason for this is that we experienced a significant additional benefit from multi-year deals in Q3, which we do not expect to recur in Q4. In addition, I want to provide some incremental color on some of our recent product and -- how some of our recent product and go-to-market changes will impact the growth of our reported customer count going forward. First, as Dev explained, we are reallocating a portion of our go-to-market resources from the mid-market to the enterprise channel. As a result, we expect to see significantly fewer mid-market direct sales customer net additions and as a result, slower direct sales customer growth going forward. We believe this reallocation of investment dollars will drive higher revenue growth over time. So, it's a trade-off that makes sense. Second, as we introduce Atlas Flex clusters in Q4 and automatically migrate customers in Q1, we expect to see a one-time negative impact to our customer count since we have approximately 4,000 serverless customers who are very low spending and we do not expect them to transition over to Flex. These customers have a negligible impact on our revenue but will impact our reported customer count. To summarize, we're pleased with our third quarter results and especially our ability to win new business. We have a small share in one of the largest and fastest-growing markets in all of software with a number of secular tailwinds, including AI at our back. We'll continue investing judiciously and focusing on our execution to capture this long-term opportunity. With that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator? Questions & Answers: Operator [Operator instructions] Our first question for the day will be coming from Sanjit Singh of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Thank you for taking the questions and congrats, Michael, on outstanding career. You had an absolutely fantastic run at MongoDB. I'm excited to see what you do next, or excited if you just take a breather. So congrats, Michael. I guess to take the question -- to start off with the questions, when we look at what Atlas has been doing in the past two quarters, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think consumption is coming in at least modestly ahead of your expectations. Relative to what we've seen at the beginning of the year, what sort of -- is it a function of sales execution? Is it a function of the end-user activity sort of improving? What's driving at least the improvement in Atlas consumption in the past two quarters? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So a few different things. So I think if you look at our outlook at the beginning of the year, we had indicated that we thought we would see stable Atlas growth from a consumption standpoint. What we've seen and what we've talked about is -- we've actually seen lower year-over-year growth based on the underlying consumption. And so -- and that's incorporated into our Q4 guide. We have seen the Q3 and Q4 be -- sorry, Q2 and Q3, excuse me, be better than our expectations, but it's still down on a year-over-year basis. And so I want to make sure that we're not sort of confusing the comparative set of year-over-year versus relative to our expectations. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Understood. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer And the core of it, Sanjit, to your question is really the underlying usage of the applications. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Yeah, that makes total sense. And then, Dev, I have to ask you the AI agent question. In terms of an AI agent needing more context, it has going to have a set of tools to take its actions. What does it mean for MongoDB as an operational data store as customers start to roll out more agentic applications? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, just to talk about agents, I think when you think about agents, there's jobs, there's -- sorry, there's a job, there's projects and then there's task. Right now, the agents that are being rolled out are really focused on task like say something from Sierra or some other companies are rolling out agents. But you're right, what they deemed to do is to deal with being able to create a rich and complex data structures. Now why is this important for AI is that AI models don't just look at isolated data points, but they need to understand relationships, hierarchies, and patterns within the data. They need to be able to essentially get real-time insights. For example, if you have a chatbot where someone is querying, a customer is kind of trying to get some update on the order they placed five minutes ago because they may have not gotten any confirmation, your chatbot needs to be able to deal with real-time information. You need to be able to deal with basically handling very advanced use cases, understanding like, to do things like fraud detection to understand behaviors of supply chains, you need to understand intricate data relationships. All these things are consistent with MongoDB offers. And so we believe that at the end of the day, we are well-positioned to handle this. And the other thing that I would say is that we've embedded in a very natural way of search and vector search. So we're just not an OLTP database, we do tech search and vector search. That's all one experience and no other platform offers that, and we think we have a real advantage. And so we're integrated with the leading AI frameworks and platforms. We have enterprise-grade security and compliance, and customers can run us anywhere, either on 118 cloud regions or on-prem, and that again is a huge differentiator for us. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Awesome. Appreciate the thoughts, Dev. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Sanjit. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Taylor -- Tyler Radke of Citi. Your line is open. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Hi, thank you very much for taking the question. And, Michael, all the best, and congratulations on 10 years. Going back to the sales execution, I mean, one of the things that you talked about earlier this year was some challenges just in terms of the recently acquired workloads ramping. And I think a lot of those were from the past fiscal year. So curious how the quality of workload acquisition has trended this year. And as you think about the ramp in consumption potential into next year, how does that sort of look versus this time a year ago? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Maybe I'll just talk about what we're doing and the changes we made and then Michael can talk a little bit about the consumption trends. So, we did make some changes at the beginning of the year, and we really wanted to focus on both the volume and the quality of the workloads and there were some slight adjustments that we made. We think those changes are having a reasonable positive impact. Again, it's too early to declare victory because these workloads usually start small and grow over time, but we're really pleased with the results we're seeing so far. And -- but again, it's early days. And obviously, we'll know about the fiscal '25 workloads as we go into fiscal '26. But so far, so good. Michael, on consumption? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, just a couple of things, and thanks, Tyler. The fiscal '24 cohorts that we called out earlier, that slower growth does continue. They've been in line with our revised expectations. We made some changes that we talked about at the -- earlier in the year that should affect the fiscal '25 cohorts, but it's just too early to tell. On those, we need a few more quarters of data before you can really see if we're -- how we're seeing those behave differently. I will say we've talked about the new business environment and our success in new business. We have been pleased with that, but that just shows kind of the initial piece, and we need to see how they grow and how those cohorts evolve. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Great. Thanks. And follow-up on the EA side, you talked about the outsized strength in non-Atlas business this quarter. Maybe if you could unpack like the relative upside that was driven by simply duration versus new business. I know you called out the duration impact year-over-year, but are -- do you feel like this was sort of a one-off or do you feel like maybe some of your bigger customers are indexing more toward EA and how does that impact the way you think about the product and introducing things like vector search and stream processing onto the on-prem product? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, thank you. So overall, we continue to find the EA product resonate with customers. It's an important part of the run anywhere strategy and we've continued to see success with that and people wanting to increase their investment in MongoDB. There's always been a multiyear component and we continue to see that. We talked about that at the beginning of the year as to how fiscal '24 had an abnormally high amount of multi-year benefit and therefore, we were anticipating that being a headwind and we quantified that in roughly the $40 million range. What we talked about on this call earlier is we saw from a few large accounts, a surprising amount of multiyear that positively benefited Q3 at a little more than $15 million in revenue compared to what we saw Q3 a year ago. So, not as much of a headwind as we had been expecting. Obviously, with the 606 dynamics, some of these things, especially for a large deal can be kind of meaty and chunky and lumpy, which is why we try and call it out and sort of help people understand, but there's a pretty healthy kind of baseline flow, not just of EA, but also of multiyear. And when we see spikes, we just try and call it out for you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I just want to add, Tyler, that we are investing in our what we call our EA business. First, we're starting by investing with search and vector search and a community product. That does a couple of things for us. One, whenever anyone starts with MongoDB with the open-source product, they immediately get all the benefits of that complete highly integrated platform. Two, those capabilities will then migrate to EA. So, EA for us is an investment strategy. We definitely see lots of large customers who are very, very committed to running workloads on-prem. We even see some customers want to run to run AI workloads on-prem. So, the optionality they get by using MongoDB to not just be on-prem and the cloud, but also cross-cloud is a very compelling one. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Brad Reback of Stifel. Your line is open. Brad Reback -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. And, Michael, best of luck. It's been a great run. Dev, you started the call talking about a bunch of investments, which are great given the growth of the business. And obviously, you talked about reallocating some expenses. But net-net, should we think about this incremental investment phase next year as gating margin upside? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think that's something that we obviously are not ready to talk about next year just now, but I would say that we -- the reason we're looking to invest and just to summarize again, going up-market on legacy app modernization where we see very large workloads potentially at play and being the ideal database for GenAI apps, which is the future as important investments to drive long-term growth. And we're quite energized by those investments and that's something that we have high conviction on. Brad Reback -- Analyst That's great. And then on the MAAP program, are most of those workloads going to wind up in Atlas or will that be a healthy combination of EA and Atlas? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think it's again early days. I would say -- I would probably say more on the side of Atlas and EA in the early days. I think once we introduce a search and vector search into the EA product, you'll see more of that on-prem. Obviously, people can use MongoDB for AI workloads using other technologies as well in conjunction with MongoDB for on-prem AI use cases. But I would say you're probably going to see that happen first in Atlas. Brad Reback -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Jason Ader of William Blair. Your line is open. Jason Ader -- Analyst Yeah, thank you. I'm not going to belabor congratulating Michael, but it has been it has been fun working with you and best of luck. The question I had is on the strength in EA. Do you think, Dev, it represents a comment on how enterprises might be rethinking or reassessing the kind of on-prem versus cloud workload placement decision? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Well, when I think about large enterprises, I think large enterprises have meaningful workloads that are still running on-prem. I think the belief that everything would go to the cloud was probably something that was really popular in the good old days of Zurp. But I think now as customers assess their investments that they already have in place, they're being much more judicious about where they run those workloads and if they think they can leverage their existing investments in their own infrastructure, then they're going to do so. Also for a bunch of other reasons like regulatory reasons, some customers are quite not moving as aggressively to the cloud. We see that in particularly in Europe, where we see a lot of the European banks still running majority of the workloads on-prem. So it also varies by region where conversely in Asia, we're seeing people much move much more aggressively to the cloud. So I think it really depends on industry, on geography, and on the personal dynamics of what's happening in that particular account. I mean, we see some large US banks are also very committed to running things on-prem. So it really varies. And that's why we feel really good about our run anywhere strategy because it gives customer optionality. They can build something and run on-prem. And if and when they choose to move to the cloud, it's very easy to do so with MongoDB. Jason Ader -- Analyst All right. And then just as a follow-up also on the investments you're making in strategic sales and enterprise. Could you just get a little more specific on what those investments might be? Is it hiring a lot of new salespeople? Is it working more with SIs, investing more in SIs? Any additional detail would be helpful. Thanks. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So just for everyone's benefit, we've identified a number of accounts, which we call strategic accounts, which we think that have high upside for us. We've seen a number of accounts that grow very quickly when we deploy the right mix of resources. Now they're all not necessarily quota-carrying resources. They could be additional technical sales resources, additional PS resources, additional customer service resources to better service and support those accounts. We even do things like run education sessions for developers of the accounts, they're called either hackathons or like what we call developer days or even design reviews where we'll meet with our development teams who are looking to build an application, help them think about how they would potentially use MongoDB to build that particular app. And what we find is that because many of these developers, the experience with MongoDB is quite limited, the more we can engage with them, the more we can educate them and the more we can show them how simple and easy it is. Like for example, most customers today think like they have to use an OLTP database, then a search database, maybe a vector database, and then like a caching database. And all that is integrated in MongoDB. So all of a sudden, customers can say, wow, I can simplify my life, simplify my back-end infrastructure, build this app far more quickly and it will be much more easier to manage long-term if I do everything on MongoDB. And it's really a function of just educating them on the power of MongoDB that really opens up a lot of opportunities for us. So that's why we're doubling down, and the mix of resources is really predicated on the accounts, but it's not just quota counting resources, it's the whole suite of resources that we're bringing to the table. Jason Ader -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Andrew Nowinski of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Okay. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking the question and congrats on a nice quarter. You gave an example of a customer that migrated off Postgres and I think you said they had issues with their PG vector function. I was wondering how long was that customer using Postgres before they decided to make a change to Mongo, meaning was this some sort of like a rebound type customer where they chose PG -- or excuse me, Postgres and it didn't work? And then how frequently are you seeing this type of transition? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So I can't give you the specifics on how long they were using Postgres, but this is not -- this is a trend that we're seeing in our business. You have to remember Postgres is a 40-year-old technology. It's -- and they have been the beneficiary of people lifting and shifting from other types of relational databases, Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, et cetera. And they're an open-source database. And but as part -- because they're an open-source and relational database, they have the same inherent challenges all relational databases do. They're quite inflexible. So once you build a schema, it's very hard to change the schema. It's hard to scale and hard to distribute data. And if you have large data volumes, you have to do weird things like, for example, resort to off-road storage for large data objects, which creates performance bottlenecks. And so again, people default to Postgres if they don't know anything better because all they know is relational and everyone is kind of moving off those other relational platforms. And that's the whole point I was saying earlier. Once we educate developers on the flexibility of schema, how easily or horizontally scale the rich query language where you can do aggregations and do sophisticated geospatial indexes, the productivity gains by using the document model and how easy is to organize data, it's -- people are just like, wow, life is so much easier. Now I want to be clear, this is not a zero-sum game. Postgres does not have to fail for us to be successful. It's a big market and we're quite excited about the opportunity, but we do see customers moving off Postgres and coming to MongoDB. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Thank you. That was very helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up. If we normalize the $15 million multiyear deal impact you had in Q3, would EA still be down sequentially in Q4? Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer We haven't given that level of guidance, but just trying to help you understand in the context of the full-year numbers and the headwind that we talked about at the beginning of the year, just given the strength that we saw in Q3. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Got it. Thanks. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. The next question will be coming from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst Hey, thank you. And if you think about the EA strength this quarter, Michael, you'd kind of give us a little bit there. Like how should we think about renewal -- the renewal situation renewal pool coming up like or that you had in Q3, coming up in Q4, et cetera, as well and then like what does it mean in terms of upsell, cross-sell opportunity as people think about starting AI projects by self-serve, as you kind of mentioned earlier on the call? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So I think about -- if you think about EA for Q4, it tends to be a large renewal quarter, but what we're talking about in terms of the guide is because we had such strength in multiyear, that's where we would expect to see our EA down sequentially, which is not typically our pattern, which is why we called it out. In terms of AI workloads and some of those other things, I think it's early to tell and obviously, we'll continue to evolve and assess our view when we get to the full-year guide in March. And then we'll also have an updated view on how the cohorts are behaving and sort of how multiyear played out. But I think in terms of Q4, the comments that I made earlier hopefully will help. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst Yeah. Okay, perfect. And then the -- and can you talk a little bit about like obviously, there's a debate of like which database will be the persistent layer if you do AI projects, et cetera. What do you see from the big hyperscalers in terms of working with you guys and partnerships? We obviously just have AWS kind of summit, et-cetera. Can you speak a little bit like how your relationship with those big guys is evolving around this? And Michael, All the best in case I don't talk to you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, I'll start with the partnerships first, like our -- with AWS, as you said, they just had their re:Invent show last week. Our -- it remains very, very strong. We've closed a ton of deals this past quarter. Some of them very, very large deals. We're doing integrations to some of the new products like Q and Bedrock and the engagement in the field has been really strong. On Azure, I think we -- as I've shared in the past, we start-off with a little bit of a slow start, but in the words of the person who runs their partner leadership, the Azure MongoDB relationship has never been stronger. We've closed a large number of deals. We're part of what's called the Azure native IC service program and have a bunch of deep integrations with Azure, including Fabric, Power BI, Visual Studio, Semantic Kernel, and Azure OpenAI Studio. And we're also one of Azure's largest marketplace partners. And GCP does -- we have actually seen some uptick in terms of co-sales that we've done this past quarter and GCP made some comp changes where they -- that were favorable to working with MongoDB that we saw some results in the field, and we're focused on closing on -- closing a handful of large deals with GCP in Q4. So in general, I would say, things are going quite well. And then in terms of, I guess, implying your question was like the hyperscalers and are they potentially bundling things along with their AI offerings? I mean, candidly, since day one, the hyperscalers have been bundling their database offerings with every offering that they have and that's been their predominant strategy. And we've -- I think we've executed well against strategy because databases are not like a by-the-way decision. It's an important decision. And I think the hyperscalers are seeing our performance and realize it's better to partner with us. And as I said, customers understand the importance of the data layer, especially for AI applications. And so the partnership across all three hyperscalers is strong. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst OK, perfect. Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Raimo. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. The next question will be coming from the line of Brad Sills of Bank of America. Your line is open. Brad Sills -- Analyst Great. Thank you so much, and congratulations, Michael, on your next move. I wanted to ask about new workloads here on vector search, stream processing, relational migrator. Is there any one of those three that's ramping faster than maybe you expected? Just a little bit of color on how those new workload types are ramping. Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I'll kind of give you just a rundown of some of the -- I mean, essentially you're asking about the new products, like our -- on search, we introduced a new capability called Atlas search nodes, which where you can asymmetrically scale your search nodes because if you have a search-intensive use case, you don't have to scale all your nodes because they have become quite expensive. And we've seen that this kind of groundbreaking capability really well received. The demand is quite high and because customers like they can tune the configuration to the unique needs of their search requirements. One of the world's largest banks is using Atlas Search to provide like a Google-like search experience on payments data for massive corporate customers. So this is a customer-facing application and so performance, and scalability are critical. A leading provider of AI-powered accounting software uses Atlas Search to power its invoice analytics future, which allows end users and finance teams to perform ad-hoc analysis and easily find past-due invoices and voices that contain errors. So that search -- on vector search, it -- again, and it's been our kind of our first full-year since going generally available. And the product uptake has been actually very, very high. In Q3, we released quantization for Atlas Vector Search, which reduces the memory requirements by up to 96%, allowing us to support larger vector workloads with vastly improved price performance. For example, a multinational news organization created a GenAI powered tool designed to help producers and journalists efficiently search, summarize, and verify information from vast and varied data sources. A leading security firm is using Atlas Vector Search to fight AI fraud and a leading global media company replaced elastic search with hybrid search and vector search use case for a user recommendation engine that's built to suggest -- that's built in to suggest articles to end users. And so that's super exciting to see as well. We're also seeing a lot of interest in our streaming product, demand is very high. We just rolled it out to another hyperscaler, and customers are commenting on that the use cases of being able to embed stream processing with MongoDB makes our life so much easier. So overall, we're quite pleased with the progress we're making on the new products. And as I said before, natively bundling all these capabilities really reduces or eliminates the need for customers to have to bolt on a bunch of different technologies to solve the same problem, saving them a lot of time, money, cost, and risk. Brad Sills -- Analyst That's really exciting. Thanks, Dev. And then I wanted to ask a question around Cedric's appointment. Any focus that may be different here under his leadership that we should be thinking about going forward? Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer No, Cedric has been our CRO for, gosh, now like I think like five, six years, and he -- I was the Interim CRO for about three quarters until he took over when we last made a change and this is really an expansion of his responsibilities. I've known Cedric for a long time. He and I have worked with at multiple different companies. I think I have a good barometer for understanding sales leadership. There's a number of sales leaders who worked at other top-tier software companies who used to work for me or with me. And so I'm super-excited by the role Cedric is going to take and then we're also making some changes under Cedric to better align the different organizations so that we can more tightly work together on going up-market, on app monetization and positioning ourselves well to be the ideal database for GenAI apps. Brad Sills -- Analyst Super exciting. Thanks, Dev. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Brad. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question, please. Our next question will be coming from the line of Mike Cikos of Needham and Company. Your line is open. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Hey guys, thanks for taking the question here. I just wanted to come back to the consumption growth being slightly better than expectations again for the second quarter in a row now. And apologies if I missed it, but this improvement that we're seeing, is this across all vintages and geographies or is it potentially more concentrated in scope? Just trying to get a better understanding of what's seeking place out there and what's embedded in the guide. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. No, I would describe it as broad-based, Mike. And obviously, we're pleased to see it and we're continuing monitoring and slicing and dicing it in different ways. And as we have information or insights to you, we'll share it. And without trying to throw a whole bunch of cold water on our mind, it was slightly better, or a step-function changed better, but good to see. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Terrific. And maybe for a quick follow-up for Dev. I think it builds off maybe Tyler's question at the top of the Q&A, but you had cited that some customers are thinking about their workloads more holistically and even looking to run AI workloads on-prem. How much of that do you think is just a function of customers are still trying to figure out how to optimize for latency and cost or is this more a demonstration of we really are in the early phases of the exploratory phase versus going into production? Is there any way to coarse that out or is the two not necessarily connected? Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer No, I think it's kind of a little bit of both. I think you have some customers who are very committed to running a big part of the estate on-prem. So by definition, then if they're going to build an AI workload, it has to be run on-prem, which means that they also need access to GPUs and they're doing that. And then other customers are leveraging basically renting GPUs from the cloud providers and building their own AI workloads. I do think we're in the very, very early days. They're still learning, experimenting. More-and-more apps are entering production. And as I said on the prepared remarks, we have thousands of workload -- AI workloads running on MongoDB, but a very small percentage of them have demonstrated meaningful product market fit. And so the initial traction is kind of still small. But I think as people get more sophisticated with AI, as the AI technology matures and becomes more and more useful, I think applications will -- you'll start seeing these applications take-off. I kind of chuckled that today I see more senior leaders bragging about the chips they're using versus the apps they're building. So it just tells you that we're still in the very, very early days of this big platform shift. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Great point. Thank you again, guys. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Mike. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Eric Heath of KeyBanc. Your line is open. Eric Heath -- Analyst Hi, thanks for taking the question. Dev, Michael, it sounds like the takeaway from the call is a greater focus on EA and on enterprise. So should we structurally rethink the EA business differently and think of this more as a healthy double-digit growth business going forward for the foreseeable future? And then if I could just ask a follow-up question separate to that. But Michael, I understand that it's still early to identify the fiscal '25 cohort of workloads, but just curious at a high-level if they look and feel like of higher quality than the fiscal '24 cohort of workflow. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Do you want to take on the first one in terms of EA... Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, I mean, I would say, I mean, we are very committed to our run anywhere strategy. And as I said, we are first investing in community where for many customers is the first way they experience MongoDB. And we want them to have the full experience of integrating search and Vector search into our core product. And so they can out of the gate really start building applications. That will then transition to building those capabilities into EA. So, we are clearly investing in the EA product. But Atlas is still a big, big part of our business and a big, big part of our growth engine and we typically launch new features on Atlas and because of the capabilities we already have, the fact it's multi-cloud makes it a very, very compelling offering for many customers. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. And I think in terms of the workloads, I do think it's early. Just as a reminder for folks, they tend to start small, although grow quickly. I think the only other thing that I can add is, we've been pretty consistent and that we've been pleased with the new business that we've done. But we need some time to let the cohorts play out as we track them. But I think like I said, we've been happy with the new business that we were winning. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of William Power of Baird. Your line is open. Brian Raferty Denyeau -- Investor Relations You there, William? William Power -- Analyst Sorry, yeah. Thank you. Dev, you had some encouraging comments on relational migrator. I wonder if you could just touch on what you think is driving the higher interest here. I mean, it sounds like AI is contributing and helping, but it'd be great to get some more color there because that still feels like obviously a meaningful long-term opportunity. And then maybe the second part of the question for Dev or Michael, just be great to get any other framework around the professional services investments. Any way to kind of think about quantification and timing of that? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So the reason we're so excited about the opportunity to go after legacy applications is that, one, it seems like there's a confluence of events happening. One is that the increasing cost and tax of supporting and managing these legacy apps are just going up enough. Second, for many customers who are in regulated industries, the regulators are calling their -- the fact that they're running on these legacy apps with systemic risk, so they can no longer kick the can down the road. Third, also because they no longer can kick the can around, some vendors are going end-of-life, so they have to make a decision to migrate those applications to a more modern tech stack. Fourth, because GenAI is so predicated on data and to build a competitive advantage, you need to leverage your proprietary data, people want to access that data and be able to do so easily. And so that's another reason for them to want to modernize. And then you also have people who built those applications who are retiring or just no longer in the firm, so it just creates more and more risk for the companies. Given all that, customers are incredibly interested in figuring out a way to easily and safely and securely migrate those -- off those applications. And we always could help them very easily move the data and map the schema from a relational schema to a document schema. The hardest part was essentially rewriting the application. Now with the advent of GenAI, you can now significantly reduce the time. One, you can use GenAI to analyze existing code. Two, you can use GenAI to reverse engineer tests to test what the code does. And then three, you can use GenAI to build new code and then users test it to ensure that the new code produces the same results as the old code. And so all that time and effort is suddenly cut in a meaningful way and that's suddenly creating a lot of interest from customers saying, my goodness. And if you're already on a relational app, moving to another relational app doesn't feel like modernization. So, the other advantage is that moving to MongoDB gives them a much more modern platform, a much more agile, flexible, performant, and scalable platform for their future needs. And that's why we're so excited. Again, it's early days. We've run a number of pilots that have gone well. We're in the process of working with some customers now in the migration process. This will take time because these are very, very complex applications. And actually, one thing I also mentioned was that they're not just going after -- saying go after some tertiary Tier 2 or Tier 3 application, they're saying, hey, we want you to look at some of our crown jewels because these are the apps that are most painful for us. So that's also very exciting. But again, this will take time, but we're very committed to this, and we think this is going to drive -- help us drive long-term -- meaningful long-term growth. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, Will. And to the last part of your question on the professional services investment, we're really building out that capacity in order to meet the demand that we're seeing relative to the opportunity. We're calling it in particular because it has a gross margin impact because that's where that will typically show up. And then maybe the last thing and it's probably obvious, but just to sort of underscore it is the reason we're doing this though is for the ARR, right, to drive the new workloads, the additional workloads over to MongoDB as part of that migration. And over time, as we've talked about before, we hope and expect to be able to leverage technology more and more, but at least initially and into the medium-term, there's going to be a healthy human/services component to that. Just wanted to sort of effectively telegraph that out to folks. William Power -- Analyst That's helpful. Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Will. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Rudy Kessinger of DA Davidson. Please go ahead. Rudy Kessinger -- Analyst Hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in here. I believe last quarter you said consumption growth slightly ahead of expectations. And while down slower year-over-year growth versus Q2 last year, the year-over-year growth did improve from Q1. And so, I guess I'm curious for Q3, could you make a comment in that same regard? Obviously, slower on a year-over-year basis than Q3 last year, but was it stable with year-over-year consumption growth in Q2 or better or worse? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Rudy, thanks for the question. We haven't specifically called that out relative to Q2. We did see a lower year-over-year growth as we called out. We did see a seasonal rebound. Usually Q3 is stronger than Q2 and we talked about how that was smaller than in the prior year. So hopefully, that will help you all triangulate. Rudy Kessinger -- Analyst Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. I believe it was on your Q4 call back in March. At that point, Dev, you said it would be at least another year until AI applications are being deployed at scale. It sounds like the commentary that some early large workloads, but out of the thousands, just not many that are at large scale. I guess, is your expectation now that maybe it's still at least another year until we're seeing broad AI application rollouts at scale? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I think a lot of it's a function of the what's happening in the R&D side of AI, right? So for example, today, we don't have a very compelling model designed for our phones, right, because today the phones don't have the computing horsepower to run complex models. So, you don't see a ton of very, very successful consumer apps besides, say, ChatGPT or Claude. So we don't -- we also don't see like hundreds of apps taking off like you saw kind of the first generation of like the Internet or the cloud era, right, or the mobile era. So like I think we're still in the early days of AI. And so while we see a lot of people building AI apps, a lot of them have kind of fairly rudimentary functionality. But I think that over time that's going to change. In fact, I know it will change. I just can't predict when that will happen. But where we do see apps having production, we are having traction, we're seeing them grow very, very quickly and we have a lot of them on our platform. It's just very few of them are really have meaningful. Operator Thank you. And that concludes today's Q&A session. I would like to go ahead and turn the call back over to Dev for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, everyone. I just wanted to say we're really pleased with our Q3 results with strong new business performance and revenue exceeding expectations both -- across both Atlas and EA. We're making the necessary investments to expand our enterprise channel where we see the largest opportunity to establish MongoDB as a standard and the strongest returns on our go-to-market investments. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the progress we're making on both accelerating legacy app modernization with AI as well as establishing ourselves as a standard of the emerging AI tech stack for greenfield AI applications. And last but not least, I would like to thank Michael again for his contributions over the past 10 years and wish him well. Thank you, everyone, and we'll talk to you soon.

let's begin reviewing third quarter result giving broader company update. generated revenue $529 million, 22% year-over-year increase high end guidance. atlas revenue grew 26% year-over-year, representing 68% total revenue. generated non-gaap operating income $101 million 19% non-gaap operating margin ended quarter 52,600 customers. overall, pleased performance third quarter. strong new business quarter happy new workload acquisition atlas. non-atlas business significantly exceeded expectation part benefited large multi-year deal customer continue value run anywhere strategy want build deeper longer-term relationship mongodb. atlas consumption slightly better expected macro-environment would characterize largely consistent saw first half year. michael cover consumption trend detail. retention rate remained strong q3, demonstrating mission criticality platform. q1 earnings call, shared three major strategic initiative believe enable u maximize long-term opportunity. want give update progress making initiatives. first, increasing investment enterprise channel since see strongest return part market. specifically, expanding strategic account program going next year, see account benefit incremental investment. addition, investing time resource educate developer large enterprise account uplevel mongodb skills. organization thousand developer penetrate deeply, encounter developer historically built sql application simply know use mongodb full potential. experience, educating developer benefit mongodb drive significant incremental adoption platform. fund up-market investments, reallocating portion mid-market investments. mid-market remains attractive opportunity us, believe prioritizing investment up-market deliver strong return current environment. also believe additional way serve mid-market efficiently self-serve channel scaled technology-enabled sale customer service motions. second, optimistic opportunity accelerate legacy app modernization using ai investing area. recall, ran successful pilot earlier year, demonstrating ai tooling combined professional service relational migrator product significantly reduce time, cost, risk migrating legacy application onto mongodb. early days, observed 50% reduction cost modernize. back strong early results, additional customer interest exceeding expectations. large enterprise every industry geography experiencing acute pain legacy infrastructure eager agile, performant, cost-effective solutions. customer excited engage us, also want focus important application enterprise, demonstrating level interest size long-term opportunity. relational application encompass wide variety database types, programming languages, versions, customer-specific variables, expect modernization project continue include meaningful service engagement short medium term. consequently, increasing professional service delivery capabilities, directly partners. long run, expect automate simplify large part modernization process. end, leveraging learning early service engagement develop new tool accelerate future modernization efforts. although early day scaling legacy app modernization capability take time, increased conviction motion significantly add growth long term. third, investing capitalize inherent technical advantage key component emerging ai tech stack. reminder, mongodb uniquely equipped query rich complex data structure typical ai applications. ability database query rich complex data structure crucial ai application often rely highly detailed, interrelated, nuanced data make accurate prediction decisions. example, recommendation system analyze single customer's purchase also considers browsing history, peer group behavior, product category requiring database query interlink complex data structures. addition, mongodb's architecture unifies source data, metadata, operational data, vector data all-in-one platform, updating need multiple database system complex back-end architectures. enables compelling developer experience alternative. see ai market today, customer still experimental stage work understand effectiveness underlying tech stack build early proof-of-concept applications. however, seeing increasing number ai apps production. today, thousand ai apps platform. yet see many apps actually achieving meaningful product market fit therefore significant traction. fact, take step back look entire universe ai apps, small percentage achieved type scale commonly see enterprise-specific applications. ai apps growing quickly, including one already seven-figure workload grown 10 time since beginning year. similar prior platform shift usefulness ai tech improves becomes cost-effective, see emergence many ai apps nail product market fit, difficult predict happen broadly. remain confident capture fair share successful ai application see platform popular developer building sophisticated ai use cases. continue investing product capabilities, including enterprise-grade atlas vector search functionality build momentum even better position mongodb capture ai opportunity. addition, previously announced, bringing search vector service community ea offerings, leveraging run anywhere competitive advantage world ai. finally, expanding mongodb ai application program maap, help enterprise customer build bring ai application production providing reference architectures, integration leading tech providers, coordinated service support. last week, announced new code partner including mckinsey, confluent, capgemini, unstructured, well collaboration meta enable developer build ai-enriched application mongodb using llama. next, like provide brief product update. dot local developer conference london october, announced general availability mongodb 8.0, fastest performant version mongodb ever. mongodb 8.0 performs 20% 60% better common industry benchmark compared prior version built exceed customers' stringent security, resiliency, availability, performance requirements. best serve customers, regularly review reprioritize investment product portfolio ensure allocating resource product highest demand customers. that, also deprecate product showing result desired. consequently, made decision consolidate atlas serverless offering smallest dedicated tier create atlas flex customers, new offering simpler architecture provides elasticity feature akin serverless. begin migrating effective customer single, simple, entry-level solution q4. also decided deprecate atlas devicesync capability widely adopted order focus engineering resource core platform. reprioritization decision made lightly, allow u deliver value largest number customers, reinforcing commitment best modern database helping u grow faster. now, like spend minute reviewing adoption trend mongodb across customer base. customer across industry around world running mission-critical project mongodb atlas, leveraging full power developer data platform, including financial times, cargurus, victoria's secret. part digital transformation journey, global specialty retailer victoria's secret & company migrated e-commerce platform mongodb atlas. fully managed platform, mongodb atlas allowed company simplify architecture improve performance, supporting retailer provide resilient, secure, fast web mobile e-commerce experience million customer around world. allianz, alphamad, swiss post, paylocity turning mongodb modernize applications. paylocity, leading provider cloud-based payroll human capital management software, selected mongodb power proprietary application aimed fostering employee connection engagement. traffic increased original sql-based solution unable keep required performance metrics, paylocity migrated mongodb atlas take advantage flexible schema architecture, performance, scalability. mongodb cost five time less previous sql database solution company's developer create application within minutes, something used take weeks. mature company start-ups alike using mongodb help deliver next wave ai-powered application customers, including nerdwallet, cisco, tealbook. tealbook, supplier intelligence platform, migrated postgres, pgvector, elasticsearch mongodb eliminate technical debt consolidate tech stack. company experienced workload isolation scalability issue pgvector concerned search index inconsistencies, resolved migration mongodb. atlas vector search dedicated search nodes, tealbook realized improved cost-efficiency increased scalability supplier data platform, application us genai collect, verify, enrich supplier data across various sources. summary, healthy q3 atlas ea exceeding expectations. saw strong new business quarter remain confident ability become increasing strategic provider large growing market. looking forward, see great opportunity grow adoption enterprise new workloads, modernizing legacy applications, winning next generation ai-powered applications. would like finish providing update senior leadership. first, announced early press release, nearly 10 years, michael gordon made decision leave mongodb. michael instrumental mongodb's success past decade, leading successful ipo, helping u grow revenue nearly 50-fold, scaling -- successfully scaling business model generate meaningful operating leverage. trusted advisor business partner board year also become personal friend. michael excited take well-deserved break. commenced search michael's replacement evaluating internal external candidates. one michael's proudest compliment -- accomplishment building world-class finance team leadership, confident miss beat transition. michael continue serve cfo january 31st help u finish fiscal year transition advisor company ensure seamless process. named michael's successor fiscal year-end, serge tanjga, svp finance, serve interim cfo, beginning february 1st. second, promoting cedric pech, currently chief revenue officer newly created role president worldwide field operations. new position, cedric oversee field-based customer-facing go-to-market enablement teams, including professional services. believe org structure best enable u execute key strategic initiative discussed earlier, particular, increased focus up-market app monetization opportunity. would like congratulate cedric well-deserved promotion. that, let turn call michael. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer thanks, dev, thanks kind word incredible partnership past decade. past 10 year rewarding professional career extremely proud achieved together course, whole mongodb team. much success had, still believe mongodb early stage realizing full potential continues take share one largest market software. now, turning result quarter. begin detailed review third-quarter result finish outlook fourth quarter full fiscal year 2025. first, start third quarter results. total revenue quarter $529.4 million, 22% year-over-year high end guidance. shifting product mix, atlas grew 26% quarter compared previous year represents 68% total revenue compared 66% third quarter fiscal 2024 71% last quarter. recognized atlas revenue primarily based customer consumption platform consumption closely tied end user activity applications. let provide context atlas consumption quarter. q3, consumption slightly ahead expectations. year's q3 seasonal improvement muted year past expected. year-over-year basis, consumption growth remains prior year period. turning non-atlas revenue. non-atlas came significantly ahead expectations. dev mentioned, ea new business strong, continue success selling incremental workload existing customer base. addition, q3 non-atlas revenue benefited large multi-year deals. know, due asc 606, recognized entire term license component multi-year contract start contract. compared q3 last year, multi-year license component non-atlas revenue $15 million higher. turning customer growth. third quarter, grew customer base approximately 1,900 customer sequentially, bringing total customer count 52,600, 46,400 year-ago period. total customer count, 7,400 direct sale customers, compare 6,900 year-ago period. growth total customer count driven primarily atlas, 51,100 customer end quarter compared 44,900 year-ago period. important keep mind growth atlas customer count reflects new customer mongodb addition existing ea customer adding first atlas workload. continuing on, q3, net arr expansion rate approximately 120%. ended quarter 2,314 customer least $100,000 arr annualized mrr, $1,972 year-ago period. moving income statement, discussing result non-gaap basis unless otherwise noted. gross profit third quarter $405.7 million, representing gross margin 77%, flat versus year-ago period. income operation $101.5 million 19% operating margin third quarter compared 18% operating margin year-ago period. primary reason favorable operating income result versus guidance revenue outperformance, including high margin multi-year license revenue benefit. net income third quarter $98.1 million $1.16 per share, based 84.2 million diluted weighted average share outstanding. compare net income $79.1 million $0.96 per share 83.7 million diluted weighted-average share outstanding year-ago period. turning balance sheet cash flow, ended third quarter $2.3 billion cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash. operating cash flow third quarter $37.4 million. taking consideration approximately $2.9 million capital expenditure principal repayment finance lease liabilities, free cash flow $34.6 million quarter. compare free cash flow $35 million year-ago period. q3, incur capital expenditure purchase ipv4 address previously expected, start making purchase november still expect total outlay $20 million $25 million fiscal year previously communicated. like turn outlook fourth quarter full fiscal year 2025. fourth quarter, expect revenue range $515 million $519 million. expect non-gaap income operation range $55 million $58 million non-gaap net income per share range $0.62 $0.65 based 84.9 million estimated diluted weighted-average share outstanding. full-fiscal year 2025, expect revenue range $1.973 billion $1.977 billion, non-gaap income operation range $242 million $245 million, non-gaap net income per share range $3.01 $3.03 based 84 million estimated diluted weighted-average share outstanding. note non-gaap net income per share guidance fourth-quarter full-fiscal year 2025 includes non-gaap tax provision approximately 20%. provide context around updated guidance. first, term atlas consumption, expect see typical seasonal slowdown q4, driven underlying application usage moderating holiday season. second, since atlas consumption remained lower year-over-year basis q3, expect see continued deceleration atlas year-over-year growth q4. third, expect see sequential decline non-atlas revenue q4, contrary normal pattern. reason experienced significant additional benefit multi-year deal q3, expect recur q4. addition, want provide incremental color recent product -- recent product go-to-market change impact growth reported customer count going forward. first, dev explained, reallocating portion go-to-market resource mid-market enterprise channel. result, expect see significantly fewer mid-market direct sale customer net addition result, slower direct sale customer growth going forward. believe reallocation investment dollar drive higher revenue growth time. so, trade-off make sense. second, introduce atlas flex cluster q4 automatically migrate customer q1, expect see one-time negative impact customer count since approximately 4,000 serverless customer low spending expect transition flex. customer negligible impact revenue impact reported customer count. summarize, pleased third quarter result especially ability win new business. small share one largest fastest-growing market software number secular tailwinds, including ai back. continue investing judiciously focusing execution capture long-term opportunity. that, like open questions. operator? question & answers: operator [operator instructions] first question day coming sanjit singh morgan stanley. line open. sanjit singh -- analyst thank taking question congrats, michael, outstanding career. absolutely fantastic run mongodb. excited see next, excited take breather. congrats, michael. guess take question -- start questions, look atlas past two quarters, correct wrong, think consumption coming least modestly ahead expectations. relative seen beginning year, sort -- function sale execution? function end-user activity sort improving? what's driving least improvement atlas consumption past two quarters? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. different things. think look outlook beginning year, indicated thought would see stable atlas growth consumption standpoint. seen talked -- actually seen lower year-over-year growth based underlying consumption. -- that's incorporated q4 guide. seen q3 q4 -- sorry, q2 q3, excuse me, better expectations, still year-over-year basis. want make sure sort confusing comparative set year-over-year versus relative expectations. sanjit singh -- analyst understood. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer core it, sanjit, question really underlying usage applications. sanjit singh -- analyst yeah, make total sense. then, dev, ask ai agent question. term ai agent needing context, going set tool take actions. mean mongodb operational data store customer start roll agentic applications? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. so, talk agents, think think agents, there's jobs, there's -- sorry, there's job, there's project there's task. right now, agent rolled really focused task like say something sierra company rolling agents. right, deemed deal able create rich complex data structures. important ai ai model look isolated data points, need understand relationships, hierarchies, pattern within data. need able essentially get real-time insights. example, chatbot someone querying, customer kind trying get update order placed five minute ago may gotten confirmation, chatbot need able deal real-time information. need able deal basically handling advanced use cases, understanding like, thing like fraud detection understand behavior supply chains, need understand intricate data relationships. thing consistent mongodb offers. believe end day, well-positioned handle this. thing would say embedded natural way search vector search. oltp database, tech search vector search. that's one experience platform offer that, think real advantage. integrated leading ai framework platforms. enterprise-grade security compliance, customer run u anywhere, either 118 cloud region on-prem, huge differentiator us. sanjit singh -- analyst awesome. appreciate thoughts, dev. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, sanjit. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line taylor -- tyler radke citi. line open. tyler radke -- analyst hi, thank much taking question. and, michael, best, congratulation 10 years. going back sale execution, mean, one thing talked earlier year challenge term recently acquired workload ramping. think lot past fiscal year. curious quality workload acquisition trended year. think ramp consumption potential next year, sort look versus time year ago? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. maybe talk change made michael talk little bit consumption trends. so, make change beginning year, really wanted focus volume quality workload slight adjustment made. think change reasonable positive impact. again, early declare victory workload usually start small grow time, really pleased result seeing far. -- again, early days. obviously, know fiscal '25 workload go fiscal '26. far, good. michael, consumption? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, couple things, thanks, tyler. fiscal '24 cohort called earlier, slower growth continue. line revised expectations. made change talked -- earlier year affect fiscal '25 cohorts, early tell. those, need quarter data really see -- seeing behave differently. say talked new business environment success new business. pleased that, show kind initial piece, need see grow cohort evolve. tyler radke -- analyst great. thanks. follow-up ea side, talked outsized strength non-atlas business quarter. maybe could unpack like relative upside driven simply duration versus new business. know called duration impact year-over-year, -- feel like sort one-off feel like maybe bigger customer indexing toward ea impact way think product introducing thing like vector search stream processing onto on-prem product? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah, thank you. overall, continue find ea product resonate customers. important part run anywhere strategy continued see success people wanting increase investment mongodb. there's always multiyear component continue see that. talked beginning year fiscal '24 abnormally high amount multi-year benefit therefore, anticipating headwind quantified roughly $40 million range. talked call earlier saw large accounts, surprising amount multiyear positively benefited q3 little $15 million revenue compared saw q3 year ago. so, much headwind expecting. obviously, 606 dynamics, things, especially large deal kind meaty chunky lumpy, try call sort help people understand, there's pretty healthy kind baseline flow, ea, also multiyear. see spikes, try call you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. want add, tyler, investing call ea business. first, starting investing search vector search community product. couple thing us. one, whenever anyone start mongodb open-source product, immediately get benefit complete highly integrated platform. two, capability migrate ea. so, ea u investment strategy. definitely see lot large customer very, committed running workload on-prem. even see customer want run run ai workload on-prem. so, optionality get using mongodb on-prem cloud, also cross-cloud compelling one. tyler radke -- analyst thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line brad reback stifel. line open. brad reback -- analyst great. thanks much. and, michael, best luck. great run. dev, started call talking bunch investments, great given growth business. obviously, talked reallocating expenses. net-net, think incremental investment phase next year gating margin upside? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer think that's something obviously ready talk next year now, would say -- reason looking invest summarize again, going up-market legacy app modernization see large workload potentially play ideal database genai apps, future important investment drive long-term growth. quite energized investment that's something high conviction on. brad reback -- analyst that's great. maap program, workload going wind atlas healthy combination ea atlas? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer think early days. would say -- would probably say side atlas ea early days. think introduce search vector search ea product, see on-prem. obviously, people use mongodb ai workload using technology well conjunction mongodb on-prem ai use cases. would say probably going see happen first atlas. brad reback -- analyst great. thanks much. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line jason ader william blair. line open. jason ader -- analyst yeah, thank you. going belabor congratulating michael, fun working best luck. question strength ea. think, dev, represents comment enterprise might rethinking reassessing kind on-prem versus cloud workload placement decision? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer well, think large enterprises, think large enterprise meaningful workload still running on-prem. think belief everything would go cloud probably something really popular good old day zurp. think customer assess investment already place, much judicious run workload think leverage existing investment infrastructure, going so. also bunch reason like regulatory reasons, customer quite moving aggressively cloud. see particularly europe, see lot european bank still running majority workload on-prem. also varies region conversely asia, seeing people much move much aggressively cloud. think really depends industry, geography, personal dynamic what's happening particular account. mean, see large u bank also committed running thing on-prem. really varies. that's feel really good run anywhere strategy give customer optionality. build something run on-prem. choose move cloud, easy mongodb. jason ader -- analyst right. follow-up also investment making strategic sale enterprise. could get little specific investment might be? hiring lot new salespeople? working sis, investing sis? additional detail would helpful. thanks. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. everyone's benefit, identified number accounts, call strategic accounts, think high upside us. seen number account grow quickly deploy right mix resources. necessarily quota-carrying resources. could additional technical sale resources, additional p resources, additional customer service resource better service support accounts. even thing like run education session developer accounts, called either hackathons like call developer day even design review meet development team looking build application, help think would potentially use mongodb build particular app. find many developers, experience mongodb quite limited, engage them, educate show simple easy is. like example, customer today think like use oltp database, search database, maybe vector database, like caching database. integrated mongodb. sudden, customer say, wow, simplify life, simplify back-end infrastructure, build app far quickly much easier manage long-term everything mongodb. really function educating power mongodb really open lot opportunity us. that's doubling down, mix resource really predicated accounts, quota counting resources, whole suite resource bringing table. jason ader -- analyst thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line andrew nowinski well fargo. line open. andrew nowinski -- analyst okay. good afternoon. thank much taking question congrats nice quarter. gave example customer migrated postgres think said issue pg vector function. wondering long customer using postgres decided make change mongo, meaning sort like rebound type customer chose pg -- excuse me, postgres work? frequently seeing type transition? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. can't give specific long using postgres, -- trend seeing business. remember postgres 40-year-old technology. -- beneficiary people lifting shifting type relational databases, oracle, sql server, mysql, et cetera. open-source database. part -- open-source relational database, inherent challenge relational database do. quite inflexible. build schema, hard change schema. hard scale hard distribute data. large data volumes, weird thing like, example, resort off-road storage large data objects, creates performance bottlenecks. again, people default postgres know anything better know relational everyone kind moving relational platforms. that's whole point saying earlier. educate developer flexibility schema, easily horizontally scale rich query language aggregation sophisticated geospatial indexes, productivity gain using document model easy organize data, -- people like, wow, life much easier. want clear, zero-sum game. postgres fail u successful. big market quite excited opportunity, see customer moving postgres coming mongodb. andrew nowinski -- analyst thank you. helpful. maybe quick follow-up. normalize $15 million multiyear deal impact q3, would ea still sequentially q4? thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer given level guidance, trying help understand context full-year number headwind talked beginning year, given strength saw q3. andrew nowinski -- analyst got it. thanks. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line raimo lenschow barclays. line open. raimo lenschow -- analyst hey, thank you. think ea strength quarter, michael, kind give u little bit there. like think renewal -- renewal situation renewal pool coming like q3, coming q4, et cetera, well like mean term upsell, cross-sell opportunity people think starting ai project self-serve, kind mentioned earlier call? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. think -- think ea q4, tends large renewal quarter, talking term guide strength multiyear, that's would expect see ea sequentially, typically pattern, called out. term ai workload things, think early tell obviously, continue evolve assess view get full-year guide march. also updated view cohort behaving sort multiyear played out. think term q4, comment made earlier hopefully help. raimo lenschow -- analyst yeah. okay, perfect. -- talk little bit like obviously, there's debate like database persistent layer ai projects, et cetera. see big hyperscalers term working guy partnerships? obviously aws kind summit, et-cetera. speak little bit like relationship big guy evolving around this? michael, best case talk you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. so, start partnership first, like -- aws, said, re:invent show last week. -- remains very, strong. closed ton deal past quarter. very, large deals. integration new product like q bedrock engagement field really strong. azure, think -- shared past, start-off little bit slow start, word person run partner leadership, azure mongodb relationship never stronger. closed large number deals. part what's called azure native ic service program bunch deep integration azure, including fabric, power bi, visual studio, semantic kernel, azure openai studio. also one azure's largest marketplace partners. gcp -- actually seen uptick term co-sales done past quarter gcp made comp change -- favorable working mongodb saw result field, focused closing -- closing handful large deal gcp q4. general, would say, thing going quite well. term of, guess, implying question like hyperscalers potentially bundling thing along ai offerings? mean, candidly, since day one, hyperscalers bundling database offering every offering that's predominant strategy. -- think executed well strategy database like by-the-way decision. important decision. think hyperscalers seeing performance realize better partner us. said, customer understand importance data layer, especially ai applications. partnership across three hyperscalers strong. raimo lenschow -- analyst ok, perfect. thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer thanks, raimo. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line brad sill bank america. line open. brad sill -- analyst great. thank much, congratulations, michael, next move. wanted ask new workload vector search, stream processing, relational migrator. one three that's ramping faster maybe expected? little bit color new workload type ramping. thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. kind give rundown -- mean, essentially asking new products, like -- search, introduced new capability called atlas search nodes, asymmetrically scale search node search-intensive use case, scale node become quite expensive. seen kind groundbreaking capability really well received. demand quite high customer like tune configuration unique need search requirements. one world's largest bank using atlas search provide like google-like search experience payment data massive corporate customers. customer-facing application performance, scalability critical. leading provider ai-powered accounting software us atlas search power invoice analytics future, allows end user finance team perform ad-hoc analysis easily find past-due invoice voice contain errors. search -- vector search, -- again, kind first full-year since going generally available. product uptake actually very, high. q3, released quantization atlas vector search, reduces memory requirement 96%, allowing u support larger vector workload vastly improved price performance. example, multinational news organization created genai powered tool designed help producer journalist efficiently search, summarize, verify information vast varied data sources. leading security firm using atlas vector search fight ai fraud leading global medium company replaced elastic search hybrid search vector search use case user recommendation engine that's built suggest -- that's built suggest article end users. that's super exciting see well. also seeing lot interest streaming product, demand high. rolled another hyperscaler, customer commenting use case able embed stream processing mongodb make life much easier. overall, quite pleased progress making new products. said before, natively bundling capability really reduces eliminates need customer bolt bunch different technology solve problem, saving lot time, money, cost, risk. brad sill -- analyst that's really exciting. thanks, dev. wanted ask question around cedric's appointment. focus may different leadership thinking going forward? thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer no, cedric cro for, gosh, like think like five, six years, -- interim cro three quarter took last made change really expansion responsibilities. known cedric long time. worked multiple different companies. think good barometer understanding sale leadership. there's number sale leader worked top-tier software company used work me. super-excited role cedric going take also making change cedric better align different organization tightly work together going up-market, app monetization positioning well ideal database genai apps. brad sill -- analyst super exciting. thanks, dev. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer thanks, brad. operator thank you. one moment next question, please. next question coming line mike cikos needham company. line open. mike cikos -- analyst hey guys, thanks taking question here. wanted come back consumption growth slightly better expectation second quarter row now. apology missed it, improvement seeing, across vintage geography potentially concentrated scope? trying get better understanding what's seeking place what's embedded guide. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. no, would describe broad-based, mike. obviously, pleased see continuing monitoring slicing dicing different ways. information insight you, share it. without trying throw whole bunch cold water mind, slightly better, step-function changed better, good see. mike cikos -- analyst terrific. maybe quick follow-up dev. think build maybe tyler's question top q&a, cited customer thinking workload holistically even looking run ai workload on-prem. much think function customer still trying figure optimize latency cost demonstration really early phase exploratory phase versus going production? way coarse two necessarily connected? thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer no, think kind little bit both. think customer committed running big part estate on-prem. definition, going build ai workload, run on-prem, mean also need access gpus that. customer leveraging basically renting gpus cloud provider building ai workloads. think very, early days. still learning, experimenting. more-and-more apps entering production. said prepared remarks, thousand workload -- ai workload running mongodb, small percentage demonstrated meaningful product market fit. initial traction kind still small. think people get sophisticated ai, ai technology matures becomes useful, think application -- start seeing application take-off. kind chuckled today see senior leader bragging chip using versus apps building. tell still very, early day big platform shift. mike cikos -- analyst great point. thank again, guys. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, mike. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line eric heath keybanc. line open. eric heath -- analyst hi, thanks taking question. dev, michael, sound like takeaway call greater focus ea enterprise. structurally rethink ea business differently think healthy double-digit growth business going forward foreseeable future? could ask follow-up question separate that. michael, understand still early identify fiscal '25 cohort workloads, curious high-level look feel like higher quality fiscal '24 cohort workflow. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer want take first one term ea... michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, mean, would say, mean, committed run anywhere strategy. said, first investing community many customer first way experience mongodb. want full experience integrating search vector search core product. gate really start building applications. transition building capability ea. so, clearly investing ea product. atlas still big, big part business big, big part growth engine typically launch new feature atlas capability already have, fact multi-cloud make very, compelling offering many customers. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. think term workloads, think early. reminder folks, tend start small, although grow quickly. think thing add is, pretty consistent pleased new business done. need time let cohort play track them. think like said, happy new business winning. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line william power baird. line open. brian raferty denyeau -- investor relation there, william? william power -- analyst sorry, yeah. thank you. dev, encouraging comment relational migrator. wonder could touch think driving higher interest here. mean, sound like ai contributing helping, great get color still feel like obviously meaningful long-term opportunity. maybe second part question dev michael, great get framework around professional service investments. way kind think quantification timing that? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. reason excited opportunity go legacy application that, one, seems like there's confluence event happening. one increasing cost tax supporting managing legacy apps going enough. second, many customer regulated industries, regulator calling -- fact running legacy apps systemic risk, longer kick road. third, also longer kick around, vendor going end-of-life, make decision migrate application modern tech stack. fourth, genai predicated data build competitive advantage, need leverage proprietary data, people want access data able easily. that's another reason want modernize. also people built application retiring longer firm, creates risk companies. given that, customer incredibly interested figuring way easily safely securely migrate -- applications. always could help easily move data map schema relational schema document schema. hardest part essentially rewriting application. advent genai, significantly reduce time. one, use genai analyze existing code. two, use genai reverse engineer test test code does. three, use genai build new code user test ensure new code produce result old code. time effort suddenly cut meaningful way that's suddenly creating lot interest customer saying, goodness. already relational app, moving another relational app feel like modernization. so, advantage moving mongodb give much modern platform, much agile, flexible, performant, scalable platform future needs. that's excited. again, early days. run number pilot gone well. process working customer migration process. take time very, complex applications. actually, one thing also mentioned going -- saying go tertiary tier 2 tier 3 application, saying, hey, want look crown jewel apps painful us.

Welcome to the MongoDB third-quarter fiscal year 2025 conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there'll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your speaker for today, Brian Denyeau. Please go ahead. Brian Raferty Denyeau -- Investor Relations Thank you, Lisa. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today to review MongoDB's third-quarter fiscal 2025 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued after the close of the market today. Joining me the call today are Dev Ittycheria, president and CEO of MongoDB; and Michael Gordon, MongoDB's COO and CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our market and future growth opportunities, our expectations for the macroeconomic environment in fiscal 2025 and the impact of AI, the benefits of our product platform, our competitive landscape, customer behaviors, our financial guidance, and our planned investments in growth opportunities in AI. These statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including the results of operations and financial condition that cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. For a discussion of the material risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please refer to the risks described in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 31st, 2024 that we filed with the SEC on August 30th, 2024. Any forward-looking statements made on this call reflect our views only as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them except as required by law. Additionally, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures on this conference call. Please refer to the tables in our earnings release in the Investor Relations portion of our website for a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dev. Dev? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we had a strong quarter of new business and executed well against our large market opportunity. Let's begin by reviewing our third quarter results before giving you a broader company update. We generated revenue of $529 million, a 22% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew 26% year-over-year, representing 68% of total revenue. We generated non-GAAP operating income of $101 million for a 19% non-GAAP operating margin and we ended the quarter with over 52,600 customers. Overall, we were pleased with our performance in the third quarter. We had a strong new business quarter and we're happy with our new workload acquisition on Atlas. Our non-Atlas business significantly exceeded expectations in part because we benefited from a few large multi-year deals as customers continue to value our run anywhere strategy and want to build a deeper longer-term relationship with MongoDB. Atlas consumption was slightly better than expected in a macro-environment that we would characterize as largely consistent with what we saw in the first half of the year. Michael will cover consumption trends in more detail. Retention rates remained strong in Q3, demonstrating the mission criticality of our platform. On our Q1 earnings call, we shared with you the three major strategic initiatives that we believe will enable us to maximize our long-term opportunity. I want to give you an update on the progress we're making on those initiatives. First, we are increasing our investment in the enterprise channel since we see the strongest returns in this part of the market. Specifically, we're expanding our strategic account program going to next year, as we see more accounts that will benefit from incremental investment. In addition, we're investing time and resources to educate developers in large enterprise accounts and uplevel their MongoDB skills. These organizations have thousands of developers and as we penetrate them more deeply, we encounter developers who have historically only built SQL applications and simply do not know how to use MongoDB to its full potential. In our experience, educating these developers on the benefits of MongoDB drives significant incremental adoption of our platform. To fund these up-market investments, we are reallocating a portion of our mid-market investments. The mid-market remains an attractive opportunity for us, but we believe that prioritizing investment up-market will deliver strong returns in the current environment. We also believe there are additional ways to serve the mid-market more efficiently through our self-serve channel and other scaled technology-enabled sales and customer service motions. Second, we are optimistic about the opportunity to accelerate legacy app modernization using AI and are investing more in this area. As you recall, we ran a few successful pilots earlier this year, demonstrating that AI tooling combined with professional services and our relational migrator product can significantly reduce the time, cost, and risk of migrating legacy applications onto MongoDB. While it's early days, we have observed a more than 50% reduction in the cost to modernize. On the back of these strong early results, additional customer interest is exceeding our expectations. Large enterprises in every industry and geography are experiencing acute pain from their legacy infrastructure and are eager for more agile, performant, and cost-effective solutions. Not only are customers excited to engage with us, they also want to focus on some of the most important applications in their enterprise, further demonstrating the level of interest and size of the long-term opportunity. As relational applications encompass a wide variety of database types, programming languages, versions, and other customer-specific variables, we expect modernization projects to continue to include meaningful service engagements in the short and medium term. Consequently, we're increasing our professional services delivery capabilities, both directly and through partners. In the long run, we expect to automate and simplify large parts of the modernization process. To that end, we are leveraging the learnings from early service engagement to develop new tools to accelerate future modernization efforts. Although it's early days and scaling our legacy app modernization capabilities will take time, we have increased conviction that this motion will significantly add to our growth in the long term. Third, we are investing to capitalize on our inherent technical advantages as a key component of the emerging AI tech stack. As a reminder, MongoDB is uniquely equipped to query rich and complex data structures typical of AI applications. The ability of a database to query rich and complex data structures is crucial because AI applications often rely on highly detailed, interrelated, and nuanced data to make accurate predictions and decisions. For example, a recommendation system doesn't just analyze a single customer's purchase but also considers their browsing history, peer group behavior, and product categories requiring a database that can query and interlink these complex data structures. In addition, MongoDB's architecture unifies source data, metadata, operational data, and vector data in an all-in-one platform, updating the need for multiple database systems and complex back-end architectures. This enables a more compelling developer experience than any other alternative. From what we see in the AI market today, most customers are still in the experimental stage as they work to understand the effectiveness of the underlying tech stack and build early proof-of-concept applications. However, we are seeing an increasing number of AI apps in production. Today, we have thousands of AI apps on our platform. What we don't yet see is many of these apps actually achieving meaningful product market fit and therefore significant traction. In fact, as you take a step back and look at the entire universe of AI apps, a very small percentage of them have achieved the type of scale that we commonly see with enterprise-specific applications. We do have some AI apps that are growing quickly, including one that is already a seven-figure workload that has grown 10 times since the beginning of the year. Similar to prior platform shifts as the usefulness of AI tech improves and becomes more cost-effective, we will see the emergence of many more AI apps that do nail product market fit, but it's difficult to predict when that will happen more broadly. We remain confident that we will capture our fair share of these successful AI applications as we see that our platform is popular with developers building more sophisticated AI use cases. We continue investing in our product capabilities, including enterprise-grade Atlas Vector Search functionality to build on this momentum and even better position MongoDB to capture the AI opportunity. In addition, as previously announced, we are bringing search and vector service to our community and EA offerings, leveraging our run anywhere competitive advantage in the world of AI. Finally, we are expanding our MongoDB AI applications program or MAAP, which helps enterprise customers build and bring AI applications into production by providing them with reference architectures, integrations with leading tech providers, and coordinated services and support. Last week, we announced a new code of partners including McKinsey, Confluent, Capgemini, and Unstructured, as well as the collaboration with Meta to enable developers to build AI-enriched applications on MongoDB using Llama. Next, I'd like to provide you with a brief product update. At our dot local developer conference in London in October, we announced the general availability of MongoDB 8.0, the fastest and most performant version of MongoDB ever. MongoDB 8.0 performs 20% to 60% better against common industry benchmarks compared to our prior version and is built to exceed our customers' most stringent security, resiliency, availability, and performance requirements. To best serve our customers, we regularly review and reprioritize investments in our product portfolio to ensure we're allocating our resources to products with the highest demand from our customers. And to do that, we also deprecate products that are not showing results we desired. Consequently, we made the decision to consolidate our Atlas serverless offerings with our smallest dedicated tiers to create Atlas Flex customers, a new offering with a simpler architecture that provides the elasticity features akin to serverless. We will begin migrating effective customers to the single, simple, entry-level solution in Q4. We also decided to deprecate Atlas DeviceSync and other capabilities not widely adopted in order to focus our engineering resources on the core platform. While these reprioritization decisions are not made lightly, they allow us to deliver the most value to the largest number of customers, reinforcing our commitment to being the best modern database and helping us to grow faster. Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the adoption trends of MongoDB across our customer base. Customers across industries and around the world are running mission-critical projects in MongoDB Atlas, leveraging the full power of our developer data platform, including Financial Times, CarGurus, and Victoria's Secret. As part of the digital transformation journey, global specialty retailer Victoria's Secret & Company migrated its e-commerce platform to MongoDB Atlas. As a fully managed platform, MongoDB Atlas allowed the company to simplify its architecture and improve performance, supporting the retailer to provide a resilient, secure, and fast web and mobile e-commerce experience for their millions of customers around the world. Allianz, Alphamad, Swiss Post, and Paylocity are turning to MongoDB to modernize applications. Paylocity, a leading provider of cloud-based payroll and human capital management software, selected MongoDB to power proprietary application aimed at fostering employee connections and engagement. When traffic increased and the original SQL-based solution was unable to keep up with the required performance metrics, Paylocity migrated to MongoDB Atlas to take advantage of the flexible schema architecture, performance, and scalability. MongoDB costs five times less than the previous SQL database solution and the company's developers can now create an application within minutes, something that used to take weeks. Mature companies and start-ups alike are using MongoDB to help deliver the next wave of AI-powered application to customers, including NerdWallet, Cisco, and Tealbook. Tealbook, a supplier intelligence platform, migrated from Postgres, pgvector, and ElasticSearch to MongoDB to eliminate technical debt and consolidate their tech stack. The company experienced workload isolation and scalability issues in pgvector and were concerned with the search index inconsistencies, which were all resolved with the migration to MongoDB. With Atlas Vector search and dedicated search nodes, Tealbook has realized improved cost-efficiency and increased scalability for the supplier data platform, an application that uses GenAI to collect, verify, and enrich supplier data across various sources. In summary, we had a healthy Q3 with both Atlas and EA exceeding expectations. We saw a strong new business quarter and we remain confident in our ability to become an increasing strategic provider in our large and growing market. Looking forward, we see a great opportunity to grow our adoption in the enterprise through new workloads, modernizing legacy applications, and winning the next generation of AI-powered applications. I would like to finish by providing an update on our senior leadership. First, as we announced early in the press release, after nearly 10 years, Michael Gordon has made the decision to leave MongoDB. Michael has been instrumental in MongoDB's success over the past decade, leading our successful IPO, helping us grow our revenue nearly 50-fold, and scaling -- and successfully scaling our business model to generate meaningful operating leverage. He has been a trusted advisor and business partner to the Board and me over the years and also has become a personal friend. Michael is excited to take a well-deserved break. We have commenced the search for Michael's replacement and will be evaluating both internal and external candidates. One of Michael's proudest compliments -- accomplishments has been building a world-class finance team under his leadership, and I'm confident that we will not miss a beat during this transition. Michael will continue to serve as CFO through January 31st to help us finish the fiscal year and then will transition to an Advisor to the company to ensure a seamless process. If we have not named Michael's successor by fiscal year-end, Serge Tanjga, SVP of Finance, will serve as Interim CFO, beginning on February 1st. Second, we are promoting Cedric Pech, currently our chief revenue officer to the newly created role of president worldwide field operations. In this new position, Cedric will oversee all our field-based customer-facing and go-to-market enablement teams, including professional services. We believe this org structure will best enable us to execute on some of the key strategic initiatives I discussed earlier, in particular, our increased focus on up-market and the app monetization opportunity. I would like to congratulate Cedric on this well-deserved promotion. With that, let me turn the call over to Michael. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Dev, and thanks for the kind words and our incredible partnership over the past decade. The past 10 years have been the most rewarding in my professional career and I'm extremely proud of what we've achieved together and of course, to the whole MongoDB team. With as much success as we had, I still believe that MongoDB is in the early stages of realizing its full potential as it continues to take share in one of the largest markets in software. Now, turning to the results for the quarter. I'll begin with a detailed review of our third-quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025. First, I'll start with our third quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $529.4 million, up 22% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance. Shifting to our product mix, Atlas grew 26% in the quarter compared to the previous year and now represents 68% of total revenue compared to 66% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and 71% last quarter. We recognized Atlas revenue primarily based on customer consumption of our platform and that consumption is closely tied to end user activity of their applications. Let me provide some context on Atlas consumption in the quarter. In Q3, consumption was slightly ahead of our expectations. This year's Q3 seasonal improvement was more muted than in years past as expected. On a year-over-year basis, consumption growth remains below that of prior year period. Turning to non-Atlas revenue. Non-Atlas came in significantly ahead of our expectations. As Dev mentioned, EA new business was strong, and we continue to have success selling incremental workloads into our existing customer base. In addition, our Q3 non-Atlas revenue benefited from a few large multi-year deals. As you know, due to ASC 606, we recognized the entire term license component of a multi-year contract at the start of that contract. Compared to Q3 of last year, the multi-year license component of non-Atlas revenues was over $15 million higher. Turning to customer growth. During the third quarter, we grew our customer base by approximately 1,900 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 52,600, which is up from over 46,400 in the year-ago period. Of our total customer count, over 7,400 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 6,900 in the year-ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven primarily by Atlas, which had over 51,100 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 44,900 in the year-ago period. It is important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers adding their first Atlas workload. Continuing on, in Q3, our net ARR expansion rate was approximately 120%. We ended the quarter with 2,314 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, up from $1,972 in the year-ago period. Moving down the income statement, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the third quarter was $405.7 million, representing a gross margin of 77%, which is flat versus the year-ago period. Our income from operations was $101.5 million or 19% operating margin for the third quarter compared to an 18% operating margin in the year-ago period. The primary reason for more favorable operating income results versus guidance is our revenue outperformance, including the very high margin multi-year license revenue benefit. Net income in the third quarter was $98.1 million or $1.16 per share, based on 84.2 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a net income of $79.1 million or $0.96 per share on 83.7 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding in the year-ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the third quarter with $2.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $37.4 million. After taking into consideration approximately $2.9 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was $34.6 million in the quarter. This compares to free cash flow of $35 million in the year-ago period. In Q3, we did not incur capital expenditures to purchase IPV4 addresses as we previously expected, but we did start making those purchases in November and still expect a total outlay of $20 million to $25 million this fiscal year as we previously communicated. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $515 million to $519 million. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $55 million to $58 million and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.65 based on 84.9 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. For the full-fiscal year 2025, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.973 billion to $1.977 billion, non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $242 million to $245 million, and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $3.01 to $3.03 based on 84 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. Note that the non-GAAP net income per share guidance for the fourth-quarter and full-fiscal year 2025 includes a non-GAAP tax provision of approximately 20%. I'll now provide some more context around our updated guidance. First, in terms of Atlas consumption, we expect to see a typical seasonal slowdown in Q4, driven by underlying application usage moderating during the holiday season. Second, since Atlas consumption remained lower on a year-over-year basis in Q3, we expect to see continued deceleration of Atlas year-over-year growth in Q4. Third, we expect to see a sequential decline in non-Atlas revenue in Q4, which is contrary to our normal pattern. The reason for this is that we experienced a significant additional benefit from multi-year deals in Q3, which we do not expect to recur in Q4. In addition, I want to provide some incremental color on some of our recent product and -- how some of our recent product and go-to-market changes will impact the growth of our reported customer count going forward. First, as Dev explained, we are reallocating a portion of our go-to-market resources from the mid-market to the enterprise channel. As a result, we expect to see significantly fewer mid-market direct sales customer net additions and as a result, slower direct sales customer growth going forward. We believe this reallocation of investment dollars will drive higher revenue growth over time. So, it's a trade-off that makes sense. Second, as we introduce Atlas Flex clusters in Q4 and automatically migrate customers in Q1, we expect to see a one-time negative impact to our customer count since we have approximately 4,000 serverless customers who are very low spending and we do not expect them to transition over to Flex. These customers have a negligible impact on our revenue but will impact our reported customer count. To summarize, we're pleased with our third quarter results and especially our ability to win new business. We have a small share in one of the largest and fastest-growing markets in all of software with a number of secular tailwinds, including AI at our back. We'll continue investing judiciously and focusing on our execution to capture this long-term opportunity. With that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator? Questions & Answers: Operator [Operator instructions] Our first question for the day will be coming from Sanjit Singh of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Thank you for taking the questions and congrats, Michael, on outstanding career. You had an absolutely fantastic run at MongoDB. I'm excited to see what you do next, or excited if you just take a breather. So congrats, Michael. I guess to take the question -- to start off with the questions, when we look at what Atlas has been doing in the past two quarters, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think consumption is coming in at least modestly ahead of your expectations. Relative to what we've seen at the beginning of the year, what sort of -- is it a function of sales execution? Is it a function of the end-user activity sort of improving? What's driving at least the improvement in Atlas consumption in the past two quarters? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So a few different things. So I think if you look at our outlook at the beginning of the year, we had indicated that we thought we would see stable Atlas growth from a consumption standpoint. What we've seen and what we've talked about is -- we've actually seen lower year-over-year growth based on the underlying consumption. And so -- and that's incorporated into our Q4 guide. We have seen the Q3 and Q4 be -- sorry, Q2 and Q3, excuse me, be better than our expectations, but it's still down on a year-over-year basis. And so I want to make sure that we're not sort of confusing the comparative set of year-over-year versus relative to our expectations. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Understood. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer And the core of it, Sanjit, to your question is really the underlying usage of the applications. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Yeah, that makes total sense. And then, Dev, I have to ask you the AI agent question. In terms of an AI agent needing more context, it has going to have a set of tools to take its actions. What does it mean for MongoDB as an operational data store as customers start to roll out more agentic applications? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, just to talk about agents, I think when you think about agents, there's jobs, there's -- sorry, there's a job, there's projects and then there's task. Right now, the agents that are being rolled out are really focused on task like say something from Sierra or some other companies are rolling out agents. But you're right, what they deemed to do is to deal with being able to create a rich and complex data structures. Now why is this important for AI is that AI models don't just look at isolated data points, but they need to understand relationships, hierarchies, and patterns within the data. They need to be able to essentially get real-time insights. For example, if you have a chatbot where someone is querying, a customer is kind of trying to get some update on the order they placed five minutes ago because they may have not gotten any confirmation, your chatbot needs to be able to deal with real-time information. You need to be able to deal with basically handling very advanced use cases, understanding like, to do things like fraud detection to understand behaviors of supply chains, you need to understand intricate data relationships. All these things are consistent with MongoDB offers. And so we believe that at the end of the day, we are well-positioned to handle this. And the other thing that I would say is that we've embedded in a very natural way of search and vector search. So we're just not an OLTP database, we do tech search and vector search. That's all one experience and no other platform offers that, and we think we have a real advantage. And so we're integrated with the leading AI frameworks and platforms. We have enterprise-grade security and compliance, and customers can run us anywhere, either on 118 cloud regions or on-prem, and that again is a huge differentiator for us. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Awesome. Appreciate the thoughts, Dev. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Sanjit. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Taylor -- Tyler Radke of Citi. Your line is open. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Hi, thank you very much for taking the question. And, Michael, all the best, and congratulations on 10 years. Going back to the sales execution, I mean, one of the things that you talked about earlier this year was some challenges just in terms of the recently acquired workloads ramping. And I think a lot of those were from the past fiscal year. So curious how the quality of workload acquisition has trended this year. And as you think about the ramp in consumption potential into next year, how does that sort of look versus this time a year ago? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Maybe I'll just talk about what we're doing and the changes we made and then Michael can talk a little bit about the consumption trends. So, we did make some changes at the beginning of the year, and we really wanted to focus on both the volume and the quality of the workloads and there were some slight adjustments that we made. We think those changes are having a reasonable positive impact. Again, it's too early to declare victory because these workloads usually start small and grow over time, but we're really pleased with the results we're seeing so far. And -- but again, it's early days. And obviously, we'll know about the fiscal '25 workloads as we go into fiscal '26. But so far, so good. Michael, on consumption? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, just a couple of things, and thanks, Tyler. The fiscal '24 cohorts that we called out earlier, that slower growth does continue. They've been in line with our revised expectations. We made some changes that we talked about at the -- earlier in the year that should affect the fiscal '25 cohorts, but it's just too early to tell. On those, we need a few more quarters of data before you can really see if we're -- how we're seeing those behave differently. I will say we've talked about the new business environment and our success in new business. We have been pleased with that, but that just shows kind of the initial piece, and we need to see how they grow and how those cohorts evolve. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Great. Thanks. And follow-up on the EA side, you talked about the outsized strength in non-Atlas business this quarter. Maybe if you could unpack like the relative upside that was driven by simply duration versus new business. I know you called out the duration impact year-over-year, but are -- do you feel like this was sort of a one-off or do you feel like maybe some of your bigger customers are indexing more toward EA and how does that impact the way you think about the product and introducing things like vector search and stream processing onto the on-prem product? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, thank you. So overall, we continue to find the EA product resonate with customers. It's an important part of the run anywhere strategy and we've continued to see success with that and people wanting to increase their investment in MongoDB. There's always been a multiyear component and we continue to see that. We talked about that at the beginning of the year as to how fiscal '24 had an abnormally high amount of multi-year benefit and therefore, we were anticipating that being a headwind and we quantified that in roughly the $40 million range. What we talked about on this call earlier is we saw from a few large accounts, a surprising amount of multiyear that positively benefited Q3 at a little more than $15 million in revenue compared to what we saw Q3 a year ago. So, not as much of a headwind as we had been expecting. Obviously, with the 606 dynamics, some of these things, especially for a large deal can be kind of meaty and chunky and lumpy, which is why we try and call it out and sort of help people understand, but there's a pretty healthy kind of baseline flow, not just of EA, but also of multiyear. And when we see spikes, we just try and call it out for you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I just want to add, Tyler, that we are investing in our what we call our EA business. First, we're starting by investing with search and vector search and a community product. That does a couple of things for us. One, whenever anyone starts with MongoDB with the open-source product, they immediately get all the benefits of that complete highly integrated platform. Two, those capabilities will then migrate to EA. So, EA for us is an investment strategy. We definitely see lots of large customers who are very, very committed to running workloads on-prem. We even see some customers want to run to run AI workloads on-prem. So, the optionality they get by using MongoDB to not just be on-prem and the cloud, but also cross-cloud is a very compelling one. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Brad Reback of Stifel. Your line is open. Brad Reback -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. And, Michael, best of luck. It's been a great run. Dev, you started the call talking about a bunch of investments, which are great given the growth of the business. And obviously, you talked about reallocating some expenses. But net-net, should we think about this incremental investment phase next year as gating margin upside? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think that's something that we obviously are not ready to talk about next year just now, but I would say that we -- the reason we're looking to invest and just to summarize again, going up-market on legacy app modernization where we see very large workloads potentially at play and being the ideal database for GenAI apps, which is the future as important investments to drive long-term growth. And we're quite energized by those investments and that's something that we have high conviction on. Brad Reback -- Analyst That's great. And then on the MAAP program, are most of those workloads going to wind up in Atlas or will that be a healthy combination of EA and Atlas? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think it's again early days. I would say -- I would probably say more on the side of Atlas and EA in the early days. I think once we introduce a search and vector search into the EA product, you'll see more of that on-prem. Obviously, people can use MongoDB for AI workloads using other technologies as well in conjunction with MongoDB for on-prem AI use cases. But I would say you're probably going to see that happen first in Atlas. Brad Reback -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Jason Ader of William Blair. Your line is open. Jason Ader -- Analyst Yeah, thank you. I'm not going to belabor congratulating Michael, but it has been it has been fun working with you and best of luck. The question I had is on the strength in EA. Do you think, Dev, it represents a comment on how enterprises might be rethinking or reassessing the kind of on-prem versus cloud workload placement decision? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Well, when I think about large enterprises, I think large enterprises have meaningful workloads that are still running on-prem. I think the belief that everything would go to the cloud was probably something that was really popular in the good old days of Zurp. But I think now as customers assess their investments that they already have in place, they're being much more judicious about where they run those workloads and if they think they can leverage their existing investments in their own infrastructure, then they're going to do so. Also for a bunch of other reasons like regulatory reasons, some customers are quite not moving as aggressively to the cloud. We see that in particularly in Europe, where we see a lot of the European banks still running majority of the workloads on-prem. So it also varies by region where conversely in Asia, we're seeing people much move much more aggressively to the cloud. So I think it really depends on industry, on geography, and on the personal dynamics of what's happening in that particular account. I mean, we see some large US banks are also very committed to running things on-prem. So it really varies. And that's why we feel really good about our run anywhere strategy because it gives customer optionality. They can build something and run on-prem. And if and when they choose to move to the cloud, it's very easy to do so with MongoDB. Jason Ader -- Analyst All right. And then just as a follow-up also on the investments you're making in strategic sales and enterprise. Could you just get a little more specific on what those investments might be? Is it hiring a lot of new salespeople? Is it working more with SIs, investing more in SIs? Any additional detail would be helpful. Thanks. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So just for everyone's benefit, we've identified a number of accounts, which we call strategic accounts, which we think that have high upside for us. We've seen a number of accounts that grow very quickly when we deploy the right mix of resources. Now they're all not necessarily quota-carrying resources. They could be additional technical sales resources, additional PS resources, additional customer service resources to better service and support those accounts. We even do things like run education sessions for developers of the accounts, they're called either hackathons or like what we call developer days or even design reviews where we'll meet with our development teams who are looking to build an application, help them think about how they would potentially use MongoDB to build that particular app. And what we find is that because many of these developers, the experience with MongoDB is quite limited, the more we can engage with them, the more we can educate them and the more we can show them how simple and easy it is. Like for example, most customers today think like they have to use an OLTP database, then a search database, maybe a vector database, and then like a caching database. And all that is integrated in MongoDB. So all of a sudden, customers can say, wow, I can simplify my life, simplify my back-end infrastructure, build this app far more quickly and it will be much more easier to manage long-term if I do everything on MongoDB. And it's really a function of just educating them on the power of MongoDB that really opens up a lot of opportunities for us. So that's why we're doubling down, and the mix of resources is really predicated on the accounts, but it's not just quota counting resources, it's the whole suite of resources that we're bringing to the table. Jason Ader -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Andrew Nowinski of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Okay. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking the question and congrats on a nice quarter. You gave an example of a customer that migrated off Postgres and I think you said they had issues with their PG vector function. I was wondering how long was that customer using Postgres before they decided to make a change to Mongo, meaning was this some sort of like a rebound type customer where they chose PG -- or excuse me, Postgres and it didn't work? And then how frequently are you seeing this type of transition? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So I can't give you the specifics on how long they were using Postgres, but this is not -- this is a trend that we're seeing in our business. You have to remember Postgres is a 40-year-old technology. It's -- and they have been the beneficiary of people lifting and shifting from other types of relational databases, Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, et cetera. And they're an open-source database. And but as part -- because they're an open-source and relational database, they have the same inherent challenges all relational databases do. They're quite inflexible. So once you build a schema, it's very hard to change the schema. It's hard to scale and hard to distribute data. And if you have large data volumes, you have to do weird things like, for example, resort to off-road storage for large data objects, which creates performance bottlenecks. And so again, people default to Postgres if they don't know anything better because all they know is relational and everyone is kind of moving off those other relational platforms. And that's the whole point I was saying earlier. Once we educate developers on the flexibility of schema, how easily or horizontally scale the rich query language where you can do aggregations and do sophisticated geospatial indexes, the productivity gains by using the document model and how easy is to organize data, it's -- people are just like, wow, life is so much easier. Now I want to be clear, this is not a zero-sum game. Postgres does not have to fail for us to be successful. It's a big market and we're quite excited about the opportunity, but we do see customers moving off Postgres and coming to MongoDB. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Thank you. That was very helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up. If we normalize the $15 million multiyear deal impact you had in Q3, would EA still be down sequentially in Q4? Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer We haven't given that level of guidance, but just trying to help you understand in the context of the full-year numbers and the headwind that we talked about at the beginning of the year, just given the strength that we saw in Q3. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Got it. Thanks. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. The next question will be coming from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst Hey, thank you. And if you think about the EA strength this quarter, Michael, you'd kind of give us a little bit there. Like how should we think about renewal -- the renewal situation renewal pool coming up like or that you had in Q3, coming up in Q4, et cetera, as well and then like what does it mean in terms of upsell, cross-sell opportunity as people think about starting AI projects by self-serve, as you kind of mentioned earlier on the call? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So I think about -- if you think about EA for Q4, it tends to be a large renewal quarter, but what we're talking about in terms of the guide is because we had such strength in multiyear, that's where we would expect to see our EA down sequentially, which is not typically our pattern, which is why we called it out. In terms of AI workloads and some of those other things, I think it's early to tell and obviously, we'll continue to evolve and assess our view when we get to the full-year guide in March. And then we'll also have an updated view on how the cohorts are behaving and sort of how multiyear played out. But I think in terms of Q4, the comments that I made earlier hopefully will help. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst Yeah. Okay, perfect. And then the -- and can you talk a little bit about like obviously, there's a debate of like which database will be the persistent layer if you do AI projects, et cetera. What do you see from the big hyperscalers in terms of working with you guys and partnerships? We obviously just have AWS kind of summit, et-cetera. Can you speak a little bit like how your relationship with those big guys is evolving around this? And Michael, All the best in case I don't talk to you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, I'll start with the partnerships first, like our -- with AWS, as you said, they just had their re:Invent show last week. Our -- it remains very, very strong. We've closed a ton of deals this past quarter. Some of them very, very large deals. We're doing integrations to some of the new products like Q and Bedrock and the engagement in the field has been really strong. On Azure, I think we -- as I've shared in the past, we start-off with a little bit of a slow start, but in the words of the person who runs their partner leadership, the Azure MongoDB relationship has never been stronger. We've closed a large number of deals. We're part of what's called the Azure native IC service program and have a bunch of deep integrations with Azure, including Fabric, Power BI, Visual Studio, Semantic Kernel, and Azure OpenAI Studio. And we're also one of Azure's largest marketplace partners. And GCP does -- we have actually seen some uptick in terms of co-sales that we've done this past quarter and GCP made some comp changes where they -- that were favorable to working with MongoDB that we saw some results in the field, and we're focused on closing on -- closing a handful of large deals with GCP in Q4. So in general, I would say, things are going quite well. And then in terms of, I guess, implying your question was like the hyperscalers and are they potentially bundling things along with their AI offerings? I mean, candidly, since day one, the hyperscalers have been bundling their database offerings with every offering that they have and that's been their predominant strategy. And we've -- I think we've executed well against strategy because databases are not like a by-the-way decision. It's an important decision. And I think the hyperscalers are seeing our performance and realize it's better to partner with us. And as I said, customers understand the importance of the data layer, especially for AI applications. And so the partnership across all three hyperscalers is strong. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst OK, perfect. Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Raimo. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. The next question will be coming from the line of Brad Sills of Bank of America. Your line is open. Brad Sills -- Analyst Great. Thank you so much, and congratulations, Michael, on your next move. I wanted to ask about new workloads here on vector search, stream processing, relational migrator. Is there any one of those three that's ramping faster than maybe you expected? Just a little bit of color on how those new workload types are ramping. Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I'll kind of give you just a rundown of some of the -- I mean, essentially you're asking about the new products, like our -- on search, we introduced a new capability called Atlas search nodes, which where you can asymmetrically scale your search nodes because if you have a search-intensive use case, you don't have to scale all your nodes because they have become quite expensive. And we've seen that this kind of groundbreaking capability really well received. The demand is quite high and because customers like they can tune the configuration to the unique needs of their search requirements. One of the world's largest banks is using Atlas Search to provide like a Google-like search experience on payments data for massive corporate customers. So this is a customer-facing application and so performance, and scalability are critical. A leading provider of AI-powered accounting software uses Atlas Search to power its invoice analytics future, which allows end users and finance teams to perform ad-hoc analysis and easily find past-due invoices and voices that contain errors. So that search -- on vector search, it -- again, and it's been our kind of our first full-year since going generally available. And the product uptake has been actually very, very high. In Q3, we released quantization for Atlas Vector Search, which reduces the memory requirements by up to 96%, allowing us to support larger vector workloads with vastly improved price performance. For example, a multinational news organization created a GenAI powered tool designed to help producers and journalists efficiently search, summarize, and verify information from vast and varied data sources. A leading security firm is using Atlas Vector Search to fight AI fraud and a leading global media company replaced elastic search with hybrid search and vector search use case for a user recommendation engine that's built to suggest -- that's built in to suggest articles to end users. And so that's super exciting to see as well. We're also seeing a lot of interest in our streaming product, demand is very high. We just rolled it out to another hyperscaler, and customers are commenting on that the use cases of being able to embed stream processing with MongoDB makes our life so much easier. So overall, we're quite pleased with the progress we're making on the new products. And as I said before, natively bundling all these capabilities really reduces or eliminates the need for customers to have to bolt on a bunch of different technologies to solve the same problem, saving them a lot of time, money, cost, and risk. Brad Sills -- Analyst That's really exciting. Thanks, Dev. And then I wanted to ask a question around Cedric's appointment. Any focus that may be different here under his leadership that we should be thinking about going forward? Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer No, Cedric has been our CRO for, gosh, now like I think like five, six years, and he -- I was the Interim CRO for about three quarters until he took over when we last made a change and this is really an expansion of his responsibilities. I've known Cedric for a long time. He and I have worked with at multiple different companies. I think I have a good barometer for understanding sales leadership. There's a number of sales leaders who worked at other top-tier software companies who used to work for me or with me. And so I'm super-excited by the role Cedric is going to take and then we're also making some changes under Cedric to better align the different organizations so that we can more tightly work together on going up-market, on app monetization and positioning ourselves well to be the ideal database for GenAI apps. Brad Sills -- Analyst Super exciting. Thanks, Dev. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Brad. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question, please. Our next question will be coming from the line of Mike Cikos of Needham and Company. Your line is open. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Hey guys, thanks for taking the question here. I just wanted to come back to the consumption growth being slightly better than expectations again for the second quarter in a row now. And apologies if I missed it, but this improvement that we're seeing, is this across all vintages and geographies or is it potentially more concentrated in scope? Just trying to get a better understanding of what's seeking place out there and what's embedded in the guide. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. No, I would describe it as broad-based, Mike. And obviously, we're pleased to see it and we're continuing monitoring and slicing and dicing it in different ways. And as we have information or insights to you, we'll share it. And without trying to throw a whole bunch of cold water on our mind, it was slightly better, or a step-function changed better, but good to see. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Terrific. And maybe for a quick follow-up for Dev. I think it builds off maybe Tyler's question at the top of the Q&A, but you had cited that some customers are thinking about their workloads more holistically and even looking to run AI workloads on-prem. How much of that do you think is just a function of customers are still trying to figure out how to optimize for latency and cost or is this more a demonstration of we really are in the early phases of the exploratory phase versus going into production? Is there any way to coarse that out or is the two not necessarily connected? Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer No, I think it's kind of a little bit of both. I think you have some customers who are very committed to running a big part of the estate on-prem. So by definition, then if they're going to build an AI workload, it has to be run on-prem, which means that they also need access to GPUs and they're doing that. And then other customers are leveraging basically renting GPUs from the cloud providers and building their own AI workloads. I do think we're in the very, very early days. They're still learning, experimenting. More-and-more apps are entering production. And as I said on the prepared remarks, we have thousands of workload -- AI workloads running on MongoDB, but a very small percentage of them have demonstrated meaningful product market fit. And so the initial traction is kind of still small. But I think as people get more sophisticated with AI, as the AI technology matures and becomes more and more useful, I think applications will -- you'll start seeing these applications take-off. I kind of chuckled that today I see more senior leaders bragging about the chips they're using versus the apps they're building. So it just tells you that we're still in the very, very early days of this big platform shift. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Great point. Thank you again, guys. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Mike. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Eric Heath of KeyBanc. Your line is open. Eric Heath -- Analyst Hi, thanks for taking the question. Dev, Michael, it sounds like the takeaway from the call is a greater focus on EA and on enterprise. So should we structurally rethink the EA business differently and think of this more as a healthy double-digit growth business going forward for the foreseeable future? And then if I could just ask a follow-up question separate to that. But Michael, I understand that it's still early to identify the fiscal '25 cohort of workloads, but just curious at a high-level if they look and feel like of higher quality than the fiscal '24 cohort of workflow. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Do you want to take on the first one in terms of EA... Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, I mean, I would say, I mean, we are very committed to our run anywhere strategy. And as I said, we are first investing in community where for many customers is the first way they experience MongoDB. And we want them to have the full experience of integrating search and Vector search into our core product. And so they can out of the gate really start building applications. That will then transition to building those capabilities into EA. So, we are clearly investing in the EA product. But Atlas is still a big, big part of our business and a big, big part of our growth engine and we typically launch new features on Atlas and because of the capabilities we already have, the fact it's multi-cloud makes it a very, very compelling offering for many customers. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. And I think in terms of the workloads, I do think it's early. Just as a reminder for folks, they tend to start small, although grow quickly. I think the only other thing that I can add is, we've been pretty consistent and that we've been pleased with the new business that we've done. But we need some time to let the cohorts play out as we track them. But I think like I said, we've been happy with the new business that we were winning. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of William Power of Baird. Your line is open. Brian Raferty Denyeau -- Investor Relations You there, William? William Power -- Analyst Sorry, yeah. Thank you. Dev, you had some encouraging comments on relational migrator. I wonder if you could just touch on what you think is driving the higher interest here. I mean, it sounds like AI is contributing and helping, but it'd be great to get some more color there because that still feels like obviously a meaningful long-term opportunity. And then maybe the second part of the question for Dev or Michael, just be great to get any other framework around the professional services investments. Any way to kind of think about quantification and timing of that? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So the reason we're so excited about the opportunity to go after legacy applications is that, one, it seems like there's a confluence of events happening. One is that the increasing cost and tax of supporting and managing these legacy apps are just going up enough. Second, for many customers who are in regulated industries, the regulators are calling their -- the fact that they're running on these legacy apps with systemic risk, so they can no longer kick the can down the road. Third, also because they no longer can kick the can around, some vendors are going end-of-life, so they have to make a decision to migrate those applications to a more modern tech stack. Fourth, because GenAI is so predicated on data and to build a competitive advantage, you need to leverage your proprietary data, people want to access that data and be able to do so easily. And so that's another reason for them to want to modernize. And then you also have people who built those applications who are retiring or just no longer in the firm, so it just creates more and more risk for the companies. Given all that, customers are incredibly interested in figuring out a way to easily and safely and securely migrate those -- off those applications. And we always could help them very easily move the data and map the schema from a relational schema to a document schema. The hardest part was essentially rewriting the application. Now with the advent of GenAI, you can now significantly reduce the time. One, you can use GenAI to analyze existing code. Two, you can use GenAI to reverse engineer tests to test what the code does. And then three, you can use GenAI to build new code and then users test it to ensure that the new code produces the same results as the old code. And so all that time and effort is suddenly cut in a meaningful way and that's suddenly creating a lot of interest from customers saying, my goodness. And if you're already on a relational app, moving to another relational app doesn't feel like modernization. So, the other advantage is that moving to MongoDB gives them a much more modern platform, a much more agile, flexible, performant, and scalable platform for their future needs. And that's why we're so excited. Again, it's early days. We've run a number of pilots that have gone well. We're in the process of working with some customers now in the migration process. This will take time because these are very, very complex applications. And actually, one thing I also mentioned was that they're not just going after -- saying go after some tertiary Tier 2 or Tier 3 application, they're saying, hey, we want you to look at some of our crown jewels because these are the apps that are most painful for us. So that's also very exciting. But again, this will take time, but we're very committed to this, and we think this is going to drive -- help us drive long-term -- meaningful long-term growth. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, Will. And to the last part of your question on the professional services investment, we're really building out that capacity in order to meet the demand that we're seeing relative to the opportunity. We're calling it in particular because it has a gross margin impact because that's where that will typically show up. And then maybe the last thing and it's probably obvious, but just to sort of underscore it is the reason we're doing this though is for the ARR, right, to drive the new workloads, the additional workloads over to MongoDB as part of that migration. And over time, as we've talked about before, we hope and expect to be able to leverage technology more and more, but at least initially and into the medium-term, there's going to be a healthy human/services component to that. Just wanted to sort of effectively telegraph that out to folks. William Power -- Analyst That's helpful. Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Will. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Rudy Kessinger of DA Davidson. Please go ahead. Rudy Kessinger -- Analyst Hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in here. I believe last quarter you said consumption growth slightly ahead of expectations. And while down slower year-over-year growth versus Q2 last year, the year-over-year growth did improve from Q1. And so, I guess I'm curious for Q3, could you make a comment in that same regard? Obviously, slower on a year-over-year basis than Q3 last year, but was it stable with year-over-year consumption growth in Q2 or better or worse? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Rudy, thanks for the question. We haven't specifically called that out relative to Q2. We did see a lower year-over-year growth as we called out. We did see a seasonal rebound. Usually Q3 is stronger than Q2 and we talked about how that was smaller than in the prior year. So hopefully, that will help you all triangulate. Rudy Kessinger -- Analyst Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. I believe it was on your Q4 call back in March. At that point, Dev, you said it would be at least another year until AI applications are being deployed at scale. It sounds like the commentary that some early large workloads, but out of the thousands, just not many that are at large scale. I guess, is your expectation now that maybe it's still at least another year until we're seeing broad AI application rollouts at scale? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I think a lot of it's a function of the what's happening in the R&D side of AI, right? So for example, today, we don't have a very compelling model designed for our phones, right, because today the phones don't have the computing horsepower to run complex models. So, you don't see a ton of very, very successful consumer apps besides, say, ChatGPT or Claude. So we don't -- we also don't see like hundreds of apps taking off like you saw kind of the first generation of like the Internet or the cloud era, right, or the mobile era. So like I think we're still in the early days of AI. And so while we see a lot of people building AI apps, a lot of them have kind of fairly rudimentary functionality. But I think that over time that's going to change. In fact, I know it will change. I just can't predict when that will happen. But where we do see apps having production, we are having traction, we're seeing them grow very, very quickly and we have a lot of them on our platform. It's just very few of them are really have meaningful. Operator Thank you. And that concludes today's Q&A session. I would like to go ahead and turn the call back over to Dev for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, everyone. I just wanted to say we're really pleased with our Q3 results with strong new business performance and revenue exceeding expectations both -- across both Atlas and EA. We're making the necessary investments to expand our enterprise channel where we see the largest opportunity to establish MongoDB as a standard and the strongest returns on our go-to-market investments. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the progress we're making on both accelerating legacy app modernization with AI as well as establishing ourselves as a standard of the emerging AI tech stack for greenfield AI applications. And last but not least, I would like to thank Michael again for his contributions over the past 10 years and wish him well. Thank you, everyone, and we'll talk to you soon.

investments, reallocating portion mid-market investments. mid-market remains attractive opportunity us, believe prioritizing investment up-market deliver strong return current environment. also believe additional way serve mid-market efficiently self-serve channel scaled technology-enabled sale customer service motions. second, optimistic opportunity accelerate legacy app modernization using ai investing area. recall, ran successful pilot earlier year, demonstrating ai tooling combined professional service relational migrator product significantly reduce time, cost, risk migrating legacy application onto mongodb. early days, observed 50% reduction cost modernize. back strong early results, additional customer interest exceeding expectations. large enterprise every industry geography experiencing acute pain legacy infrastructure eager agile, performant, cost-effective solutions. customer excited engage us, also want focus important application enterprise, demonstrating level interest size long-term opportunity. relational application encompass wide variety database types, programming languages, versions, customer-specific variables, expect modernization project continue include meaningful service engagement short medium term. consequently, increasing professional service delivery capabilities, directly partners. long run, expect automate simplify large part modernization process. end, leveraging learning early service engagement develop new tool accelerate future modernization efforts. although early day scaling legacy app modernization capability take time, increased conviction motion significantly add growth long term. third, investing capitalize inherent technical advantage key component emerging ai tech stack. reminder, mongodb uniquely equipped query rich complex data structure typical ai applications. ability database query rich complex data structure crucial ai application often rely highly detailed, interrelated, nuanced data make accurate prediction decisions. example, recommendation system analyze single customer's purchase also considers browsing history, peer group behavior, product category requiring database query interlink complex data structures. addition, mongodb's architecture unifies source data, metadata, operational data, vector data all-in-one platform, updating need multiple database system complex back-end architectures. enables compelling developer experience alternative. see ai market today, customer still experimental stage work understand effectiveness underlying tech stack build early proof-of-concept applications. however, seeing increasing number ai apps production. today, thousand ai apps platform. yet see many apps actually achieving meaningful product market fit therefore significant traction. fact, take step back look entire universe ai apps, small percentage achieved type scale commonly see enterprise-specific applications. ai apps growing quickly, including one already seven-figure workload grown 10 time since beginning year. similar prior platform shift usefulness ai tech improves becomes cost-effective, see emergence many ai apps nail product market fit, difficult predict happen broadly. remain confident capture fair share successful ai application see platform popular developer building sophisticated ai use cases. continue investing product capabilities, including enterprise-grade atlas vector search functionality build momentum even better position mongodb capture ai opportunity. addition, previously announced, bringing search vector service community ea offerings, leveraging run anywhere competitive advantage world ai. finally, expanding mongodb ai application program maap, help enterprise customer build bring ai application production providing reference architectures, integration leading tech providers, coordinated service support. last week, announced new code partner including mckinsey, confluent, capgemini, unstructured, well collaboration meta enable developer build ai-enriched application mongodb using llama. next, like provide brief product update. dot local developer conference london october, announced general availability mongodb 8.0, fastest performant version mongodb ever. mongodb 8.0 performs 20% 60% better common industry benchmark compared prior version built exceed customers' stringent security, resiliency, availability, performance requirements. best serve customers, regularly review reprioritize investment product portfolio ensure allocating resource product highest demand customers. that, also deprecate product showing result desired. consequently, made decision consolidate atlas serverless offering smallest dedicated tier create atlas flex customers, new offering simpler architecture provides elasticity feature akin serverless. begin migrating effective customer single, simple, entry-level solution q4. also decided deprecate atlas devicesync capability widely adopted order focus engineering resource core platform. reprioritization decision made lightly, allow u deliver value largest number customers, reinforcing commitment best modern database helping u grow faster. now, like spend minute reviewing adoption trend mongodb across customer base. customer across industry around world running mission-critical project mongodb atlas, leveraging full power developer data platform, including financial times, cargurus, victoria's secret. part digital transformation journey, global specialty retailer victoria's secret & company migrated e-commerce platform mongodb atlas. fully managed platform, mongodb atlas allowed company simplify architecture improve performance, supporting retailer provide resilient, secure, fast web mobile e-commerce experience million customer around world. allianz, alphamad, swiss post, paylocity turning mongodb modernize applications. paylocity, leading provider cloud-based payroll human capital management software, selected mongodb power proprietary application aimed fostering employee connection engagement. traffic increased original sql-based solution unable keep required performance metrics, paylocity migrated mongodb atlas take advantage flexible schema architecture, performance, scalability. mongodb cost five time less previous sql database solution company's developer create application within minutes, something used take weeks. mature company start-ups alike using mongodb help deliver next wave ai-powered application customers, including nerdwallet, cisco, tealbook. tealbook, supplier intelligence platform, migrated postgres, pgvector, elasticsearch mongodb eliminate technical debt consolidate tech stack. company experienced workload isolation scalability issue pgvector concerned search index inconsistencies, resolved migration mongodb. atlas vector search dedicated search nodes, tealbook realized improved cost-efficiency increased scalability supplier data platform, application us genai collect, verify, enrich supplier data across various sources. summary, healthy q3 atlas ea exceeding expectations. saw strong new business quarter remain confident ability become increasing strategic provider large growing market. looking forward, see great opportunity grow adoption enterprise new workloads, modernizing legacy applications, winning next generation ai-powered applications. would like finish providing update senior leadership. first, announced early press release, nearly 10 years, michael gordon made decision leave mongodb. michael instrumental mongodb's success past decade, leading successful ipo, helping u grow revenue nearly 50-fold, scaling -- successfully scaling business model generate meaningful operating leverage. trusted advisor business partner board year also become personal friend. michael excited take well-deserved break. commenced search michael's replacement evaluating internal external candidates. one michael's proudest compliment -- accomplishment building world-class finance team leadership, confident miss beat transition. michael continue serve cfo january 31st help u finish fiscal year transition advisor company ensure seamless process. named michael's successor fiscal year-end, serge tanjga, svp finance, serve interim cfo, beginning february 1st. second, promoting cedric pech, currently chief revenue officer newly created role president worldwide field operations. new position, cedric oversee field-based customer-facing go-to-market enablement teams, including professional services. believe org structure best enable u execute key strategic initiative discussed earlier, particular, increased focus up-market app monetization opportunity. would like congratulate cedric well-deserved promotion. that, let turn call michael. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer thanks, dev, thanks kind word incredible partnership past decade. past 10 year rewarding professional career extremely proud achieved together course, whole mongodb team. much success had, still believe mongodb early stage realizing full potential continues take share one largest market software. now, turning result quarter. begin detailed review third-quarter result finish outlook fourth quarter full fiscal year 2025. first, start third quarter results. total revenue quarter $529.4 million, 22% year-over-year high end guidance. shifting product mix, atlas grew 26% quarter compared previous year represents 68% total revenue compared 66% third quarter fiscal 2024 71% last quarter. recognized atlas revenue primarily based customer consumption platform consumption closely tied end user activity applications. let provide context atlas consumption quarter. q3, consumption slightly ahead expectations. year's q3 seasonal improvement muted year past expected. year-over-year basis, consumption growth remains prior year period. turning non-atlas revenue. non-atlas came significantly ahead expectations. dev mentioned, ea new business strong, continue success selling incremental workload existing customer base. addition, q3 non-atlas revenue benefited large multi-year deals. know, due asc 606, recognized entire term license component multi-year contract start contract. compared q3 last year, multi-year license component non-atlas revenue $15 million higher. turning customer growth. third quarter, grew customer base approximately 1,900 customer sequentially, bringing total customer count 52,600, 46,400 year-ago period. total customer count, 7,400 direct sale customers, compare 6,900 year-ago period. growth total customer count driven primarily atlas, 51,100 customer end quarter compared 44,900 year-ago period. important keep mind growth atlas customer count reflects new customer mongodb addition existing ea customer adding first atlas workload. continuing on, q3, net arr expansion rate approximately 120%. ended quarter 2,314 customer least $100,000 arr annualized mrr, $1,972 year-ago period. moving income statement, discussing result non-gaap basis unless otherwise noted. gross profit third quarter $405.7 million, representing gross margin 77%, flat versus year-ago period. income operation $101.5 million 19% operating margin third quarter compared 18% operating margin year-ago period. primary reason favorable operating income result versus guidance revenue outperformance, including high margin multi-year license revenue benefit. net income third quarter $98.1 million $1.16 per share, based 84.2 million diluted weighted average share outstanding. compare net income $79.1 million $0.96 per share 83.7 million diluted weighted-average share outstanding year-ago period. turning balance sheet cash flow, ended third quarter $2.3 billion cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash. operating cash flow third quarter $37.4 million. taking consideration approximately $2.9 million capital expenditure principal repayment finance lease liabilities, free cash flow $34.6 million quarter. compare free cash flow $35 million year-ago period. q3, incur capital expenditure purchase ipv4 address previously expected, start making purchase november still expect total outlay $20 million $25 million fiscal year previously communicated. like turn outlook fourth quarter full fiscal year 2025. fourth quarter, expect revenue range $515 million $519 million. expect non-gaap income operation range $55 million $58 million non-gaap net income per share range $0.62 $0.65 based 84.9 million estimated diluted weighted-average share outstanding. full-fiscal year 2025, expect revenue range $1.973 billion $1.977 billion, non-gaap income operation range $242 million $245 million, non-gaap net income per share range $3.01 $3.03 based 84 million estimated diluted weighted-average share outstanding. note non-gaap net income per share guidance fourth-quarter full-fiscal year 2025 includes non-gaap tax provision approximately 20%. provide context around updated guidance. first, term atlas consumption, expect see typical seasonal slowdown q4, driven underlying application usage moderating holiday season. second, since atlas consumption remained lower year-over-year basis q3, expect see continued deceleration atlas year-over-year growth q4. third, expect see sequential decline non-atlas revenue q4, contrary normal pattern. reason experienced significant additional benefit multi-year deal q3, expect recur q4. addition, want provide incremental color recent product -- recent product go-to-market change impact growth reported customer count going forward. first, dev explained, reallocating portion go-to-market resource mid-market enterprise channel. result, expect see significantly fewer mid-market direct sale customer net addition result, slower direct sale customer growth going forward. believe reallocation investment dollar drive higher revenue growth time. so, trade-off make sense. second, introduce atlas flex cluster q4 automatically migrate customer q1, expect see one-time negative impact customer count since approximately 4,000 serverless customer low spending expect transition flex. customer negligible impact revenue impact reported customer count. summarize, pleased third quarter result especially ability win new business. small share one largest fastest-growing market software number secular tailwinds, including ai back. continue investing judiciously focusing execution capture long-term opportunity. that, like open questions. operator? question & answers: operator [operator instructions] first question day coming sanjit singh morgan stanley. line open. sanjit singh -- analyst thank taking question congrats, michael, outstanding career. absolutely fantastic run mongodb. excited see next, excited take breather. congrats, michael. guess take question -- start questions, look atlas past two quarters, correct wrong, think consumption coming least modestly ahead expectations. relative seen beginning year, sort -- function sale execution? function end-user activity sort improving? what's driving least improvement atlas consumption past two quarters? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. different things. think look outlook beginning year, indicated thought would see stable atlas growth consumption standpoint. seen talked -- actually seen lower year-over-year growth based underlying consumption. -- that's incorporated q4 guide. seen q3 q4 -- sorry, q2 q3, excuse me, better expectations, still year-over-year basis. want make sure sort confusing comparative set year-over-year versus relative expectations. sanjit singh -- analyst understood. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer core it, sanjit, question really underlying usage applications. sanjit singh -- analyst yeah, make total sense. then, dev, ask ai agent question. term ai agent needing context, going set tool take actions. mean mongodb operational data store customer start roll agentic applications? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. so, talk agents, think think agents, there's jobs, there's -- sorry, there's job, there's project there's task. right now, agent rolled really focused task like say something sierra company rolling agents. right, deemed deal able create rich complex data structures. important ai ai model look isolated data points, need understand relationships, hierarchies, pattern within data. need able essentially get real-time insights. example, chatbot someone querying, customer kind trying get update order placed five minute ago may gotten confirmation, chatbot need able deal real-time information. need able deal basically handling advanced use cases, understanding like, thing like fraud detection understand behavior supply chains, need understand intricate data relationships. thing consistent mongodb offers. believe end day, well-positioned handle this. thing would say embedded natural way search vector search. oltp database, tech search vector search. that's one experience platform offer that, think real advantage. integrated leading ai framework platforms. enterprise-grade security compliance, customer run u anywhere, either 118 cloud region on-prem, huge differentiator us. sanjit singh -- analyst awesome. appreciate thoughts, dev. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, sanjit. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line taylor -- tyler radke citi. line open. tyler radke -- analyst hi, thank much taking question. and, michael, best, congratulation 10 years. going back sale execution, mean, one thing talked earlier year challenge term recently acquired workload ramping. think lot past fiscal year. curious quality workload acquisition trended year. think ramp consumption potential next year, sort look versus time year ago? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. maybe talk change made michael talk little bit consumption trends. so, make change beginning year, really wanted focus volume quality workload slight adjustment made. think change reasonable positive impact. again, early declare victory workload usually start small grow time, really pleased result seeing far. -- again, early days. obviously, know fiscal '25 workload go fiscal '26. far, good. michael, consumption? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, couple things, thanks, tyler. fiscal '24 cohort called earlier, slower growth continue. line revised expectations. made change talked -- earlier year affect fiscal '25 cohorts, early tell. those, need quarter data really see -- seeing behave differently. say talked new business environment success new business. pleased that, show kind initial piece, need see grow cohort evolve. tyler radke -- analyst great. thanks. follow-up ea side, talked outsized strength non-atlas business quarter. maybe could unpack like relative upside driven simply duration versus new business. know called duration impact year-over-year, -- feel like sort one-off feel like maybe bigger customer indexing toward ea impact way think product introducing thing like vector search stream processing onto on-prem product? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah, thank you. overall, continue find ea product resonate customers. important part run anywhere strategy continued see success people wanting increase investment mongodb. there's always multiyear component continue see that. talked beginning year fiscal '24 abnormally high amount multi-year benefit therefore, anticipating headwind quantified roughly $40 million range. talked call earlier saw large accounts, surprising amount multiyear positively benefited q3 little $15 million revenue compared saw q3 year ago. so, much headwind expecting. obviously, 606 dynamics, things, especially large deal kind meaty chunky lumpy, try call sort help people understand, there's pretty healthy kind baseline flow, ea, also multiyear. see spikes, try call you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. want add, tyler, investing call ea business. first, starting investing search vector search community product. couple thing us. one, whenever anyone start mongodb open-source product, immediately get benefit complete highly integrated platform. two, capability migrate ea. so, ea u investment strategy. definitely see lot large customer very, committed running workload on-prem. even see customer want run run ai workload on-prem. so, optionality get using mongodb on-prem cloud, also cross-cloud compelling one. tyler radke -- analyst thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line brad reback stifel. line open. brad reback -- analyst great. thanks much. and, michael, best luck. great run. dev, started call talking bunch investments, great given growth business. obviously, talked reallocating expenses. net-net, think incremental investment phase next year gating margin upside? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer think that's something obviously ready talk next year now, would say -- reason looking invest summarize again, going up-market legacy app modernization see large workload potentially play ideal database genai apps, future important investment drive long-term growth. quite energized investment that's something high conviction on. brad reback -- analyst that's great. maap program, workload going wind atlas healthy combination ea atlas? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer think early days. would say -- would probably say side atlas ea early days. think introduce search vector search ea product, see on-prem. obviously, people use mongodb ai workload using technology well conjunction mongodb on-prem ai use cases. would say probably going see happen first atlas. brad reback -- analyst great. thanks much. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line jason ader william blair. line open. jason ader -- analyst yeah, thank you. going belabor congratulating michael, fun working best luck. question strength ea. think, dev, represents comment enterprise might rethinking reassessing kind on-prem versus cloud workload placement decision? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer well, think large enterprises, think large enterprise meaningful workload still running on-prem. think belief everything would go cloud probably something really popular good old day zurp. think customer assess investment already place, much judicious run workload think leverage existing investment infrastructure, going so. also bunch reason like regulatory reasons, customer quite moving aggressively cloud. see particularly europe, see lot european bank still running majority workload on-prem. also varies region conversely asia, seeing people much move much aggressively cloud. think really depends industry, geography, personal dynamic what's happening particular account. mean, see large u bank also committed running thing on-prem. really varies. that's feel really good run anywhere strategy give customer optionality. build something run on-prem. choose move cloud, easy mongodb. jason ader -- analyst right. follow-up also investment making strategic sale enterprise. could get little specific investment might be? hiring lot new salespeople? working sis, investing sis? additional detail would helpful. thanks. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. everyone's benefit, identified number accounts, call strategic accounts, think high upside us. seen number account grow quickly deploy right mix resources. necessarily quota-carrying resources. could additional technical sale resources, additional p resources, additional customer service resource better service support accounts. even thing like run education session developer accounts, called either hackathons like call developer day even design review meet development team looking build application, help think would potentially use mongodb build particular app. find many developers, experience mongodb quite limited, engage them, educate show simple easy is. like example, customer today think like use oltp database, search database, maybe vector database, like caching database. integrated mongodb. sudden, customer say, wow, simplify life, simplify back-end infrastructure, build app far quickly much easier manage long-term everything mongodb. really function educating power mongodb really open lot opportunity us. that's doubling down, mix resource really predicated accounts, quota counting resources, whole suite resource bringing table. jason ader -- analyst thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line andrew nowinski well fargo. line open. andrew nowinski -- analyst okay. good afternoon. thank much taking question congrats nice quarter. gave example customer migrated postgres think said issue pg vector function. wondering long customer using postgres decided make change mongo, meaning sort like rebound type customer chose pg -- excuse me, postgres work? frequently seeing type transition? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. can't give specific long using postgres, -- trend seeing business. remember postgres 40-year-old technology. -- beneficiary people lifting shifting type relational databases, oracle, sql server, mysql, et cetera. open-source database. part -- open-source relational database, inherent challenge relational database do. quite inflexible. build schema, hard change schema. hard scale hard distribute data. large data volumes, weird thing like, example, resort off-road storage large data objects, creates performance bottlenecks. again, people default postgres know anything better know relational everyone kind moving relational platforms. that's whole point saying earlier. educate developer flexibility schema, easily horizontally scale rich query language aggregation sophisticated geospatial indexes, productivity gain using document model easy organize data, -- people like, wow, life much easier. want clear, zero-sum game. postgres fail u successful. big market quite excited opportunity, see customer moving postgres coming mongodb. andrew nowinski -- analyst thank you. helpful. maybe quick follow-up. normalize $15 million multiyear deal impact q3, would ea still sequentially q4? thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer given level guidance, trying help understand context full-year number headwind talked beginning year, given strength saw q3. andrew nowinski -- analyst got it. thanks. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line raimo lenschow barclays. line open. raimo lenschow -- analyst hey, thank you. think ea strength quarter, michael, kind give u little bit there. like think renewal -- renewal situation renewal pool coming like q3, coming q4, et cetera, well like mean term upsell, cross-sell opportunity people think starting ai project self-serve, kind mentioned earlier call? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. think -- think ea q4, tends large renewal quarter, talking term guide strength multiyear, that's would expect see ea sequentially, typically pattern, called out. term ai workload things, think early tell obviously, continue evolve assess view get full-year guide march. also updated view cohort behaving sort multiyear played out. think term q4, comment made earlier hopefully help. raimo lenschow -- analyst yeah. okay, perfect. -- talk little bit like obviously, there's debate like database persistent layer ai projects, et cetera. see big hyperscalers term working guy partnerships? obviously aws kind summit, et-cetera. speak little bit like relationship big guy evolving around this? michael, best case talk you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. so, start partnership first, like -- aws, said, re:invent show last week. -- remains very, strong. closed ton deal past quarter. very, large deals. integration new product like q bedrock engagement field really strong. azure, think -- shared past, start-off little bit slow start, word person run partner leadership, azure mongodb relationship never stronger. closed large number deals. part what's called azure native ic service program bunch deep integration azure, including fabric, power bi, visual studio, semantic kernel, azure openai studio. also one azure's largest marketplace partners. gcp -- actually seen uptick term co-sales done past quarter gcp made comp change -- favorable working mongodb saw result field, focused closing -- closing handful large deal gcp q4. general, would say, thing going quite well. term of, guess, implying question like hyperscalers potentially bundling thing along ai offerings? mean, candidly, since day one, hyperscalers bundling database offering every offering that's predominant strategy. -- think executed well strategy database like by-the-way decision. important decision. think hyperscalers seeing performance realize better partner us. said, customer understand importance data layer, especially ai applications. partnership across three hyperscalers strong. raimo lenschow -- analyst ok, perfect. thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer thanks, raimo. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line brad sill bank america. line open. brad sill -- analyst great. thank much, congratulations, michael, next move. wanted ask new workload vector search, stream processing, relational migrator. one three that's ramping faster maybe expected? little bit color new workload type ramping. thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. kind give rundown -- mean, essentially asking new products, like -- search, introduced new capability called atlas search nodes, asymmetrically scale search node search-intensive use case, scale node become quite expensive. seen kind groundbreaking capability really well received. demand quite high customer like tune configuration unique need search requirements. one world's largest bank using atlas search provide like google-like search experience payment data massive corporate customers. customer-facing application performance, scalability critical. leading provider ai-powered accounting software us atlas search power invoice analytics future, allows end user finance team perform ad-hoc analysis easily find past-due invoice voice contain errors. search -- vector search, -- again, kind first full-year since going generally available. product uptake actually very, high. q3, released quantization atlas vector search, reduces memory requirement 96%, allowing u support larger vector workload vastly improved price performance. example, multinational news organization created genai powered tool designed help producer journalist efficiently search, summarize, verify information vast varied data sources. leading security firm using atlas vector search fight ai fraud leading global medium company replaced elastic search hybrid search vector search use case user recommendation engine that's built suggest -- that's built suggest article end users. that's super exciting see well. also seeing lot interest streaming product, demand high. rolled another hyperscaler, customer commenting use case able embed stream processing mongodb make life much easier. overall, quite pleased progress making new products. said before, natively bundling capability really reduces eliminates need customer bolt bunch different technology solve problem, saving lot time, money, cost, risk. brad sill -- analyst that's really exciting. thanks, dev. wanted ask question around cedric's appointment. focus may different leadership thinking going forward? thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer no, cedric cro for, gosh, like think like five, six years, -- interim cro three quarter took last made change really expansion responsibilities. known cedric long time. worked multiple different companies. think good barometer understanding sale leadership. there's number sale leader worked top-tier software company used work me. super-excited role cedric going take also making change cedric better align different organization tightly work together going up-market, app monetization positioning well ideal database genai apps. brad sill -- analyst super exciting. thanks, dev. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer thanks, brad. operator thank you. one moment next question, please. next question coming line mike cikos needham company. line open. mike cikos -- analyst hey guys, thanks taking question here. wanted come back consumption growth slightly better expectation second quarter row now. apology missed it, improvement seeing, across vintage geography potentially concentrated scope? trying get better understanding what's seeking place what's embedded guide. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. no, would describe broad-based, mike. obviously, pleased see continuing monitoring slicing dicing different ways. information insight you, share it. without trying throw whole bunch cold water mind, slightly better, step-function changed better, good see. mike cikos -- analyst terrific. maybe quick follow-up dev. think build maybe tyler's question top q&a, cited customer thinking workload holistically even looking run ai workload on-prem. much think function customer still trying figure optimize latency cost demonstration really early phase exploratory phase versus going production? way coarse two necessarily connected? thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer no, think kind little bit both. think customer committed running big part estate on-prem. definition, going build ai workload, run on-prem, mean also need access gpus that. customer leveraging basically renting gpus cloud provider building ai workloads. think very, early days. still learning, experimenting. more-and-more apps entering production. said prepared remarks, thousand workload -- ai workload running mongodb, small percentage demonstrated meaningful product market fit. initial traction kind still small. think people get sophisticated ai, ai technology matures becomes useful, think application -- start seeing application take-off. kind chuckled today see senior leader bragging chip using versus apps building. tell still very, early day big platform shift. mike cikos -- analyst great point. thank again, guys. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, mike. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line eric heath keybanc. line open. eric heath -- analyst hi, thanks taking question. dev, michael, sound like takeaway call greater focus ea enterprise. structurally rethink ea business differently think healthy double-digit growth business going forward foreseeable future? could ask follow-up question separate that. michael, understand still early identify fiscal '25 cohort workloads, curious high-level look feel like higher quality fiscal '24 cohort workflow. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer want take first one term ea... michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, mean, would say, mean, committed run anywhere strategy. said, first investing community many customer first way experience mongodb. want full experience integrating search vector search core product. gate really start building applications. transition building capability ea. so, clearly investing ea product. atlas still big, big part business big, big part growth engine typically launch new feature atlas capability already have, fact multi-cloud make very, compelling offering many customers. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. think term workloads, think early. reminder folks, tend start small, although grow quickly. think thing add is, pretty consistent pleased new business done. need time let cohort play track them. think like said, happy new business winning. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line william power baird. line open. brian raferty denyeau -- investor relation there, william? william power -- analyst sorry, yeah. thank you. dev, encouraging comment relational migrator. wonder could touch think driving higher interest here. mean, sound like ai contributing helping, great get color still feel like obviously meaningful long-term opportunity. maybe second part question dev michael, great get framework around professional service investments. way kind think quantification timing that? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. reason excited opportunity go legacy application that, one, seems like there's confluence event happening. one increasing cost tax supporting managing legacy apps going enough. second, many customer regulated industries, regulator calling -- fact running legacy apps systemic risk, longer kick road. third, also longer kick around, vendor going end-of-life, make decision migrate application modern tech stack. fourth, genai predicated data build competitive advantage, need leverage proprietary data, people want access data able easily. that's another reason want modernize. also people built application retiring longer firm, creates risk companies. given that, customer incredibly interested figuring way easily safely securely migrate -- applications. always could help easily move data map schema relational schema document schema. hardest part essentially rewriting application. advent genai, significantly reduce time. one, use genai analyze existing code. two, use genai reverse engineer test test code does. three, use genai build new code user test ensure new code produce result old code. time effort suddenly cut meaningful way that's suddenly creating lot interest customer saying, goodness. already relational app, moving another relational app feel like modernization. so, advantage moving mongodb give much modern platform, much agile, flexible, performant, scalable platform future needs. that's excited. again, early days. run number pilot gone well. process working customer migration process. take time very, complex applications. actually, one thing also mentioned going -- saying go tertiary tier 2 tier 3 application, saying, hey, want look crown jewel apps painful us. that's also exciting. again, take time, committed this, think going drive -- help u drive long-term -- meaningful long-term growth. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, will. last part question professional service investment, really building capacity order meet demand seeing relative opportunity. calling particular gross margin impact that's typically show up. maybe last thing probably obvious, sort underscore reason though arr, right, drive new workloads, additional workload mongodb part migration. time, talked before, hope expect able leverage technology more, least initially medium-term, there's going healthy human/services component that. wanted sort effectively telegraph folks. william power -- analyst that's helpful. thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, will. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line rudy kessinger da davidson. please go ahead. rudy kessinger -- analyst hey guys, thanks squeezing here. believe last quarter said consumption growth slightly ahead expectations. slower year-over-year growth versus q2 last year, year-over-year growth improve q1. so, guess curious q3, could make comment regard? obviously, slower year-over-year basis q3 last year, stable year-over-year consumption growth q2 better worse? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. rudy, thanks question. specifically called relative q2. see lower year-over-year growth called out. see seasonal rebound. usually q3 stronger q2 talked smaller prior year. hopefully, help triangulate. rudy kessinger -- analyst okay. quick follow-up. believe q4 call back march. point, dev, said would least another year ai application deployed scale. sound like commentary early large workloads, thousands, many large scale. guess, expectation maybe still least another year seeing broad ai application rollouts scale? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. think lot function what's happening r&d side ai, right? example, today, compelling model designed phones, right, today phone computing horsepower run complex models. so, see ton very, successful

Welcome to the MongoDB third-quarter fiscal year 2025 conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there'll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your speaker for today, Brian Denyeau. Please go ahead. Brian Raferty Denyeau -- Investor Relations Thank you, Lisa. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today to review MongoDB's third-quarter fiscal 2025 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued after the close of the market today. Joining me the call today are Dev Ittycheria, president and CEO of MongoDB; and Michael Gordon, MongoDB's COO and CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our market and future growth opportunities, our expectations for the macroeconomic environment in fiscal 2025 and the impact of AI, the benefits of our product platform, our competitive landscape, customer behaviors, our financial guidance, and our planned investments in growth opportunities in AI. These statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including the results of operations and financial condition that cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. For a discussion of the material risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please refer to the risks described in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 31st, 2024 that we filed with the SEC on August 30th, 2024. Any forward-looking statements made on this call reflect our views only as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them except as required by law. Additionally, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures on this conference call. Please refer to the tables in our earnings release in the Investor Relations portion of our website for a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dev. Dev? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we had a strong quarter of new business and executed well against our large market opportunity. Let's begin by reviewing our third quarter results before giving you a broader company update. We generated revenue of $529 million, a 22% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew 26% year-over-year, representing 68% of total revenue. We generated non-GAAP operating income of $101 million for a 19% non-GAAP operating margin and we ended the quarter with over 52,600 customers. Overall, we were pleased with our performance in the third quarter. We had a strong new business quarter and we're happy with our new workload acquisition on Atlas. Our non-Atlas business significantly exceeded expectations in part because we benefited from a few large multi-year deals as customers continue to value our run anywhere strategy and want to build a deeper longer-term relationship with MongoDB. Atlas consumption was slightly better than expected in a macro-environment that we would characterize as largely consistent with what we saw in the first half of the year. Michael will cover consumption trends in more detail. Retention rates remained strong in Q3, demonstrating the mission criticality of our platform. On our Q1 earnings call, we shared with you the three major strategic initiatives that we believe will enable us to maximize our long-term opportunity. I want to give you an update on the progress we're making on those initiatives. First, we are increasing our investment in the enterprise channel since we see the strongest returns in this part of the market. Specifically, we're expanding our strategic account program going to next year, as we see more accounts that will benefit from incremental investment. In addition, we're investing time and resources to educate developers in large enterprise accounts and uplevel their MongoDB skills. These organizations have thousands of developers and as we penetrate them more deeply, we encounter developers who have historically only built SQL applications and simply do not know how to use MongoDB to its full potential. In our experience, educating these developers on the benefits of MongoDB drives significant incremental adoption of our platform. To fund these up-market investments, we are reallocating a portion of our mid-market investments. The mid-market remains an attractive opportunity for us, but we believe that prioritizing investment up-market will deliver strong returns in the current environment. We also believe there are additional ways to serve the mid-market more efficiently through our self-serve channel and other scaled technology-enabled sales and customer service motions. Second, we are optimistic about the opportunity to accelerate legacy app modernization using AI and are investing more in this area. As you recall, we ran a few successful pilots earlier this year, demonstrating that AI tooling combined with professional services and our relational migrator product can significantly reduce the time, cost, and risk of migrating legacy applications onto MongoDB. While it's early days, we have observed a more than 50% reduction in the cost to modernize. On the back of these strong early results, additional customer interest is exceeding our expectations. Large enterprises in every industry and geography are experiencing acute pain from their legacy infrastructure and are eager for more agile, performant, and cost-effective solutions. Not only are customers excited to engage with us, they also want to focus on some of the most important applications in their enterprise, further demonstrating the level of interest and size of the long-term opportunity. As relational applications encompass a wide variety of database types, programming languages, versions, and other customer-specific variables, we expect modernization projects to continue to include meaningful service engagements in the short and medium term. Consequently, we're increasing our professional services delivery capabilities, both directly and through partners. In the long run, we expect to automate and simplify large parts of the modernization process. To that end, we are leveraging the learnings from early service engagement to develop new tools to accelerate future modernization efforts. Although it's early days and scaling our legacy app modernization capabilities will take time, we have increased conviction that this motion will significantly add to our growth in the long term. Third, we are investing to capitalize on our inherent technical advantages as a key component of the emerging AI tech stack. As a reminder, MongoDB is uniquely equipped to query rich and complex data structures typical of AI applications. The ability of a database to query rich and complex data structures is crucial because AI applications often rely on highly detailed, interrelated, and nuanced data to make accurate predictions and decisions. For example, a recommendation system doesn't just analyze a single customer's purchase but also considers their browsing history, peer group behavior, and product categories requiring a database that can query and interlink these complex data structures. In addition, MongoDB's architecture unifies source data, metadata, operational data, and vector data in an all-in-one platform, updating the need for multiple database systems and complex back-end architectures. This enables a more compelling developer experience than any other alternative. From what we see in the AI market today, most customers are still in the experimental stage as they work to understand the effectiveness of the underlying tech stack and build early proof-of-concept applications. However, we are seeing an increasing number of AI apps in production. Today, we have thousands of AI apps on our platform. What we don't yet see is many of these apps actually achieving meaningful product market fit and therefore significant traction. In fact, as you take a step back and look at the entire universe of AI apps, a very small percentage of them have achieved the type of scale that we commonly see with enterprise-specific applications. We do have some AI apps that are growing quickly, including one that is already a seven-figure workload that has grown 10 times since the beginning of the year. Similar to prior platform shifts as the usefulness of AI tech improves and becomes more cost-effective, we will see the emergence of many more AI apps that do nail product market fit, but it's difficult to predict when that will happen more broadly. We remain confident that we will capture our fair share of these successful AI applications as we see that our platform is popular with developers building more sophisticated AI use cases. We continue investing in our product capabilities, including enterprise-grade Atlas Vector Search functionality to build on this momentum and even better position MongoDB to capture the AI opportunity. In addition, as previously announced, we are bringing search and vector service to our community and EA offerings, leveraging our run anywhere competitive advantage in the world of AI. Finally, we are expanding our MongoDB AI applications program or MAAP, which helps enterprise customers build and bring AI applications into production by providing them with reference architectures, integrations with leading tech providers, and coordinated services and support. Last week, we announced a new code of partners including McKinsey, Confluent, Capgemini, and Unstructured, as well as the collaboration with Meta to enable developers to build AI-enriched applications on MongoDB using Llama. Next, I'd like to provide you with a brief product update. At our dot local developer conference in London in October, we announced the general availability of MongoDB 8.0, the fastest and most performant version of MongoDB ever. MongoDB 8.0 performs 20% to 60% better against common industry benchmarks compared to our prior version and is built to exceed our customers' most stringent security, resiliency, availability, and performance requirements. To best serve our customers, we regularly review and reprioritize investments in our product portfolio to ensure we're allocating our resources to products with the highest demand from our customers. And to do that, we also deprecate products that are not showing results we desired. Consequently, we made the decision to consolidate our Atlas serverless offerings with our smallest dedicated tiers to create Atlas Flex customers, a new offering with a simpler architecture that provides the elasticity features akin to serverless. We will begin migrating effective customers to the single, simple, entry-level solution in Q4. We also decided to deprecate Atlas DeviceSync and other capabilities not widely adopted in order to focus our engineering resources on the core platform. While these reprioritization decisions are not made lightly, they allow us to deliver the most value to the largest number of customers, reinforcing our commitment to being the best modern database and helping us to grow faster. Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the adoption trends of MongoDB across our customer base. Customers across industries and around the world are running mission-critical projects in MongoDB Atlas, leveraging the full power of our developer data platform, including Financial Times, CarGurus, and Victoria's Secret. As part of the digital transformation journey, global specialty retailer Victoria's Secret & Company migrated its e-commerce platform to MongoDB Atlas. As a fully managed platform, MongoDB Atlas allowed the company to simplify its architecture and improve performance, supporting the retailer to provide a resilient, secure, and fast web and mobile e-commerce experience for their millions of customers around the world. Allianz, Alphamad, Swiss Post, and Paylocity are turning to MongoDB to modernize applications. Paylocity, a leading provider of cloud-based payroll and human capital management software, selected MongoDB to power proprietary application aimed at fostering employee connections and engagement. When traffic increased and the original SQL-based solution was unable to keep up with the required performance metrics, Paylocity migrated to MongoDB Atlas to take advantage of the flexible schema architecture, performance, and scalability. MongoDB costs five times less than the previous SQL database solution and the company's developers can now create an application within minutes, something that used to take weeks. Mature companies and start-ups alike are using MongoDB to help deliver the next wave of AI-powered application to customers, including NerdWallet, Cisco, and Tealbook. Tealbook, a supplier intelligence platform, migrated from Postgres, pgvector, and ElasticSearch to MongoDB to eliminate technical debt and consolidate their tech stack. The company experienced workload isolation and scalability issues in pgvector and were concerned with the search index inconsistencies, which were all resolved with the migration to MongoDB. With Atlas Vector search and dedicated search nodes, Tealbook has realized improved cost-efficiency and increased scalability for the supplier data platform, an application that uses GenAI to collect, verify, and enrich supplier data across various sources. In summary, we had a healthy Q3 with both Atlas and EA exceeding expectations. We saw a strong new business quarter and we remain confident in our ability to become an increasing strategic provider in our large and growing market. Looking forward, we see a great opportunity to grow our adoption in the enterprise through new workloads, modernizing legacy applications, and winning the next generation of AI-powered applications. I would like to finish by providing an update on our senior leadership. First, as we announced early in the press release, after nearly 10 years, Michael Gordon has made the decision to leave MongoDB. Michael has been instrumental in MongoDB's success over the past decade, leading our successful IPO, helping us grow our revenue nearly 50-fold, and scaling -- and successfully scaling our business model to generate meaningful operating leverage. He has been a trusted advisor and business partner to the Board and me over the years and also has become a personal friend. Michael is excited to take a well-deserved break. We have commenced the search for Michael's replacement and will be evaluating both internal and external candidates. One of Michael's proudest compliments -- accomplishments has been building a world-class finance team under his leadership, and I'm confident that we will not miss a beat during this transition. Michael will continue to serve as CFO through January 31st to help us finish the fiscal year and then will transition to an Advisor to the company to ensure a seamless process. If we have not named Michael's successor by fiscal year-end, Serge Tanjga, SVP of Finance, will serve as Interim CFO, beginning on February 1st. Second, we are promoting Cedric Pech, currently our chief revenue officer to the newly created role of president worldwide field operations. In this new position, Cedric will oversee all our field-based customer-facing and go-to-market enablement teams, including professional services. We believe this org structure will best enable us to execute on some of the key strategic initiatives I discussed earlier, in particular, our increased focus on up-market and the app monetization opportunity. I would like to congratulate Cedric on this well-deserved promotion. With that, let me turn the call over to Michael. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Dev, and thanks for the kind words and our incredible partnership over the past decade. The past 10 years have been the most rewarding in my professional career and I'm extremely proud of what we've achieved together and of course, to the whole MongoDB team. With as much success as we had, I still believe that MongoDB is in the early stages of realizing its full potential as it continues to take share in one of the largest markets in software. Now, turning to the results for the quarter. I'll begin with a detailed review of our third-quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025. First, I'll start with our third quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $529.4 million, up 22% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance. Shifting to our product mix, Atlas grew 26% in the quarter compared to the previous year and now represents 68% of total revenue compared to 66% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and 71% last quarter. We recognized Atlas revenue primarily based on customer consumption of our platform and that consumption is closely tied to end user activity of their applications. Let me provide some context on Atlas consumption in the quarter. In Q3, consumption was slightly ahead of our expectations. This year's Q3 seasonal improvement was more muted than in years past as expected. On a year-over-year basis, consumption growth remains below that of prior year period. Turning to non-Atlas revenue. Non-Atlas came in significantly ahead of our expectations. As Dev mentioned, EA new business was strong, and we continue to have success selling incremental workloads into our existing customer base. In addition, our Q3 non-Atlas revenue benefited from a few large multi-year deals. As you know, due to ASC 606, we recognized the entire term license component of a multi-year contract at the start of that contract. Compared to Q3 of last year, the multi-year license component of non-Atlas revenues was over $15 million higher. Turning to customer growth. During the third quarter, we grew our customer base by approximately 1,900 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 52,600, which is up from over 46,400 in the year-ago period. Of our total customer count, over 7,400 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 6,900 in the year-ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven primarily by Atlas, which had over 51,100 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 44,900 in the year-ago period. It is important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers adding their first Atlas workload. Continuing on, in Q3, our net ARR expansion rate was approximately 120%. We ended the quarter with 2,314 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, up from $1,972 in the year-ago period. Moving down the income statement, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the third quarter was $405.7 million, representing a gross margin of 77%, which is flat versus the year-ago period. Our income from operations was $101.5 million or 19% operating margin for the third quarter compared to an 18% operating margin in the year-ago period. The primary reason for more favorable operating income results versus guidance is our revenue outperformance, including the very high margin multi-year license revenue benefit. Net income in the third quarter was $98.1 million or $1.16 per share, based on 84.2 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a net income of $79.1 million or $0.96 per share on 83.7 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding in the year-ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the third quarter with $2.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $37.4 million. After taking into consideration approximately $2.9 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was $34.6 million in the quarter. This compares to free cash flow of $35 million in the year-ago period. In Q3, we did not incur capital expenditures to purchase IPV4 addresses as we previously expected, but we did start making those purchases in November and still expect a total outlay of $20 million to $25 million this fiscal year as we previously communicated. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $515 million to $519 million. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $55 million to $58 million and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.65 based on 84.9 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. For the full-fiscal year 2025, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.973 billion to $1.977 billion, non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $242 million to $245 million, and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $3.01 to $3.03 based on 84 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. Note that the non-GAAP net income per share guidance for the fourth-quarter and full-fiscal year 2025 includes a non-GAAP tax provision of approximately 20%. I'll now provide some more context around our updated guidance. First, in terms of Atlas consumption, we expect to see a typical seasonal slowdown in Q4, driven by underlying application usage moderating during the holiday season. Second, since Atlas consumption remained lower on a year-over-year basis in Q3, we expect to see continued deceleration of Atlas year-over-year growth in Q4. Third, we expect to see a sequential decline in non-Atlas revenue in Q4, which is contrary to our normal pattern. The reason for this is that we experienced a significant additional benefit from multi-year deals in Q3, which we do not expect to recur in Q4. In addition, I want to provide some incremental color on some of our recent product and -- how some of our recent product and go-to-market changes will impact the growth of our reported customer count going forward. First, as Dev explained, we are reallocating a portion of our go-to-market resources from the mid-market to the enterprise channel. As a result, we expect to see significantly fewer mid-market direct sales customer net additions and as a result, slower direct sales customer growth going forward. We believe this reallocation of investment dollars will drive higher revenue growth over time. So, it's a trade-off that makes sense. Second, as we introduce Atlas Flex clusters in Q4 and automatically migrate customers in Q1, we expect to see a one-time negative impact to our customer count since we have approximately 4,000 serverless customers who are very low spending and we do not expect them to transition over to Flex. These customers have a negligible impact on our revenue but will impact our reported customer count. To summarize, we're pleased with our third quarter results and especially our ability to win new business. We have a small share in one of the largest and fastest-growing markets in all of software with a number of secular tailwinds, including AI at our back. We'll continue investing judiciously and focusing on our execution to capture this long-term opportunity. With that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator? Questions & Answers: Operator [Operator instructions] Our first question for the day will be coming from Sanjit Singh of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Thank you for taking the questions and congrats, Michael, on outstanding career. You had an absolutely fantastic run at MongoDB. I'm excited to see what you do next, or excited if you just take a breather. So congrats, Michael. I guess to take the question -- to start off with the questions, when we look at what Atlas has been doing in the past two quarters, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think consumption is coming in at least modestly ahead of your expectations. Relative to what we've seen at the beginning of the year, what sort of -- is it a function of sales execution? Is it a function of the end-user activity sort of improving? What's driving at least the improvement in Atlas consumption in the past two quarters? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So a few different things. So I think if you look at our outlook at the beginning of the year, we had indicated that we thought we would see stable Atlas growth from a consumption standpoint. What we've seen and what we've talked about is -- we've actually seen lower year-over-year growth based on the underlying consumption. And so -- and that's incorporated into our Q4 guide. We have seen the Q3 and Q4 be -- sorry, Q2 and Q3, excuse me, be better than our expectations, but it's still down on a year-over-year basis. And so I want to make sure that we're not sort of confusing the comparative set of year-over-year versus relative to our expectations. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Understood. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer And the core of it, Sanjit, to your question is really the underlying usage of the applications. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Yeah, that makes total sense. And then, Dev, I have to ask you the AI agent question. In terms of an AI agent needing more context, it has going to have a set of tools to take its actions. What does it mean for MongoDB as an operational data store as customers start to roll out more agentic applications? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, just to talk about agents, I think when you think about agents, there's jobs, there's -- sorry, there's a job, there's projects and then there's task. Right now, the agents that are being rolled out are really focused on task like say something from Sierra or some other companies are rolling out agents. But you're right, what they deemed to do is to deal with being able to create a rich and complex data structures. Now why is this important for AI is that AI models don't just look at isolated data points, but they need to understand relationships, hierarchies, and patterns within the data. They need to be able to essentially get real-time insights. For example, if you have a chatbot where someone is querying, a customer is kind of trying to get some update on the order they placed five minutes ago because they may have not gotten any confirmation, your chatbot needs to be able to deal with real-time information. You need to be able to deal with basically handling very advanced use cases, understanding like, to do things like fraud detection to understand behaviors of supply chains, you need to understand intricate data relationships. All these things are consistent with MongoDB offers. And so we believe that at the end of the day, we are well-positioned to handle this. And the other thing that I would say is that we've embedded in a very natural way of search and vector search. So we're just not an OLTP database, we do tech search and vector search. That's all one experience and no other platform offers that, and we think we have a real advantage. And so we're integrated with the leading AI frameworks and platforms. We have enterprise-grade security and compliance, and customers can run us anywhere, either on 118 cloud regions or on-prem, and that again is a huge differentiator for us. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Awesome. Appreciate the thoughts, Dev. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Sanjit. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Taylor -- Tyler Radke of Citi. Your line is open. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Hi, thank you very much for taking the question. And, Michael, all the best, and congratulations on 10 years. Going back to the sales execution, I mean, one of the things that you talked about earlier this year was some challenges just in terms of the recently acquired workloads ramping. And I think a lot of those were from the past fiscal year. So curious how the quality of workload acquisition has trended this year. And as you think about the ramp in consumption potential into next year, how does that sort of look versus this time a year ago? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Maybe I'll just talk about what we're doing and the changes we made and then Michael can talk a little bit about the consumption trends. So, we did make some changes at the beginning of the year, and we really wanted to focus on both the volume and the quality of the workloads and there were some slight adjustments that we made. We think those changes are having a reasonable positive impact. Again, it's too early to declare victory because these workloads usually start small and grow over time, but we're really pleased with the results we're seeing so far. And -- but again, it's early days. And obviously, we'll know about the fiscal '25 workloads as we go into fiscal '26. But so far, so good. Michael, on consumption? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, just a couple of things, and thanks, Tyler. The fiscal '24 cohorts that we called out earlier, that slower growth does continue. They've been in line with our revised expectations. We made some changes that we talked about at the -- earlier in the year that should affect the fiscal '25 cohorts, but it's just too early to tell. On those, we need a few more quarters of data before you can really see if we're -- how we're seeing those behave differently. I will say we've talked about the new business environment and our success in new business. We have been pleased with that, but that just shows kind of the initial piece, and we need to see how they grow and how those cohorts evolve. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Great. Thanks. And follow-up on the EA side, you talked about the outsized strength in non-Atlas business this quarter. Maybe if you could unpack like the relative upside that was driven by simply duration versus new business. I know you called out the duration impact year-over-year, but are -- do you feel like this was sort of a one-off or do you feel like maybe some of your bigger customers are indexing more toward EA and how does that impact the way you think about the product and introducing things like vector search and stream processing onto the on-prem product? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, thank you. So overall, we continue to find the EA product resonate with customers. It's an important part of the run anywhere strategy and we've continued to see success with that and people wanting to increase their investment in MongoDB. There's always been a multiyear component and we continue to see that. We talked about that at the beginning of the year as to how fiscal '24 had an abnormally high amount of multi-year benefit and therefore, we were anticipating that being a headwind and we quantified that in roughly the $40 million range. What we talked about on this call earlier is we saw from a few large accounts, a surprising amount of multiyear that positively benefited Q3 at a little more than $15 million in revenue compared to what we saw Q3 a year ago. So, not as much of a headwind as we had been expecting. Obviously, with the 606 dynamics, some of these things, especially for a large deal can be kind of meaty and chunky and lumpy, which is why we try and call it out and sort of help people understand, but there's a pretty healthy kind of baseline flow, not just of EA, but also of multiyear. And when we see spikes, we just try and call it out for you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I just want to add, Tyler, that we are investing in our what we call our EA business. First, we're starting by investing with search and vector search and a community product. That does a couple of things for us. One, whenever anyone starts with MongoDB with the open-source product, they immediately get all the benefits of that complete highly integrated platform. Two, those capabilities will then migrate to EA. So, EA for us is an investment strategy. We definitely see lots of large customers who are very, very committed to running workloads on-prem. We even see some customers want to run to run AI workloads on-prem. So, the optionality they get by using MongoDB to not just be on-prem and the cloud, but also cross-cloud is a very compelling one. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Brad Reback of Stifel. Your line is open. Brad Reback -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. And, Michael, best of luck. It's been a great run. Dev, you started the call talking about a bunch of investments, which are great given the growth of the business. And obviously, you talked about reallocating some expenses. But net-net, should we think about this incremental investment phase next year as gating margin upside? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think that's something that we obviously are not ready to talk about next year just now, but I would say that we -- the reason we're looking to invest and just to summarize again, going up-market on legacy app modernization where we see very large workloads potentially at play and being the ideal database for GenAI apps, which is the future as important investments to drive long-term growth. And we're quite energized by those investments and that's something that we have high conviction on. Brad Reback -- Analyst That's great. And then on the MAAP program, are most of those workloads going to wind up in Atlas or will that be a healthy combination of EA and Atlas? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think it's again early days. I would say -- I would probably say more on the side of Atlas and EA in the early days. I think once we introduce a search and vector search into the EA product, you'll see more of that on-prem. Obviously, people can use MongoDB for AI workloads using other technologies as well in conjunction with MongoDB for on-prem AI use cases. But I would say you're probably going to see that happen first in Atlas. Brad Reback -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Jason Ader of William Blair. Your line is open. Jason Ader -- Analyst Yeah, thank you. I'm not going to belabor congratulating Michael, but it has been it has been fun working with you and best of luck. The question I had is on the strength in EA. Do you think, Dev, it represents a comment on how enterprises might be rethinking or reassessing the kind of on-prem versus cloud workload placement decision? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Well, when I think about large enterprises, I think large enterprises have meaningful workloads that are still running on-prem. I think the belief that everything would go to the cloud was probably something that was really popular in the good old days of Zurp. But I think now as customers assess their investments that they already have in place, they're being much more judicious about where they run those workloads and if they think they can leverage their existing investments in their own infrastructure, then they're going to do so. Also for a bunch of other reasons like regulatory reasons, some customers are quite not moving as aggressively to the cloud. We see that in particularly in Europe, where we see a lot of the European banks still running majority of the workloads on-prem. So it also varies by region where conversely in Asia, we're seeing people much move much more aggressively to the cloud. So I think it really depends on industry, on geography, and on the personal dynamics of what's happening in that particular account. I mean, we see some large US banks are also very committed to running things on-prem. So it really varies. And that's why we feel really good about our run anywhere strategy because it gives customer optionality. They can build something and run on-prem. And if and when they choose to move to the cloud, it's very easy to do so with MongoDB. Jason Ader -- Analyst All right. And then just as a follow-up also on the investments you're making in strategic sales and enterprise. Could you just get a little more specific on what those investments might be? Is it hiring a lot of new salespeople? Is it working more with SIs, investing more in SIs? Any additional detail would be helpful. Thanks. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So just for everyone's benefit, we've identified a number of accounts, which we call strategic accounts, which we think that have high upside for us. We've seen a number of accounts that grow very quickly when we deploy the right mix of resources. Now they're all not necessarily quota-carrying resources. They could be additional technical sales resources, additional PS resources, additional customer service resources to better service and support those accounts. We even do things like run education sessions for developers of the accounts, they're called either hackathons or like what we call developer days or even design reviews where we'll meet with our development teams who are looking to build an application, help them think about how they would potentially use MongoDB to build that particular app. And what we find is that because many of these developers, the experience with MongoDB is quite limited, the more we can engage with them, the more we can educate them and the more we can show them how simple and easy it is. Like for example, most customers today think like they have to use an OLTP database, then a search database, maybe a vector database, and then like a caching database. And all that is integrated in MongoDB. So all of a sudden, customers can say, wow, I can simplify my life, simplify my back-end infrastructure, build this app far more quickly and it will be much more easier to manage long-term if I do everything on MongoDB. And it's really a function of just educating them on the power of MongoDB that really opens up a lot of opportunities for us. So that's why we're doubling down, and the mix of resources is really predicated on the accounts, but it's not just quota counting resources, it's the whole suite of resources that we're bringing to the table. Jason Ader -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Andrew Nowinski of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Okay. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking the question and congrats on a nice quarter. You gave an example of a customer that migrated off Postgres and I think you said they had issues with their PG vector function. I was wondering how long was that customer using Postgres before they decided to make a change to Mongo, meaning was this some sort of like a rebound type customer where they chose PG -- or excuse me, Postgres and it didn't work? And then how frequently are you seeing this type of transition? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So I can't give you the specifics on how long they were using Postgres, but this is not -- this is a trend that we're seeing in our business. You have to remember Postgres is a 40-year-old technology. It's -- and they have been the beneficiary of people lifting and shifting from other types of relational databases, Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, et cetera. And they're an open-source database. And but as part -- because they're an open-source and relational database, they have the same inherent challenges all relational databases do. They're quite inflexible. So once you build a schema, it's very hard to change the schema. It's hard to scale and hard to distribute data. And if you have large data volumes, you have to do weird things like, for example, resort to off-road storage for large data objects, which creates performance bottlenecks. And so again, people default to Postgres if they don't know anything better because all they know is relational and everyone is kind of moving off those other relational platforms. And that's the whole point I was saying earlier. Once we educate developers on the flexibility of schema, how easily or horizontally scale the rich query language where you can do aggregations and do sophisticated geospatial indexes, the productivity gains by using the document model and how easy is to organize data, it's -- people are just like, wow, life is so much easier. Now I want to be clear, this is not a zero-sum game. Postgres does not have to fail for us to be successful. It's a big market and we're quite excited about the opportunity, but we do see customers moving off Postgres and coming to MongoDB. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Thank you. That was very helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up. If we normalize the $15 million multiyear deal impact you had in Q3, would EA still be down sequentially in Q4? Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer We haven't given that level of guidance, but just trying to help you understand in the context of the full-year numbers and the headwind that we talked about at the beginning of the year, just given the strength that we saw in Q3. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Got it. Thanks. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. The next question will be coming from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst Hey, thank you. And if you think about the EA strength this quarter, Michael, you'd kind of give us a little bit there. Like how should we think about renewal -- the renewal situation renewal pool coming up like or that you had in Q3, coming up in Q4, et cetera, as well and then like what does it mean in terms of upsell, cross-sell opportunity as people think about starting AI projects by self-serve, as you kind of mentioned earlier on the call? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So I think about -- if you think about EA for Q4, it tends to be a large renewal quarter, but what we're talking about in terms of the guide is because we had such strength in multiyear, that's where we would expect to see our EA down sequentially, which is not typically our pattern, which is why we called it out. In terms of AI workloads and some of those other things, I think it's early to tell and obviously, we'll continue to evolve and assess our view when we get to the full-year guide in March. And then we'll also have an updated view on how the cohorts are behaving and sort of how multiyear played out. But I think in terms of Q4, the comments that I made earlier hopefully will help. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst Yeah. Okay, perfect. And then the -- and can you talk a little bit about like obviously, there's a debate of like which database will be the persistent layer if you do AI projects, et cetera. What do you see from the big hyperscalers in terms of working with you guys and partnerships? We obviously just have AWS kind of summit, et-cetera. Can you speak a little bit like how your relationship with those big guys is evolving around this? And Michael, All the best in case I don't talk to you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, I'll start with the partnerships first, like our -- with AWS, as you said, they just had their re:Invent show last week. Our -- it remains very, very strong. We've closed a ton of deals this past quarter. Some of them very, very large deals. We're doing integrations to some of the new products like Q and Bedrock and the engagement in the field has been really strong. On Azure, I think we -- as I've shared in the past, we start-off with a little bit of a slow start, but in the words of the person who runs their partner leadership, the Azure MongoDB relationship has never been stronger. We've closed a large number of deals. We're part of what's called the Azure native IC service program and have a bunch of deep integrations with Azure, including Fabric, Power BI, Visual Studio, Semantic Kernel, and Azure OpenAI Studio. And we're also one of Azure's largest marketplace partners. And GCP does -- we have actually seen some uptick in terms of co-sales that we've done this past quarter and GCP made some comp changes where they -- that were favorable to working with MongoDB that we saw some results in the field, and we're focused on closing on -- closing a handful of large deals with GCP in Q4. So in general, I would say, things are going quite well. And then in terms of, I guess, implying your question was like the hyperscalers and are they potentially bundling things along with their AI offerings? I mean, candidly, since day one, the hyperscalers have been bundling their database offerings with every offering that they have and that's been their predominant strategy. And we've -- I think we've executed well against strategy because databases are not like a by-the-way decision. It's an important decision. And I think the hyperscalers are seeing our performance and realize it's better to partner with us. And as I said, customers understand the importance of the data layer, especially for AI applications. And so the partnership across all three hyperscalers is strong. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst OK, perfect. Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Raimo. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. The next question will be coming from the line of Brad Sills of Bank of America. Your line is open. Brad Sills -- Analyst Great. Thank you so much, and congratulations, Michael, on your next move. I wanted to ask about new workloads here on vector search, stream processing, relational migrator. Is there any one of those three that's ramping faster than maybe you expected? Just a little bit of color on how those new workload types are ramping. Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I'll kind of give you just a rundown of some of the -- I mean, essentially you're asking about the new products, like our -- on search, we introduced a new capability called Atlas search nodes, which where you can asymmetrically scale your search nodes because if you have a search-intensive use case, you don't have to scale all your nodes because they have become quite expensive. And we've seen that this kind of groundbreaking capability really well received. The demand is quite high and because customers like they can tune the configuration to the unique needs of their search requirements. One of the world's largest banks is using Atlas Search to provide like a Google-like search experience on payments data for massive corporate customers. So this is a customer-facing application and so performance, and scalability are critical. A leading provider of AI-powered accounting software uses Atlas Search to power its invoice analytics future, which allows end users and finance teams to perform ad-hoc analysis and easily find past-due invoices and voices that contain errors. So that search -- on vector search, it -- again, and it's been our kind of our first full-year since going generally available. And the product uptake has been actually very, very high. In Q3, we released quantization for Atlas Vector Search, which reduces the memory requirements by up to 96%, allowing us to support larger vector workloads with vastly improved price performance. For example, a multinational news organization created a GenAI powered tool designed to help producers and journalists efficiently search, summarize, and verify information from vast and varied data sources. A leading security firm is using Atlas Vector Search to fight AI fraud and a leading global media company replaced elastic search with hybrid search and vector search use case for a user recommendation engine that's built to suggest -- that's built in to suggest articles to end users. And so that's super exciting to see as well. We're also seeing a lot of interest in our streaming product, demand is very high. We just rolled it out to another hyperscaler, and customers are commenting on that the use cases of being able to embed stream processing with MongoDB makes our life so much easier. So overall, we're quite pleased with the progress we're making on the new products. And as I said before, natively bundling all these capabilities really reduces or eliminates the need for customers to have to bolt on a bunch of different technologies to solve the same problem, saving them a lot of time, money, cost, and risk. Brad Sills -- Analyst That's really exciting. Thanks, Dev. And then I wanted to ask a question around Cedric's appointment. Any focus that may be different here under his leadership that we should be thinking about going forward? Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer No, Cedric has been our CRO for, gosh, now like I think like five, six years, and he -- I was the Interim CRO for about three quarters until he took over when we last made a change and this is really an expansion of his responsibilities. I've known Cedric for a long time. He and I have worked with at multiple different companies. I think I have a good barometer for understanding sales leadership. There's a number of sales leaders who worked at other top-tier software companies who used to work for me or with me. And so I'm super-excited by the role Cedric is going to take and then we're also making some changes under Cedric to better align the different organizations so that we can more tightly work together on going up-market, on app monetization and positioning ourselves well to be the ideal database for GenAI apps. Brad Sills -- Analyst Super exciting. Thanks, Dev. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Brad. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question, please. Our next question will be coming from the line of Mike Cikos of Needham and Company. Your line is open. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Hey guys, thanks for taking the question here. I just wanted to come back to the consumption growth being slightly better than expectations again for the second quarter in a row now. And apologies if I missed it, but this improvement that we're seeing, is this across all vintages and geographies or is it potentially more concentrated in scope? Just trying to get a better understanding of what's seeking place out there and what's embedded in the guide. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. No, I would describe it as broad-based, Mike. And obviously, we're pleased to see it and we're continuing monitoring and slicing and dicing it in different ways. And as we have information or insights to you, we'll share it. And without trying to throw a whole bunch of cold water on our mind, it was slightly better, or a step-function changed better, but good to see. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Terrific. And maybe for a quick follow-up for Dev. I think it builds off maybe Tyler's question at the top of the Q&A, but you had cited that some customers are thinking about their workloads more holistically and even looking to run AI workloads on-prem. How much of that do you think is just a function of customers are still trying to figure out how to optimize for latency and cost or is this more a demonstration of we really are in the early phases of the exploratory phase versus going into production? Is there any way to coarse that out or is the two not necessarily connected? Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer No, I think it's kind of a little bit of both. I think you have some customers who are very committed to running a big part of the estate on-prem. So by definition, then if they're going to build an AI workload, it has to be run on-prem, which means that they also need access to GPUs and they're doing that. And then other customers are leveraging basically renting GPUs from the cloud providers and building their own AI workloads. I do think we're in the very, very early days. They're still learning, experimenting. More-and-more apps are entering production. And as I said on the prepared remarks, we have thousands of workload -- AI workloads running on MongoDB, but a very small percentage of them have demonstrated meaningful product market fit. And so the initial traction is kind of still small. But I think as people get more sophisticated with AI, as the AI technology matures and becomes more and more useful, I think applications will -- you'll start seeing these applications take-off. I kind of chuckled that today I see more senior leaders bragging about the chips they're using versus the apps they're building. So it just tells you that we're still in the very, very early days of this big platform shift. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Great point. Thank you again, guys. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Mike. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Eric Heath of KeyBanc. Your line is open. Eric Heath -- Analyst Hi, thanks for taking the question. Dev, Michael, it sounds like the takeaway from the call is a greater focus on EA and on enterprise. So should we structurally rethink the EA business differently and think of this more as a healthy double-digit growth business going forward for the foreseeable future? And then if I could just ask a follow-up question separate to that. But Michael, I understand that it's still early to identify the fiscal '25 cohort of workloads, but just curious at a high-level if they look and feel like of higher quality than the fiscal '24 cohort of workflow. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Do you want to take on the first one in terms of EA... Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, I mean, I would say, I mean, we are very committed to our run anywhere strategy. And as I said, we are first investing in community where for many customers is the first way they experience MongoDB. And we want them to have the full experience of integrating search and Vector search into our core product. And so they can out of the gate really start building applications. That will then transition to building those capabilities into EA. So, we are clearly investing in the EA product. But Atlas is still a big, big part of our business and a big, big part of our growth engine and we typically launch new features on Atlas and because of the capabilities we already have, the fact it's multi-cloud makes it a very, very compelling offering for many customers. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. And I think in terms of the workloads, I do think it's early. Just as a reminder for folks, they tend to start small, although grow quickly. I think the only other thing that I can add is, we've been pretty consistent and that we've been pleased with the new business that we've done. But we need some time to let the cohorts play out as we track them. But I think like I said, we've been happy with the new business that we were winning. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of William Power of Baird. Your line is open. Brian Raferty Denyeau -- Investor Relations You there, William? William Power -- Analyst Sorry, yeah. Thank you. Dev, you had some encouraging comments on relational migrator. I wonder if you could just touch on what you think is driving the higher interest here. I mean, it sounds like AI is contributing and helping, but it'd be great to get some more color there because that still feels like obviously a meaningful long-term opportunity. And then maybe the second part of the question for Dev or Michael, just be great to get any other framework around the professional services investments. Any way to kind of think about quantification and timing of that? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So the reason we're so excited about the opportunity to go after legacy applications is that, one, it seems like there's a confluence of events happening. One is that the increasing cost and tax of supporting and managing these legacy apps are just going up enough. Second, for many customers who are in regulated industries, the regulators are calling their -- the fact that they're running on these legacy apps with systemic risk, so they can no longer kick the can down the road. Third, also because they no longer can kick the can around, some vendors are going end-of-life, so they have to make a decision to migrate those applications to a more modern tech stack. Fourth, because GenAI is so predicated on data and to build a competitive advantage, you need to leverage your proprietary data, people want to access that data and be able to do so easily. And so that's another reason for them to want to modernize. And then you also have people who built those applications who are retiring or just no longer in the firm, so it just creates more and more risk for the companies. Given all that, customers are incredibly interested in figuring out a way to easily and safely and securely migrate those -- off those applications. And we always could help them very easily move the data and map the schema from a relational schema to a document schema. The hardest part was essentially rewriting the application. Now with the advent of GenAI, you can now significantly reduce the time. One, you can use GenAI to analyze existing code. Two, you can use GenAI to reverse engineer tests to test what the code does. And then three, you can use GenAI to build new code and then users test it to ensure that the new code produces the same results as the old code. And so all that time and effort is suddenly cut in a meaningful way and that's suddenly creating a lot of interest from customers saying, my goodness. And if you're already on a relational app, moving to another relational app doesn't feel like modernization. So, the other advantage is that moving to MongoDB gives them a much more modern platform, a much more agile, flexible, performant, and scalable platform for their future needs. And that's why we're so excited. Again, it's early days. We've run a number of pilots that have gone well. We're in the process of working with some customers now in the migration process. This will take time because these are very, very complex applications. And actually, one thing I also mentioned was that they're not just going after -- saying go after some tertiary Tier 2 or Tier 3 application, they're saying, hey, we want you to look at some of our crown jewels because these are the apps that are most painful for us. So that's also very exciting. But again, this will take time, but we're very committed to this, and we think this is going to drive -- help us drive long-term -- meaningful long-term growth. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, Will. And to the last part of your question on the professional services investment, we're really building out that capacity in order to meet the demand that we're seeing relative to the opportunity. We're calling it in particular because it has a gross margin impact because that's where that will typically show up. And then maybe the last thing and it's probably obvious, but just to sort of underscore it is the reason we're doing this though is for the ARR, right, to drive the new workloads, the additional workloads over to MongoDB as part of that migration. And over time, as we've talked about before, we hope and expect to be able to leverage technology more and more, but at least initially and into the medium-term, there's going to be a healthy human/services component to that. Just wanted to sort of effectively telegraph that out to folks. William Power -- Analyst That's helpful. Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Will. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Rudy Kessinger of DA Davidson. Please go ahead. Rudy Kessinger -- Analyst Hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in here. I believe last quarter you said consumption growth slightly ahead of expectations. And while down slower year-over-year growth versus Q2 last year, the year-over-year growth did improve from Q1. And so, I guess I'm curious for Q3, could you make a comment in that same regard? Obviously, slower on a year-over-year basis than Q3 last year, but was it stable with year-over-year consumption growth in Q2 or better or worse? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Rudy, thanks for the question. We haven't specifically called that out relative to Q2. We did see a lower year-over-year growth as we called out. We did see a seasonal rebound. Usually Q3 is stronger than Q2 and we talked about how that was smaller than in the prior year. So hopefully, that will help you all triangulate. Rudy Kessinger -- Analyst Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. I believe it was on your Q4 call back in March. At that point, Dev, you said it would be at least another year until AI applications are being deployed at scale. It sounds like the commentary that some early large workloads, but out of the thousands, just not many that are at large scale. I guess, is your expectation now that maybe it's still at least another year until we're seeing broad AI application rollouts at scale? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I think a lot of it's a function of the what's happening in the R&D side of AI, right? So for example, today, we don't have a very compelling model designed for our phones, right, because today the phones don't have the computing horsepower to run complex models. So, you don't see a ton of very, very successful consumer apps besides, say, ChatGPT or Claude. So we don't -- we also don't see like hundreds of apps taking off like you saw kind of the first generation of like the Internet or the cloud era, right, or the mobile era. So like I think we're still in the early days of AI. And so while we see a lot of people building AI apps, a lot of them have kind of fairly rudimentary functionality. But I think that over time that's going to change. In fact, I know it will change. I just can't predict when that will happen. But where we do see apps having production, we are having traction, we're seeing them grow very, very quickly and we have a lot of them on our platform. It's just very few of them are really have meaningful. Operator Thank you. And that concludes today's Q&A session. I would like to go ahead and turn the call back over to Dev for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, everyone. I just wanted to say we're really pleased with our Q3 results with strong new business performance and revenue exceeding expectations both -- across both Atlas and EA. We're making the necessary investments to expand our enterprise channel where we see the largest opportunity to establish MongoDB as a standard and the strongest returns on our go-to-market investments. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the progress we're making on both accelerating legacy app modernization with AI as well as establishing ourselves as a standard of the emerging AI tech stack for greenfield AI applications. And last but not least, I would like to thank Michael again for his contributions over the past 10 years and wish him well. Thank you, everyone, and we'll talk to you soon.

already seven-figure workload grown 10 time since beginning year. similar prior platform shift usefulness ai tech improves becomes cost-effective, see emergence many ai apps nail product market fit, difficult predict happen broadly. remain confident capture fair share successful ai application see platform popular developer building sophisticated ai use cases. continue investing product capabilities, including enterprise-grade atlas vector search functionality build momentum even better position mongodb capture ai opportunity. addition, previously announced, bringing search vector service community ea offerings, leveraging run anywhere competitive advantage world ai. finally, expanding mongodb ai application program maap, help enterprise customer build bring ai application production providing reference architectures, integration leading tech providers, coordinated service support. last week, announced new code partner including mckinsey, confluent, capgemini, unstructured, well collaboration meta enable developer build ai-enriched application mongodb using llama. next, like provide brief product update. dot local developer conference london october, announced general availability mongodb 8.0, fastest performant version mongodb ever. mongodb 8.0 performs 20% 60% better common industry benchmark compared prior version built exceed customers' stringent security, resiliency, availability, performance requirements. best serve customers, regularly review reprioritize investment product portfolio ensure allocating resource product highest demand customers. that, also deprecate product showing result desired. consequently, made decision consolidate atlas serverless offering smallest dedicated tier create atlas flex customers, new offering simpler architecture provides elasticity feature akin serverless. begin migrating effective customer single, simple, entry-level solution q4. also decided deprecate atlas devicesync capability widely adopted order focus engineering resource core platform. reprioritization decision made lightly, allow u deliver value largest number customers, reinforcing commitment best modern database helping u grow faster. now, like spend minute reviewing adoption trend mongodb across customer base. customer across industry around world running mission-critical project mongodb atlas,

promoting cedric pech, currently chief revenue officer newly created role president worldwide field operations. new position, cedric oversee field-based customer-facing go-to-market enablement teams, including professional services. believe org structure best enable u execute key strategic initiative discussed earlier, particular, increased focus up-market app monetization opportunity. would like congratulate cedric well-deserved promotion. that, let turn call michael. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer thanks, dev, thanks kind word incredible partnership past decade. past 10 year rewarding professional career extremely proud achieved together course, whole mongodb team. much success had, still believe mongodb early stage realizing full potential continues take share one largest market software. now, turning result quarter. begin detailed review third-quarter result finish outlook fourth quarter full fiscal year 2025. first, start third quarter results. total revenue quarter $529.4 million, 22% year-over-year high end guidance. shifting product mix, atlas grew 26% quarter compared previous year represents 68% total revenue compared 66% third quarter fiscal 2024 71% last quarter. recognized atlas revenue primarily based customer consumption platform consumption closely tied end user activity applications. let provide context atlas consumption quarter. q3, consumption slightly ahead expectations. year's q3 seasonal improvement muted year past expected. year-over-year basis, consumption growth remains prior year period. turning non-atlas revenue. non-atlas came significantly ahead expectations. dev mentioned, ea new business strong, continue success selling incremental workload existing customer base. addition, q3 non-atlas revenue benefited large multi-year deals. know, due asc 606, recognized entire term license component multi-year contract start contract. compared q3 last year, multi-year license component non-atlas revenue $15 million higher. turning customer growth. third quarter, grew customer base approximately 1,900 customer sequentially, bringing total customer count 52,600, 46,400 year-ago period. total customer count, 7,400 direct sale customers, compare 6,900 year-ago period. growth total customer count driven primarily atlas, 51,100 customer end quarter compared 44,900 year-ago period. important keep mind growth atlas customer count reflects new customer mongodb addition existing ea customer adding first atlas workload. continuing on, q3, net arr expansion rate approximately 120%. ended quarter 2,314 customer least $100,000 arr annualized mrr, $1,972 year-ago period. moving income statement, discussing result non-gaap basis unless otherwise noted. gross profit third quarter $405.7 million, representing gross margin 77%, flat versus year-ago period. income operation $101.5 million 19% operating margin third quarter compared 18% operating margin year-ago period. primary reason favorable operating income result versus guidance revenue outperformance, including high margin multi-year license revenue benefit. net income third quarter $98.1 million $1.16 per share, based 84.2 million diluted weighted average share outstanding. compare net income $79.1 million $0.96 per share 83.7 million diluted weighted-average share outstanding year-ago period. turning balance sheet cash flow, ended third quarter $2.3 billion cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash. operating cash flow third quarter $37.4 million. taking consideration approximately $2.9 million capital expenditure principal repayment finance lease liabilities, free cash flow $34.6 million quarter. compare free cash flow $35 million year-ago period. q3, incur capital expenditure purchase ipv4 address previously expected, start making purchase november still expect total outlay $20 million $25 million fiscal year previously communicated. like turn outlook fourth quarter full fiscal year 2025. fourth quarter, expect revenue range $515 million $519 million. expect non-gaap income operation range $55 million $58 million non-gaap net income per share range $0.62 $0.65 based 84.9 million estimated diluted weighted-average share outstanding. full-fiscal year 2025, expect revenue range $1.973 billion $1.977 billion, non-gaap income operation range $242 million $245 million, non-gaap net income per share range $3.01 $3.03 based 84 million estimated diluted weighted-average share outstanding. note non-gaap net income per share guidance fourth-quarter full-fiscal year 2025 includes non-gaap tax provision approximately 20%. provide context around updated guidance. first, term atlas consumption, expect see typical seasonal slowdown q4, driven underlying application usage moderating holiday season. second, since atlas consumption remained lower year-over-year basis q3, expect see continued deceleration atlas year-over-year growth q4. third, expect see sequential decline non-atlas revenue q4, contrary normal pattern. reason experienced significant additional benefit multi-year deal q3, expect recur q4. addition, want provide incremental color recent product -- recent product go-to-market change impact growth reported customer count going forward. first, dev explained, reallocating portion go-to-market resource mid-market enterprise channel. result, expect see significantly fewer mid-market direct sale customer net addition result, slower direct sale customer growth going forward. believe reallocation investment dollar drive higher revenue growth time. so, trade-off make sense. second, introduce atlas flex cluster q4 automatically migrate customer q1, expect see one-time negative impact customer count since approximately 4,000 serverless customer low spending expect transition flex. customer negligible impact revenue impact reported customer count. summarize, pleased third quarter result especially ability win new business. small share one largest fastest-growing market software number secular tailwinds, including ai back. continue investing judiciously focusing execution capture long-term opportunity. that, like open questions. operator? question & answers: operator [operator instructions] first question day coming sanjit singh morgan stanley. line open. sanjit singh -- analyst thank taking question congrats, michael, outstanding career. absolutely fantastic run mongodb. excited see next, excited take breather. congrats, michael. guess take question -- start questions, look atlas past two quarters, correct wrong, think consumption coming least modestly ahead expectations. relative seen beginning year, sort -- function sale execution? function end-user activity sort improving? what's driving least improvement atlas consumption past two quarters? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. different things. think look outlook beginning year, indicated thought would see stable atlas growth consumption standpoint. seen talked -- actually seen lower year-over-year growth based underlying consumption. -- that's incorporated q4 guide. seen q3 q4 -- sorry, q2 q3, excuse me, better expectations, still year-over-year basis. want make sure sort confusing comparative set year-over-year versus relative expectations. sanjit singh -- analyst understood. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer core it, sanjit, question really underlying usage applications. sanjit singh -- analyst yeah, make total sense. then, dev, ask ai agent question. term ai agent needing context, going set tool take actions. mean mongodb operational data store customer start roll agentic applications? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. so, talk agents, think think agents, there's jobs, there's -- sorry, there's job, there's project there's task. right now, agent rolled really focused task like say something sierra company rolling agents. right, deemed deal able create rich complex data structures. important ai ai model look isolated data points, need understand relationships, hierarchies, pattern within data. need able essentially get real-time insights. example, chatbot someone querying, customer kind trying get update order placed five minute ago may gotten confirmation, chatbot need able deal real-time information. need able deal basically handling advanced use cases, understanding like, thing like fraud detection understand behavior supply chains, need understand intricate data relationships. thing consistent mongodb offers. believe end day, well-positioned handle this. thing would say embedded natural way search vector search. oltp database, tech search vector search. that's one experience platform offer that, think real advantage. integrated leading ai framework platforms. enterprise-grade security compliance, customer run u anywhere, either 118 cloud region on-prem, huge differentiator us. sanjit singh -- analyst awesome. appreciate thoughts, dev. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, sanjit. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line taylor -- tyler radke citi. line open. tyler radke -- analyst hi, thank much taking question. and, michael, best, congratulation 10 years. going back sale execution, mean, one thing talked earlier year challenge term recently acquired workload ramping. think lot past fiscal year. curious quality workload acquisition trended year. think ramp consumption potential next year, sort look versus time year ago? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. maybe talk change made michael talk little bit consumption trends. so, make change beginning year, really wanted focus volume quality workload slight adjustment made. think change reasonable positive impact. again, early declare victory workload usually start small grow time, really pleased result seeing far. -- again, early days. obviously, know fiscal '25 workload go fiscal '26. far, good. michael, consumption? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, couple things, thanks, tyler. fiscal '24 cohort called earlier, slower growth continue. line revised expectations. made change talked -- earlier year affect fiscal '25 cohorts, early tell. those, need quarter data really see -- seeing behave differently. say talked new business environment success new business. pleased that, show kind initial piece, need see grow cohort evolve. tyler radke -- analyst great. thanks. follow-up ea side, talked outsized strength non-atlas business quarter. maybe could unpack like relative upside driven simply duration versus new business. know called duration impact year-over-year, -- feel like sort one-off feel like maybe bigger customer indexing toward ea impact way think product introducing thing like vector search stream processing onto on-prem product? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah, thank you. overall, continue find ea product resonate customers. important part run anywhere strategy continued see success people wanting increase investment mongodb. there's always multiyear component continue see that. talked beginning year fiscal '24 abnormally high amount multi-year benefit therefore, anticipating headwind quantified roughly $40 million range. talked call earlier saw large accounts, surprising amount multiyear positively benefited q3 little $15 million revenue compared saw q3 year ago. so, much headwind expecting. obviously, 606 dynamics, things, especially large deal kind meaty chunky lumpy, try call sort help people understand, there's pretty healthy kind baseline flow, ea, also multiyear. see spikes, try call you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. want add, tyler, investing call ea business. first, starting investing search vector search community product. couple thing us. one, whenever anyone start mongodb open-source product, immediately get benefit complete highly integrated platform. two, capability migrate ea. so, ea u investment strategy. definitely see lot large customer very, committed running workload on-prem. even see customer want run run ai workload on-prem. so, optionality get using mongodb on-prem cloud, also cross-cloud compelling one. tyler radke -- analyst thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line brad reback stifel. line open. brad reback -- analyst great. thanks much. and, michael, best luck. great run. dev, started call talking bunch investments, great given growth business. obviously, talked reallocating expenses. net-net, think incremental investment phase next year gating margin upside? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer think that's something obviously ready talk next year now, would say -- reason looking invest summarize again, going up-market legacy app modernization see large workload potentially play ideal database genai apps, future important investment drive long-term growth. quite energized investment that's something high conviction on. brad reback -- analyst that's great. maap program, workload going wind atlas healthy combination ea atlas? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer think early days. would say -- would probably say side atlas ea early days. think introduce search vector search ea product, see on-prem. obviously, people use mongodb ai workload using technology well conjunction mongodb on-prem ai use cases. would say probably going see happen first atlas. brad reback -- analyst great. thanks much. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line jason ader william blair. line open. jason ader -- analyst yeah, thank you. going belabor congratulating michael, fun working best luck. question strength ea. think, dev, represents comment enterprise might rethinking reassessing kind on-prem versus cloud workload placement decision? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer well, think large enterprises, think large enterprise meaningful workload still running on-prem. think belief everything would go cloud probably something really popular good old day zurp. think customer assess investment already place, much judicious run workload think leverage existing investment infrastructure, going so. also bunch reason like regulatory reasons, customer quite moving aggressively cloud. see particularly europe, see lot european bank still running majority workload on-prem. also varies region conversely asia, seeing people much move much aggressively cloud. think really depends industry, geography, personal dynamic what's happening particular account. mean, see large u bank also committed running thing on-prem. really varies. that's feel really good run anywhere strategy give customer optionality. build something run on-prem. choose move cloud, easy mongodb. jason ader -- analyst right. follow-up also investment making strategic sale enterprise. could get little specific investment might be? hiring lot new salespeople? working sis, investing sis? additional detail would helpful. thanks. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. everyone's benefit, identified number accounts, call strategic accounts, think high upside us. seen number account grow quickly deploy right mix resources. necessarily quota-carrying resources. could additional technical sale resources, additional p resources, additional customer service resource better service support accounts. even thing like run education session developer accounts, called either hackathons like call developer day even design review meet development team looking build application, help think would potentially use mongodb build particular app. find many developers, experience mongodb quite limited, engage them, educate show simple easy is. like example, customer today think like use oltp database, search database, maybe vector database, like caching database. integrated mongodb. sudden, customer say, wow, simplify life, simplify back-end infrastructure, build app far quickly much easier manage long-term everything mongodb. really function educating power mongodb really open lot opportunity us. that's doubling down, mix resource really predicated accounts, quota counting resources, whole suite resource bringing table. jason ader -- analyst thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line andrew nowinski well fargo. line open. andrew nowinski -- analyst okay. good afternoon. thank much taking question congrats nice quarter. gave example customer migrated postgres think said issue pg vector function. wondering long customer using postgres decided make change mongo, meaning sort like rebound type customer chose pg -- excuse me, postgres work? frequently seeing type transition? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. can't give specific long using postgres, -- trend seeing business. remember postgres 40-year-old technology. -- beneficiary people lifting shifting type relational databases, oracle, sql server, mysql, et cetera. open-source database. part -- open-source relational database, inherent challenge relational database do. quite inflexible. build schema, hard change schema. hard scale hard distribute data. large data volumes, weird thing like, example, resort off-road storage large data objects, creates performance bottlenecks. again, people default postgres know anything better know relational everyone kind moving relational platforms. that's whole point saying earlier. educate developer flexibility schema, easily horizontally scale rich query language aggregation sophisticated geospatial indexes, productivity gain using document model easy organize data, -- people like, wow, life much easier. want clear, zero-sum game. postgres fail u successful. big market quite excited opportunity, see customer moving postgres coming mongodb. andrew nowinski -- analyst thank you. helpful. maybe quick follow-up. normalize $15 million multiyear deal impact q3, would ea still sequentially q4? thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer given level guidance, trying help understand context full-year number headwind talked beginning year, given strength saw q3. andrew nowinski -- analyst got it. thanks. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line raimo lenschow barclays. line open. raimo lenschow -- analyst hey, thank you. think ea strength quarter, michael, kind give u little bit there. like think renewal -- renewal situation renewal pool coming like q3, coming q4, et cetera, well like mean term upsell, cross-sell opportunity people think starting ai project self-serve, kind mentioned earlier call? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. think -- think ea q4, tends large renewal quarter, talking term guide strength multiyear, that's would expect see ea sequentially, typically pattern, called out. term ai workload things, think early tell obviously, continue evolve assess view get full-year guide march. also updated view cohort behaving sort multiyear played out. think term q4, comment made earlier hopefully help. raimo lenschow -- analyst yeah. okay, perfect. -- talk little bit like obviously, there's debate like database persistent layer ai projects, et cetera. see big hyperscalers term working guy partnerships? obviously aws kind summit, et-cetera. speak little bit like relationship big guy evolving around this? michael, best case talk you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. so, start partnership first, like -- aws, said, re:invent show last week. -- remains very, strong. closed ton deal past quarter. very, large deals. integration new product like q bedrock engagement field really strong. azure, think -- shared past, start-off little bit slow start, word person run partner leadership, azure mongodb relationship never stronger. closed large number deals. part what's called azure native ic service program bunch deep integration azure, including fabric, power bi, visual studio, semantic kernel, azure openai studio. also one azure's largest marketplace partners. gcp -- actually seen uptick term co-sales done past quarter gcp made comp change -- favorable working mongodb saw result field, focused closing -- closing handful large deal gcp q4. general, would say, thing going quite well. term of, guess, implying question like hyperscalers potentially bundling thing along ai offerings? mean, candidly, since day one, hyperscalers bundling database offering every offering that's predominant strategy. -- think executed well strategy database like by-the-way decision. important decision. think hyperscalers seeing performance realize better partner us. said, customer understand importance data layer, especially ai applications. partnership across three hyperscalers strong. raimo lenschow -- analyst ok, perfect. thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer thanks, raimo. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line brad sill bank america. line open. brad sill -- analyst great. thank much, congratulations, michael, next move. wanted ask new workload vector search, stream processing, relational migrator. one three that's ramping faster maybe expected? little bit color new workload type ramping. thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. kind give rundown -- mean, essentially asking new products, like -- search, introduced new capability called atlas search nodes, asymmetrically scale search node search-intensive use case, scale node become quite expensive. seen kind groundbreaking capability really well received. demand quite high customer like tune configuration unique need search requirements. one world's largest bank using atlas search provide like google-like search experience payment data massive corporate customers. customer-facing application performance, scalability critical. leading provider ai-powered accounting software us atlas search power invoice analytics future, allows end user finance team perform ad-hoc analysis easily find past-due invoice voice contain errors. search -- vector search, -- again, kind first full-year since going generally available. product uptake actually very, high. q3, released quantization atlas vector search, reduces memory requirement 96%, allowing u support larger vector workload vastly improved price performance. example, multinational news organization created genai powered tool designed help producer journalist efficiently search, summarize, verify information vast varied data sources. leading security firm using atlas vector search fight ai fraud leading global medium company replaced elastic search hybrid search vector search use case user recommendation engine that's built suggest -- that's built suggest article end users. that's super exciting see well. also seeing lot interest streaming product, demand high. rolled another hyperscaler, customer commenting use case able embed stream processing mongodb make life much easier. overall, quite pleased progress making new products. said before, natively bundling capability really reduces eliminates need customer bolt bunch different technology solve problem, saving lot time, money, cost, risk. brad sill -- analyst that's really exciting. thanks, dev. wanted ask question around cedric's appointment. focus may different leadership thinking going forward? thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer no, cedric cro for, gosh, like think like five, six years, -- interim cro three quarter took last made change really expansion responsibilities. known cedric long time. worked multiple different companies. think good barometer understanding sale leadership. there's number sale leader worked top-tier software company used work me. super-excited role cedric going take also making change cedric better align different organization tightly work together going up-market, app monetization positioning well ideal database genai apps. brad sill -- analyst super exciting. thanks, dev. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer thanks, brad. operator thank you. one moment next question, please. next question coming line mike cikos needham company. line open. mike cikos -- analyst hey guys, thanks taking question here. wanted come back consumption growth slightly better expectation second quarter row now. apology missed it, improvement seeing, across vintage geography potentially concentrated scope? trying get better understanding what's seeking place what's embedded guide. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. no, would describe broad-based, mike. obviously, pleased see continuing monitoring slicing dicing different ways. information insight you, share it. without trying throw whole bunch cold water mind, slightly better, step-function changed better, good see. mike cikos -- analyst terrific. maybe quick follow-up dev. think build maybe tyler's question top q&a, cited customer thinking workload holistically even looking run ai workload on-prem. much think function customer still trying figure optimize latency cost demonstration really early phase exploratory phase versus going production? way coarse two necessarily connected? thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer no, think kind little bit both. think customer committed running big part estate on-prem. definition, going build ai workload, run on-prem, mean also need access gpus that. customer leveraging basically renting gpus cloud provider building ai workloads. think very, early days. still learning, experimenting. more-and-more apps entering production. said prepared remarks, thousand workload -- ai workload running mongodb, small percentage demonstrated meaningful product market fit. initial traction kind still small. think people get sophisticated ai, ai technology matures becomes useful, think application -- start seeing application take-off. kind chuckled today see senior leader bragging chip using versus apps building. tell still very, early day big platform shift. mike cikos -- analyst great point. thank again, guys. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, mike. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line eric heath keybanc. line open. eric heath -- analyst hi, thanks taking question. dev, michael, sound like takeaway call greater focus ea enterprise. structurally rethink ea business differently think healthy double-digit growth business going forward foreseeable future? could ask follow-up question separate that. michael, understand still early identify fiscal '25 cohort workloads, curious high-level look feel like higher quality fiscal '24 cohort workflow. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer want take first one term ea... michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, mean, would say, mean, committed run anywhere strategy. said, first investing community many customer first way experience mongodb. want full experience integrating search vector search core product. gate really start building applications. transition building capability ea. so, clearly investing ea product. atlas still big, big part business big, big part growth engine typically launch new feature atlas capability already have, fact multi-cloud make very, compelling offering many customers. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. think term workloads, think early. reminder folks, tend start small, although grow quickly. think thing add is, pretty consistent pleased new business done. need time let cohort play track them. think like said, happy new business winning. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line william power baird. line open. brian raferty denyeau -- investor relation there, william? william power -- analyst sorry, yeah. thank you. dev, encouraging comment relational migrator. wonder could touch think driving higher interest here. mean, sound like ai contributing helping, great get color still feel like obviously meaningful long-term opportunity. maybe second part question dev michael, great get framework around professional service investments. way kind think quantification timing that? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. reason excited opportunity go legacy application that, one, seems like there's confluence event happening. one increasing cost tax supporting managing legacy apps going enough. second, many customer regulated industries, regulator calling -- fact running legacy apps systemic risk, longer kick road. third, also longer kick around, vendor going end-of-life, make decision migrate application modern tech stack. fourth, genai predicated data build competitive advantage, need leverage proprietary data, people want access data able easily. that's another reason want modernize. also people built application retiring longer firm, creates risk companies. given that, customer incredibly interested figuring way easily safely securely migrate -- applications. always could help easily move data map schema relational schema document schema. hardest part essentially rewriting application. advent genai, significantly reduce time. one, use genai analyze existing code. two, use genai reverse engineer test test code does. three, use genai build new code user test ensure new code produce result old code. time effort suddenly cut meaningful way that's suddenly creating lot interest customer saying, goodness. already relational app, moving another relational app feel like modernization. so, advantage moving mongodb give much modern platform, much agile, flexible, performant, scalable platform future needs. that's excited. again, early days. run number pilot gone well. process working customer migration process. take time very, complex applications. actually, one thing also mentioned going -- saying go tertiary tier 2 tier 3 application, saying, hey, want look crown jewel apps painful us. that's also exciting. again, take time, committed this, think going drive -- help u drive long-term -- meaningful long-term growth. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, will. last part question professional service investment, really building capacity order meet demand seeing relative opportunity. calling particular gross margin impact that's typically show up. maybe last thing probably obvious, sort underscore reason though arr, right, drive new workloads, additional workload mongodb part migration. time, talked before, hope expect able leverage technology more, least initially medium-term, there's going healthy human/services component that. wanted sort effectively telegraph folks. william power -- analyst that's helpful. thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, will. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line rudy kessinger da davidson. please go ahead. rudy kessinger -- analyst hey guys, thanks squeezing here. believe last quarter said consumption growth slightly ahead expectations. slower year-over-year growth versus q2 last year, year-over-year growth improve q1. so, guess curious q3, could make comment regard? obviously, slower year-over-year basis q3 last year, stable year-over-year consumption growth q2 better worse? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. rudy, thanks question. specifically called relative q2. see lower year-over-year growth called out. see seasonal rebound. usually q3 stronger q2 talked smaller prior year. hopefully, help triangulate. rudy kessinger -- analyst okay. quick follow-up. believe q4 call back march. point, dev, said would least another year ai application deployed scale. sound like commentary early large workloads, thousands, many large scale. guess, expectation maybe still least another year seeing broad ai application rollouts scale? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. think lot function what's happening r&d side ai, right? example, today, compelling model designed phones, right, today phone computing horsepower run complex models. so, see ton very, successful consumer apps besides, say, chatgpt claude. -- also see like hundred apps taking like saw kind first generation like internet cloud era, right, mobile era. like think still early day ai. see lot people building ai apps, lot kind fairly rudimentary functionality. think time that's going change. fact, know change. can't predict happen. see apps production, traction, seeing grow very, quickly lot platform. really meaningful. operator thank you. concludes today's q&a session. would like go ahead turn call back dev closing remarks. please go ahead. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thank you, everyone. wanted say really pleased q3 result strong new business performance revenue exceeding expectation -- across atlas ea. making necessary investment expand enterprise channel see largest opportunity establish mongodb standard strongest return go-to-market investments. looking ahead, encouraged progress making accelerating legacy app modernization ai well establishing standard emerging ai tech stack greenfield ai applications. last least, would like thank michael contribution past 10 year wish well. thank you, everyone, talk soon. operator [operator

         "MongoDB ( MDB 1.96% ) Q3 2025 Earnings Call Dec 09, 2024 , 5:00 p.m. ET Contents: Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants Prepared Remarks: Operator Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MongoDB third-quarter fiscal year 2025 conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there'll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your speaker for today, Brian Denyeau. Please go ahead. Brian Raferty Denyeau -- Investor Relations Thank you, Lisa. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today to review MongoDB's third-quarter fiscal 2025 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued after the close of the market today. Joining me the call today are Dev Ittycheria, president and CEO of MongoDB; and Michael Gordon, MongoDB's COO and CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our market and future growth opportunities, our expectations for the macroeconomic environment in fiscal 2025 and the impact of AI, the benefits of our product platform, our competitive landscape, customer behaviors, our financial guidance, and our planned investments in growth opportunities in AI. These statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including the results of operations and financial condition that cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. For a discussion of the material risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please refer to the risks described in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 31st, 2024 that we filed with the SEC on August 30th, 2024. Any forward-looking statements made on this call reflect our views only as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them except as required by law. Additionally, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures on this conference call. Please refer to the tables in our earnings release in the Investor Relations portion of our website for a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dev. Dev? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we had a strong quarter of new business and executed well against our large market opportunity. Let's begin by reviewing our third quarter results before giving you a broader company update. We generated revenue of $529 million, a 22% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew 26% year-over-year, representing 68% of total revenue. We generated non-GAAP operating income of $101 million for a 19% non-GAAP operating margin and we ended the quarter with over 52,600 customers. Overall, we were pleased with our performance in the third quarter. We had a strong new business quarter and we're happy with our new workload acquisition on Atlas. Our non-Atlas business significantly exceeded expectations in part because we benefited from a few large multi-year deals as customers continue to value our run anywhere strategy and want to build a deeper longer-term relationship with MongoDB. Atlas consumption was slightly better than expected in a macro-environment that we would characterize as largely consistent with what we saw in the first half of the year. Michael will cover consumption trends in more detail. Retention rates remained strong in Q3, demonstrating the mission criticality of our platform. On our Q1 earnings call, we shared with you the three major strategic initiatives that we believe will enable us to maximize our long-term opportunity. I want to give you an update on the progress we're making on those initiatives. First, we are increasing our investment in the enterprise channel since we see the strongest returns in this part of the market. Specifically, we're expanding our strategic account program going to next year, as we see more accounts that will benefit from incremental investment. In addition, we're investing time and resources to educate developers in large enterprise accounts and uplevel their MongoDB skills. These organizations have thousands of developers and as we penetrate them more deeply, we encounter developers who have historically only built SQL applications and simply do not know how to use MongoDB to its full potential. In our experience, educating these developers on the benefits of MongoDB drives significant incremental adoption of our platform. To fund these up-market investments, we are reallocating a portion of our mid-market investments. The mid-market remains an attractive opportunity for us, but we believe that prioritizing investment up-market will deliver strong returns in the current environment. We also believe there are additional ways to serve the mid-market more efficiently through our self-serve channel and other scaled technology-enabled sales and customer service motions. Second, we are optimistic about the opportunity to accelerate legacy app modernization using AI and are investing more in this area. As you recall, we ran a few successful pilots earlier this year, demonstrating that AI tooling combined with professional services and our relational migrator product can significantly reduce the time, cost, and risk of migrating legacy applications onto MongoDB. While it's early days, we have observed a more than 50% reduction in the cost to modernize. On the back of these strong early results, additional customer interest is exceeding our expectations. Large enterprises in every industry and geography are experiencing acute pain from their legacy infrastructure and are eager for more agile, performant, and cost-effective solutions. Not only are customers excited to engage with us, they also want to focus on some of the most important applications in their enterprise, further demonstrating the level of interest and size of the long-term opportunity. As relational applications encompass a wide variety of database types, programming languages, versions, and other customer-specific variables, we expect modernization projects to continue to include meaningful service engagements in the short and medium term. Consequently, we're increasing our professional services delivery capabilities, both directly and through partners. In the long run, we expect to automate and simplify large parts of the modernization process. To that end, we are leveraging the learnings from early service engagement to develop new tools to accelerate future modernization efforts. Although it's early days and scaling our legacy app modernization capabilities will take time, we have increased conviction that this motion will significantly add to our growth in the long term. Third, we are investing to capitalize on our inherent technical advantages as a key component of the emerging AI tech stack. As a reminder, MongoDB is uniquely equipped to query rich and complex data structures typical of AI applications. The ability of a database to query rich and complex data structures is crucial because AI applications often rely on highly detailed, interrelated, and nuanced data to make accurate predictions and decisions. For example, a recommendation system doesn't just analyze a single customer's purchase but also considers their browsing history, peer group behavior, and product categories requiring a database that can query and interlink these complex data structures. In addition, MongoDB's architecture unifies source data, metadata, operational data, and vector data in an all-in-one platform, updating the need for multiple database systems and complex back-end architectures. This enables a more compelling developer experience than any other alternative. From what we see in the AI market today, most customers are still in the experimental stage as they work to understand the effectiveness of the underlying tech stack and build early proof-of-concept applications. However, we are seeing an increasing number of AI apps in production. Today, we have thousands of AI apps on our platform. What we don't yet see is many of these apps actually achieving meaningful product market fit and therefore significant traction. In fact, as you take a step back and look at the entire universe of AI apps, a very small percentage of them have achieved the type of scale that we commonly see with enterprise-specific applications. We do have some AI apps that are growing quickly, including one that is already a seven-figure workload that has grown 10 times since the beginning of the year. Similar to prior platform shifts as the usefulness of AI tech improves and becomes more cost-effective, we will see the emergence of many more AI apps that do nail product market fit, but it's difficult to predict when that will happen more broadly. We remain confident that we will capture our fair share of these successful AI applications as we see that our platform is popular with developers building more sophisticated AI use cases. We continue investing in our product capabilities, including enterprise-grade Atlas Vector Search functionality to build on this momentum and even better position MongoDB to capture the AI opportunity. In addition, as previously announced, we are bringing search and vector service to our community and EA offerings, leveraging our run anywhere competitive advantage in the world of AI. Finally, we are expanding our MongoDB AI applications program or MAAP, which helps enterprise customers build and bring AI applications into production by providing them with reference architectures, integrations with leading tech providers, and coordinated services and support. Last week, we announced a new code of partners including McKinsey, Confluent, Capgemini, and Unstructured, as well as the collaboration with Meta to enable developers to build AI-enriched applications on MongoDB using Llama. Next, I'd like to provide you with a brief product update. At our dot local developer conference in London in October, we announced the general availability of MongoDB 8.0, the fastest and most performant version of MongoDB ever. MongoDB 8.0 performs 20% to 60% better against common industry benchmarks compared to our prior version and is built to exceed our customers' most stringent security, resiliency, availability, and performance requirements. To best serve our customers, we regularly review and reprioritize investments in our product portfolio to ensure we're allocating our resources to products with the highest demand from our customers. And to do that, we also deprecate products that are not showing results we desired. Consequently, we made the decision to consolidate our Atlas serverless offerings with our smallest dedicated tiers to create Atlas Flex customers, a new offering with a simpler architecture that provides the elasticity features akin to serverless. We will begin migrating effective customers to the single, simple, entry-level solution in Q4. We also decided to deprecate Atlas DeviceSync and other capabilities not widely adopted in order to focus our engineering resources on the core platform. While these reprioritization decisions are not made lightly, they allow us to deliver the most value to the largest number of customers, reinforcing our commitment to being the best modern database and helping us to grow faster. Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the adoption trends of MongoDB across our customer base. Customers across industries and around the world are running mission-critical projects in MongoDB Atlas, leveraging the full power of our developer data platform, including Financial Times, CarGurus, and Victoria's Secret. As part of the digital transformation journey, global specialty retailer Victoria's Secret & Company migrated its e-commerce platform to MongoDB Atlas. As a fully managed platform, MongoDB Atlas allowed the company to simplify its architecture and improve performance, supporting the retailer to provide a resilient, secure, and fast web and mobile e-commerce experience for their millions of customers around the world. Allianz, Alphamad, Swiss Post, and Paylocity are turning to MongoDB to modernize applications. Paylocity, a leading provider of cloud-based payroll and human capital management software, selected MongoDB to power proprietary application aimed at fostering employee connections and engagement. When traffic increased and the original SQL-based solution was unable to keep up with the required performance metrics, Paylocity migrated to MongoDB Atlas to take advantage of the flexible schema architecture, performance, and scalability. MongoDB costs five times less than the previous SQL database solution and the company's developers can now create an application within minutes, something that used to take weeks. Mature companies and start-ups alike are using MongoDB to help deliver the next wave of AI-powered application to customers, including NerdWallet, Cisco, and Tealbook. Tealbook, a supplier intelligence platform, migrated from Postgres, pgvector, and ElasticSearch to MongoDB to eliminate technical debt and consolidate their tech stack. The company experienced workload isolation and scalability issues in pgvector and were concerned with the search index inconsistencies, which were all resolved with the migration to MongoDB. With Atlas Vector search and dedicated search nodes, Tealbook has realized improved cost-efficiency and increased scalability for the supplier data platform, an application that uses GenAI to collect, verify, and enrich supplier data across various sources. In summary, we had a healthy Q3 with both Atlas and EA exceeding expectations. We saw a strong new business quarter and we remain confident in our ability to become an increasing strategic provider in our large and growing market. Looking forward, we see a great opportunity to grow our adoption in the enterprise through new workloads, modernizing legacy applications, and winning the next generation of AI-powered applications. I would like to finish by providing an update on our senior leadership. First, as we announced early in the press release, after nearly 10 years, Michael Gordon has made the decision to leave MongoDB. Michael has been instrumental in MongoDB's success over the past decade, leading our successful IPO, helping us grow our revenue nearly 50-fold, and scaling -- and successfully scaling our business model to generate meaningful operating leverage. He has been a trusted advisor and business partner to the Board and me over the years and also has become a personal friend. Michael is excited to take a well-deserved break. We have commenced the search for Michael's replacement and will be evaluating both internal and external candidates. One of Michael's proudest compliments -- accomplishments has been building a world-class finance team under his leadership, and I'm confident that we will not miss a beat during this transition. Michael will continue to serve as CFO through January 31st to help us finish the fiscal year and then will transition to an Advisor to the company to ensure a seamless process. If we have not named Michael's successor by fiscal year-end, Serge Tanjga, SVP of Finance, will serve as Interim CFO, beginning on February 1st. Second, we are promoting Cedric Pech, currently our chief revenue officer to the newly created role of president worldwide field operations. In this new position, Cedric will oversee all our field-based customer-facing and go-to-market enablement teams, including professional services. We believe this org structure will best enable us to execute on some of the key strategic initiatives I discussed earlier, in particular, our increased focus on up-market and the app monetization opportunity. I would like to congratulate Cedric on this well-deserved promotion. With that, let me turn the call over to Michael. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Dev, and thanks for the kind words and our incredible partnership over the past decade. The past 10 years have been the most rewarding in my professional career and I'm extremely proud of what we've achieved together and of course, to the whole MongoDB team. With as much success as we had, I still believe that MongoDB is in the early stages of realizing its full potential as it continues to take share in one of the largest markets in software. Now, turning to the results for the quarter. I'll begin with a detailed review of our third-quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025. First, I'll start with our third quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $529.4 million, up 22% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance. Shifting to our product mix, Atlas grew 26% in the quarter compared to the previous year and now represents 68% of total revenue compared to 66% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and 71% last quarter. We recognized Atlas revenue primarily based on customer consumption of our platform and that consumption is closely tied to end user activity of their applications. Let me provide some context on Atlas consumption in the quarter. In Q3, consumption was slightly ahead of our expectations. This year's Q3 seasonal improvement was more muted than in years past as expected. On a year-over-year basis, consumption growth remains below that of prior year period. Turning to non-Atlas revenue. Non-Atlas came in significantly ahead of our expectations. As Dev mentioned, EA new business was strong, and we continue to have success selling incremental workloads into our existing customer base. In addition, our Q3 non-Atlas revenue benefited from a few large multi-year deals. As you know, due to ASC 606, we recognized the entire term license component of a multi-year contract at the start of that contract. Compared to Q3 of last year, the multi-year license component of non-Atlas revenues was over $15 million higher. Turning to customer growth. During the third quarter, we grew our customer base by approximately 1,900 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 52,600, which is up from over 46,400 in the year-ago period. Of our total customer count, over 7,400 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 6,900 in the year-ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven primarily by Atlas, which had over 51,100 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 44,900 in the year-ago period. It is important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers adding their first Atlas workload. Continuing on, in Q3, our net ARR expansion rate was approximately 120%. We ended the quarter with 2,314 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, up from $1,972 in the year-ago period. Moving down the income statement, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the third quarter was $405.7 million, representing a gross margin of 77%, which is flat versus the year-ago period. Our income from operations was $101.5 million or 19% operating margin for the third quarter compared to an 18% operating margin in the year-ago period. The primary reason for more favorable operating income results versus guidance is our revenue outperformance, including the very high margin multi-year license revenue benefit. Net income in the third quarter was $98.1 million or $1.16 per share, based on 84.2 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a net income of $79.1 million or $0.96 per share on 83.7 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding in the year-ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the third quarter with $2.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $37.4 million. After taking into consideration approximately $2.9 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was $34.6 million in the quarter. This compares to free cash flow of $35 million in the year-ago period. In Q3, we did not incur capital expenditures to purchase IPV4 addresses as we previously expected, but we did start making those purchases in November and still expect a total outlay of $20 million to $25 million this fiscal year as we previously communicated. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $515 million to $519 million. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $55 million to $58 million and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.65 based on 84.9 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. For the full-fiscal year 2025, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.973 billion to $1.977 billion, non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $242 million to $245 million, and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $3.01 to $3.03 based on 84 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. Note that the non-GAAP net income per share guidance for the fourth-quarter and full-fiscal year 2025 includes a non-GAAP tax provision of approximately 20%. I'll now provide some more context around our updated guidance. First, in terms of Atlas consumption, we expect to see a typical seasonal slowdown in Q4, driven by underlying application usage moderating during the holiday season. Second, since Atlas consumption remained lower on a year-over-year basis in Q3, we expect to see continued deceleration of Atlas year-over-year growth in Q4. Third, we expect to see a sequential decline in non-Atlas revenue in Q4, which is contrary to our normal pattern. The reason for this is that we experienced a significant additional benefit from multi-year deals in Q3, which we do not expect to recur in Q4. In addition, I want to provide some incremental color on some of our recent product and -- how some of our recent product and go-to-market changes will impact the growth of our reported customer count going forward. First, as Dev explained, we are reallocating a portion of our go-to-market resources from the mid-market to the enterprise channel. As a result, we expect to see significantly fewer mid-market direct sales customer net additions and as a result, slower direct sales customer growth going forward. We believe this reallocation of investment dollars will drive higher revenue growth over time. So, it's a trade-off that makes sense. Second, as we introduce Atlas Flex clusters in Q4 and automatically migrate customers in Q1, we expect to see a one-time negative impact to our customer count since we have approximately 4,000 serverless customers who are very low spending and we do not expect them to transition over to Flex. These customers have a negligible impact on our revenue but will impact our reported customer count. To summarize, we're pleased with our third quarter results and especially our ability to win new business. We have a small share in one of the largest and fastest-growing markets in all of software with a number of secular tailwinds, including AI at our back. We'll continue investing judiciously and focusing on our execution to capture this long-term opportunity. With that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator? Questions & Answers: Operator [Operator instructions] Our first question for the day will be coming from Sanjit Singh of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Thank you for taking the questions and congrats, Michael, on outstanding career. You had an absolutely fantastic run at MongoDB. I'm excited to see what you do next, or excited if you just take a breather. So congrats, Michael. I guess to take the question -- to start off with the questions, when we look at what Atlas has been doing in the past two quarters, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think consumption is coming in at least modestly ahead of your expectations. Relative to what we've seen at the beginning of the year, what sort of -- is it a function of sales execution? Is it a function of the end-user activity sort of improving? What's driving at least the improvement in Atlas consumption in the past two quarters? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So a few different things. So I think if you look at our outlook at the beginning of the year, we had indicated that we thought we would see stable Atlas growth from a consumption standpoint. What we've seen and what we've talked about is -- we've actually seen lower year-over-year growth based on the underlying consumption. And so -- and that's incorporated into our Q4 guide. We have seen the Q3 and Q4 be -- sorry, Q2 and Q3, excuse me, be better than our expectations, but it's still down on a year-over-year basis. And so I want to make sure that we're not sort of confusing the comparative set of year-over-year versus relative to our expectations. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Understood. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer And the core of it, Sanjit, to your question is really the underlying usage of the applications. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Yeah, that makes total sense. And then, Dev, I have to ask you the AI agent question. In terms of an AI agent needing more context, it has going to have a set of tools to take its actions. What does it mean for MongoDB as an operational data store as customers start to roll out more agentic applications? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, just to talk about agents, I think when you think about agents, there's jobs, there's -- sorry, there's a job, there's projects and then there's task. Right now, the agents that are being rolled out are really focused on task like say something from Sierra or some other companies are rolling out agents. But you're right, what they deemed to do is to deal with being able to create a rich and complex data structures. Now why is this important for AI is that AI models don't just look at isolated data points, but they need to understand relationships, hierarchies, and patterns within the data. They need to be able to essentially get real-time insights. For example, if you have a chatbot where someone is querying, a customer is kind of trying to get some update on the order they placed five minutes ago because they may have not gotten any confirmation, your chatbot needs to be able to deal with real-time information. You need to be able to deal with basically handling very advanced use cases, understanding like, to do things like fraud detection to understand behaviors of supply chains, you need to understand intricate data relationships. All these things are consistent with MongoDB offers. And so we believe that at the end of the day, we are well-positioned to handle this. And the other thing that I would say is that we've embedded in a very natural way of search and vector search. So we're just not an OLTP database, we do tech search and vector search. That's all one experience and no other platform offers that, and we think we have a real advantage. And so we're integrated with the leading AI frameworks and platforms. We have enterprise-grade security and compliance, and customers can run us anywhere, either on 118 cloud regions or on-prem, and that again is a huge differentiator for us. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Awesome. Appreciate the thoughts, Dev. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Sanjit. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Taylor -- Tyler Radke of Citi. Your line is open. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Hi, thank you very much for taking the question. And, Michael, all the best, and congratulations on 10 years. Going back to the sales execution, I mean, one of the things that you talked about earlier this year was some challenges just in terms of the recently acquired workloads ramping. And I think a lot of those were from the past fiscal year. So curious how the quality of workload acquisition has trended this year. And as you think about the ramp in consumption potential into next year, how does that sort of look versus this time a year ago? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Maybe I'll just talk about what we're doing and the changes we made and then Michael can talk a little bit about the consumption trends. So, we did make some changes at the beginning of the year, and we really wanted to focus on both the volume and the quality of the workloads and there were some slight adjustments that we made. We think those changes are having a reasonable positive impact. Again, it's too early to declare victory because these workloads usually start small and grow over time, but we're really pleased with the results we're seeing so far. And -- but again, it's early days. And obviously, we'll know about the fiscal '25 workloads as we go into fiscal '26. But so far, so good. Michael, on consumption? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, just a couple of things, and thanks, Tyler. The fiscal '24 cohorts that we called out earlier, that slower growth does continue. They've been in line with our revised expectations. We made some changes that we talked about at the -- earlier in the year that should affect the fiscal '25 cohorts, but it's just too early to tell. On those, we need a few more quarters of data before you can really see if we're -- how we're seeing those behave differently. I will say we've talked about the new business environment and our success in new business. We have been pleased with that, but that just shows kind of the initial piece, and we need to see how they grow and how those cohorts evolve. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Great. Thanks. And follow-up on the EA side, you talked about the outsized strength in non-Atlas business this quarter. Maybe if you could unpack like the relative upside that was driven by simply duration versus new business. I know you called out the duration impact year-over-year, but are -- do you feel like this was sort of a one-off or do you feel like maybe some of your bigger customers are indexing more toward EA and how does that impact the way you think about the product and introducing things like vector search and stream processing onto the on-prem product? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, thank you. So overall, we continue to find the EA product resonate with customers. It's an important part of the run anywhere strategy and we've continued to see success with that and people wanting to increase their investment in MongoDB. There's always been a multiyear component and we continue to see that. We talked about that at the beginning of the year as to how fiscal '24 had an abnormally high amount of multi-year benefit and therefore, we were anticipating that being a headwind and we quantified that in roughly the $40 million range. What we talked about on this call earlier is we saw from a few large accounts, a surprising amount of multiyear that positively benefited Q3 at a little more than $15 million in revenue compared to what we saw Q3 a year ago. So, not as much of a headwind as we had been expecting. Obviously, with the 606 dynamics, some of these things, especially for a large deal can be kind of meaty and chunky and lumpy, which is why we try and call it out and sort of help people understand, but there's a pretty healthy kind of baseline flow, not just of EA, but also of multiyear. And when we see spikes, we just try and call it out for you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I just want to add, Tyler, that we are investing in our what we call our EA business. First, we're starting by investing with search and vector search and a community product. That does a couple of things for us. One, whenever anyone starts with MongoDB with the open-source product, they immediately get all the benefits of that complete highly integrated platform. Two, those capabilities will then migrate to EA. So, EA for us is an investment strategy. We definitely see lots of large customers who are very, very committed to running workloads on-prem. We even see some customers want to run to run AI workloads on-prem. So, the optionality they get by using MongoDB to not just be on-prem and the cloud, but also cross-cloud is a very compelling one. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Brad Reback of Stifel. Your line is open. Brad Reback -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. And, Michael, best of luck. It's been a great run. Dev, you started the call talking about a bunch of investments, which are great given the growth of the business. And obviously, you talked about reallocating some expenses. But net-net, should we think about this incremental investment phase next year as gating margin upside? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think that's something that we obviously are not ready to talk about next year just now, but I would say that we -- the reason we're looking to invest and just to summarize again, going up-market on legacy app modernization where we see very large workloads potentially at play and being the ideal database for GenAI apps, which is the future as important investments to drive long-term growth. And we're quite energized by those investments and that's something that we have high conviction on. Brad Reback -- Analyst That's great. And then on the MAAP program, are most of those workloads going to wind up in Atlas or will that be a healthy combination of EA and Atlas? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think it's again early days. I would say -- I would probably say more on the side of Atlas and EA in the early days. I think once we introduce a search and vector search into the EA product, you'll see more of that on-prem. Obviously, people can use MongoDB for AI workloads using other technologies as well in conjunction with MongoDB for on-prem AI use cases. But I would say you're probably going to see that happen first in Atlas. Brad Reback -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Jason Ader of William Blair. Your line is open. Jason Ader -- Analyst Yeah, thank you. I'm not going to belabor congratulating Michael, but it has been it has been fun working with you and best of luck. The question I had is on the strength in EA. Do you think, Dev, it represents a comment on how enterprises might be rethinking or reassessing the kind of on-prem versus cloud workload placement decision? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Well, when I think about large enterprises, I think large enterprises have meaningful workloads that are still running on-prem. I think the belief that everything would go to the cloud was probably something that was really popular in the good old days of Zurp. But I think now as customers assess their investments that they already have in place, they're being much more judicious about where they run those workloads and if they think they can leverage their existing investments in their own infrastructure, then they're going to do so. Also for a bunch of other reasons like regulatory reasons, some customers are quite not moving as aggressively to the cloud. We see that in particularly in Europe, where we see a lot of the European banks still running majority of the workloads on-prem. So it also varies by region where conversely in Asia, we're seeing people much move much more aggressively to the cloud. So I think it really depends on industry, on geography, and on the personal dynamics of what's happening in that particular account. I mean, we see some large US banks are also very committed to running things on-prem. So it really varies. And that's why we feel really good about our run anywhere strategy because it gives customer optionality. They can build something and run on-prem. And if and when they choose to move to the cloud, it's very easy to do so with MongoDB. Jason Ader -- Analyst All right. And then just as a follow-up also on the investments you're making in strategic sales and enterprise. Could you just get a little more specific on what those investments might be? Is it hiring a lot of new salespeople? Is it working more with SIs, investing more in SIs? Any additional detail would be helpful. Thanks. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So just for everyone's benefit, we've identified a number of accounts, which we call strategic accounts, which we think that have high upside for us. We've seen a number of accounts that grow very quickly when we deploy the right mix of resources. Now they're all not necessarily quota-carrying resources. They could be additional technical sales resources, additional PS resources, additional customer service resources to better service and support those accounts. We even do things like run education sessions for developers of the accounts, they're called either hackathons or like what we call developer days or even design reviews where we'll meet with our development teams who are looking to build an application, help them think about how they would potentially use MongoDB to build that particular app. And what we find is that because many of these developers, the experience with MongoDB is quite limited, the more we can engage with them, the more we can educate them and the more we can show them how simple and easy it is. Like for example, most customers today think like they have to use an OLTP database, then a search database, maybe a vector database, and then like a caching database. And all that is integrated in MongoDB. So all of a sudden, customers can say, wow, I can simplify my life, simplify my back-end infrastructure, build this app far more quickly and it will be much more easier to manage long-term if I do everything on MongoDB. And it's really a function of just educating them on the power of MongoDB that really opens up a lot of opportunities for us. So that's why we're doubling down, and the mix of resources is really predicated on the accounts, but it's not just quota counting resources, it's the whole suite of resources that we're bringing to the table. Jason Ader -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Andrew Nowinski of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Okay. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking the question and congrats on a nice quarter. You gave an example of a customer that migrated off Postgres and I think you said they had issues with their PG vector function. I was wondering how long was that customer using Postgres before they decided to make a change to Mongo, meaning was this some sort of like a rebound type customer where they chose PG -- or excuse me, Postgres and it didn't work? And then how frequently are you seeing this type of transition? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So I can't give you the specifics on how long they were using Postgres, but this is not -- this is a trend that we're seeing in our business. You have to remember Postgres is a 40-year-old technology. It's -- and they have been the beneficiary of people lifting and shifting from other types of relational databases, Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, et cetera. And they're an open-source database. And but as part -- because they're an open-source and relational database, they have the same inherent challenges all relational databases do. They're quite inflexible. So once you build a schema, it's very hard to change the schema. It's hard to scale and hard to distribute data. And if you have large data volumes, you have to do weird things like, for example, resort to off-road storage for large data objects, which creates performance bottlenecks. And so again, people default to Postgres if they don't know anything better because all they know is relational and everyone is kind of moving off those other relational platforms. And that's the whole point I was saying earlier. Once we educate developers on the flexibility of schema, how easily or horizontally scale the rich query language where you can do aggregations and do sophisticated geospatial indexes, the productivity gains by using the document model and how easy is to organize data, it's -- people are just like, wow, life is so much easier. Now I want to be clear, this is not a zero-sum game. Postgres does not have to fail for us to be successful. It's a big market and we're quite excited about the opportunity, but we do see customers moving off Postgres and coming to MongoDB. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Thank you. That was very helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up. If we normalize the $15 million multiyear deal impact you had in Q3, would EA still be down sequentially in Q4? Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer We haven't given that level of guidance, but just trying to help you understand in the context of the full-year numbers and the headwind that we talked about at the beginning of the year, just given the strength that we saw in Q3. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Got it. Thanks. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. The next question will be coming from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst Hey, thank you. And if you think about the EA strength this quarter, Michael, you'd kind of give us a little bit there. Like how should we think about renewal -- the renewal situation renewal pool coming up like or that you had in Q3, coming up in Q4, et cetera, as well and then like what does it mean in terms of upsell, cross-sell opportunity as people think about starting AI projects by self-serve, as you kind of mentioned earlier on the call? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So I think about -- if you think about EA for Q4, it tends to be a large renewal quarter, but what we're talking about in terms of the guide is because we had such strength in multiyear, that's where we would expect to see our EA down sequentially, which is not typically our pattern, which is why we called it out. In terms of AI workloads and some of those other things, I think it's early to tell and obviously, we'll continue to evolve and assess our view when we get to the full-year guide in March. And then we'll also have an updated view on how the cohorts are behaving and sort of how multiyear played out. But I think in terms of Q4, the comments that I made earlier hopefully will help. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst Yeah. Okay, perfect. And then the -- and can you talk a little bit about like obviously, there's a debate of like which database will be the persistent layer if you do AI projects, et cetera. What do you see from the big hyperscalers in terms of working with you guys and partnerships? We obviously just have AWS kind of summit, et-cetera. Can you speak a little bit like how your relationship with those big guys is evolving around this? And Michael, All the best in case I don't talk to you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, I'll start with the partnerships first, like our -- with AWS, as you said, they just had their re:Invent show last week. Our -- it remains very, very strong. We've closed a ton of deals this past quarter. Some of them very, very large deals. We're doing integrations to some of the new products like Q and Bedrock and the engagement in the field has been really strong. On Azure, I think we -- as I've shared in the past, we start-off with a little bit of a slow start, but in the words of the person who runs their partner leadership, the Azure MongoDB relationship has never been stronger. We've closed a large number of deals. We're part of what's called the Azure native IC service program and have a bunch of deep integrations with Azure, including Fabric, Power BI, Visual Studio, Semantic Kernel, and Azure OpenAI Studio. And we're also one of Azure's largest marketplace partners. And GCP does -- we have actually seen some uptick in terms of co-sales that we've done this past quarter and GCP made some comp changes where they -- that were favorable to working with MongoDB that we saw some results in the field, and we're focused on closing on -- closing a handful of large deals with GCP in Q4. So in general, I would say, things are going quite well. And then in terms of, I guess, implying your question was like the hyperscalers and are they potentially bundling things along with their AI offerings? I mean, candidly, since day one, the hyperscalers have been bundling their database offerings with every offering that they have and that's been their predominant strategy. And we've -- I think we've executed well against strategy because databases are not like a by-the-way decision. It's an important decision. And I think the hyperscalers are seeing our performance and realize it's better to partner with us. And as I said, customers understand the importance of the data layer, especially for AI applications. And so the partnership across all three hyperscalers is strong. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst OK, perfect. Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Raimo. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. The next question will be coming from the line of Brad Sills of Bank of America. Your line is open. Brad Sills -- Analyst Great. Thank you so much, and congratulations, Michael, on your next move. I wanted to ask about new workloads here on vector search, stream processing, relational migrator. Is there any one of those three that's ramping faster than maybe you expected? Just a little bit of color on how those new workload types are ramping. Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I'll kind of give you just a rundown of some of the -- I mean, essentially you're asking about the new products, like our -- on search, we introduced a new capability called Atlas search nodes, which where you can asymmetrically scale your search nodes because if you have a search-intensive use case, you don't have to scale all your nodes because they have become quite expensive. And we've seen that this kind of groundbreaking capability really well received. The demand is quite high and because customers like they can tune the configuration to the unique needs of their search requirements. One of the world's largest banks is using Atlas Search to provide like a Google-like search experience on payments data for massive corporate customers. So this is a customer-facing application and so performance, and scalability are critical. A leading provider of AI-powered accounting software uses Atlas Search to power its invoice analytics future, which allows end users and finance teams to perform ad-hoc analysis and easily find past-due invoices and voices that contain errors. So that search -- on vector search, it -- again, and it's been our kind of our first full-year since going generally available. And the product uptake has been actually very, very high. In Q3, we released quantization for Atlas Vector Search, which reduces the memory requirements by up to 96%, allowing us to support larger vector workloads with vastly improved price performance. For example, a multinational news organization created a GenAI powered tool designed to help producers and journalists efficiently search, summarize, and verify information from vast and varied data sources. A leading security firm is using Atlas Vector Search to fight AI fraud and a leading global media company replaced elastic search with hybrid search and vector search use case for a user recommendation engine that's built to suggest -- that's built in to suggest articles to end users. And so that's super exciting to see as well. We're also seeing a lot of interest in our streaming product, demand is very high. We just rolled it out to another hyperscaler, and customers are commenting on that the use cases of being able to embed stream processing with MongoDB makes our life so much easier. So overall, we're quite pleased with the progress we're making on the new products. And as I said before, natively bundling all these capabilities really reduces or eliminates the need for customers to have to bolt on a bunch of different technologies to solve the same problem, saving them a lot of time, money, cost, and risk. Brad Sills -- Analyst That's really exciting. Thanks, Dev. And then I wanted to ask a question around Cedric's appointment. Any focus that may be different here under his leadership that we should be thinking about going forward? Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer No, Cedric has been our CRO for, gosh, now like I think like five, six years, and he -- I was the Interim CRO for about three quarters until he took over when we last made a change and this is really an expansion of his responsibilities. I've known Cedric for a long time. He and I have worked with at multiple different companies. I think I have a good barometer for understanding sales leadership. There's a number of sales leaders who worked at other top-tier software companies who used to work for me or with me. And so I'm super-excited by the role Cedric is going to take and then we're also making some changes under Cedric to better align the different organizations so that we can more tightly work together on going up-market, on app monetization and positioning ourselves well to be the ideal database for GenAI apps. Brad Sills -- Analyst Super exciting. Thanks, Dev. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Brad. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question, please. Our next question will be coming from the line of Mike Cikos of Needham and Company. Your line is open. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Hey guys, thanks for taking the question here. I just wanted to come back to the consumption growth being slightly better than expectations again for the second quarter in a row now. And apologies if I missed it, but this improvement that we're seeing, is this across all vintages and geographies or is it potentially more concentrated in scope? Just trying to get a better understanding of what's seeking place out there and what's embedded in the guide. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. No, I would describe it as broad-based, Mike. And obviously, we're pleased to see it and we're continuing monitoring and slicing and dicing it in different ways. And as we have information or insights to you, we'll share it. And without trying to throw a whole bunch of cold water on our mind, it was slightly better, or a step-function changed better, but good to see. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Terrific. And maybe for a quick follow-up for Dev. I think it builds off maybe Tyler's question at the top of the Q&A, but you had cited that some customers are thinking about their workloads more holistically and even looking to run AI workloads on-prem. How much of that do you think is just a function of customers are still trying to figure out how to optimize for latency and cost or is this more a demonstration of we really are in the early phases of the exploratory phase versus going into production? Is there any way to coarse that out or is the two not necessarily connected? Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer No, I think it's kind of a little bit of both. I think you have some customers who are very committed to running a big part of the estate on-prem. So by definition, then if they're going to build an AI workload, it has to be run on-prem, which means that they also need access to GPUs and they're doing that. And then other customers are leveraging basically renting GPUs from the cloud providers and building their own AI workloads. I do think we're in the very, very early days. They're still learning, experimenting. More-and-more apps are entering production. And as I said on the prepared remarks, we have thousands of workload -- AI workloads running on MongoDB, but a very small percentage of them have demonstrated meaningful product market fit. And so the initial traction is kind of still small. But I think as people get more sophisticated with AI, as the AI technology matures and becomes more and more useful, I think applications will -- you'll start seeing these applications take-off. I kind of chuckled that today I see more senior leaders bragging about the chips they're using versus the apps they're building. So it just tells you that we're still in the very, very early days of this big platform shift. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Great point. Thank you again, guys. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Mike. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Eric Heath of KeyBanc. Your line is open. Eric Heath -- Analyst Hi, thanks for taking the question. Dev, Michael, it sounds like the takeaway from the call is a greater focus on EA and on enterprise. So should we structurally rethink the EA business differently and think of this more as a healthy double-digit growth business going forward for the foreseeable future? And then if I could just ask a follow-up question separate to that. But Michael, I understand that it's still early to identify the fiscal '25 cohort of workloads, but just curious at a high-level if they look and feel like of higher quality than the fiscal '24 cohort of workflow. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Do you want to take on the first one in terms of EA... Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, I mean, I would say, I mean, we are very committed to our run anywhere strategy. And as I said, we are first investing in community where for many customers is the first way they experience MongoDB. And we want them to have the full experience of integrating search and Vector search into our core product. And so they can out of the gate really start building applications. That will then transition to building those capabilities into EA. So, we are clearly investing in the EA product. But Atlas is still a big, big part of our business and a big, big part of our growth engine and we typically launch new features on Atlas and because of the capabilities we already have, the fact it's multi-cloud makes it a very, very compelling offering for many customers. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. And I think in terms of the workloads, I do think it's early. Just as a reminder for folks, they tend to start small, although grow quickly. I think the only other thing that I can add is, we've been pretty consistent and that we've been pleased with the new business that we've done. But we need some time to let the cohorts play out as we track them. But I think like I said, we've been happy with the new business that we were winning. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of William Power of Baird. Your line is open. Brian Raferty Denyeau -- Investor Relations You there, William? William Power -- Analyst Sorry, yeah. Thank you. Dev, you had some encouraging comments on relational migrator. I wonder if you could just touch on what you think is driving the higher interest here. I mean, it sounds like AI is contributing and helping, but it'd be great to get some more color there because that still feels like obviously a meaningful long-term opportunity. And then maybe the second part of the question for Dev or Michael, just be great to get any other framework around the professional services investments. Any way to kind of think about quantification and timing of that? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So the reason we're so excited about the opportunity to go after legacy applications is that, one, it seems like there's a confluence of events happening. One is that the increasing cost and tax of supporting and managing these legacy apps are just going up enough. Second, for many customers who are in regulated industries, the regulators are calling their -- the fact that they're running on these legacy apps with systemic risk, so they can no longer kick the can down the road. Third, also because they no longer can kick the can around, some vendors are going end-of-life, so they have to make a decision to migrate those applications to a more modern tech stack. Fourth, because GenAI is so predicated on data and to build a competitive advantage, you need to leverage your proprietary data, people want to access that data and be able to do so easily. And so that's another reason for them to want to modernize. And then you also have people who built those applications who are retiring or just no longer in the firm, so it just creates more and more risk for the companies. Given all that, customers are incredibly interested in figuring out a way to easily and safely and securely migrate those -- off those applications. And we always could help them very easily move the data and map the schema from a relational schema to a document schema. The hardest part was essentially rewriting the application. Now with the advent of GenAI, you can now significantly reduce the time. One, you can use GenAI to analyze existing code. Two, you can use GenAI to reverse engineer tests to test what the code does. And then three, you can use GenAI to build new code and then users test it to ensure that the new code produces the same results as the old code. And so all that time and effort is suddenly cut in a meaningful way and that's suddenly creating a lot of interest from customers saying, my goodness. And if you're already on a relational app, moving to another relational app doesn't feel like modernization. So, the other advantage is that moving to MongoDB gives them a much more modern platform, a much more agile, flexible, performant, and scalable platform for their future needs. And that's why we're so excited. Again, it's early days. We've run a number of pilots that have gone well. We're in the process of working with some customers now in the migration process. This will take time because these are very, very complex applications. And actually, one thing I also mentioned was that they're not just going after -- saying go after some tertiary Tier 2 or Tier 3 application, they're saying, hey, we want you to look at some of our crown jewels because these are the apps that are most painful for us. So that's also very exciting. But again, this will take time, but we're very committed to this, and we think this is going to drive -- help us drive long-term -- meaningful long-term growth. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, Will. And to the last part of your question on the professional services investment, we're really building out that capacity in order to meet the demand that we're seeing relative to the opportunity. We're calling it in particular because it has a gross margin impact because that's where that will typically show up. And then maybe the last thing and it's probably obvious, but just to sort of underscore it is the reason we're doing this though is for the ARR, right, to drive the new workloads, the additional workloads over to MongoDB as part of that migration. And over time, as we've talked about before, we hope and expect to be able to leverage technology more and more, but at least initially and into the medium-term, there's going to be a healthy human/services component to that. Just wanted to sort of effectively telegraph that out to folks. William Power -- Analyst That's helpful. Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Will. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Rudy Kessinger of DA Davidson. Please go ahead. Rudy Kessinger -- Analyst Hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in here. I believe last quarter you said consumption growth slightly ahead of expectations. And while down slower year-over-year growth versus Q2 last year, the year-over-year growth did improve from Q1. And so, I guess I'm curious for Q3, could you make a comment in that same regard? Obviously, slower on a year-over-year basis than Q3 last year, but was it stable with year-over-year consumption growth in Q2 or better or worse? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Rudy, thanks for the question. We haven't specifically called that out relative to Q2. We did see a lower year-over-year growth as we called out. We did see a seasonal rebound. Usually Q3 is stronger than Q2 and we talked about how that was smaller than in the prior year. So hopefully, that will help you all triangulate. Rudy Kessinger -- Analyst Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. I believe it was on your Q4 call back in March. At that point, Dev, you said it would be at least another year until AI applications are being deployed at scale. It sounds like the commentary that some early large workloads, but out of the thousands, just not many that are at large scale. I guess, is your expectation now that maybe it's still at least another year until we're seeing broad AI application rollouts at scale? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I think a lot of it's a function of the what's happening in the R&D side of AI, right? So for example, today, we don't have a very compelling model designed for our phones, right, because today the phones don't have the computing horsepower to run complex models. So, you don't see a ton of very, very successful consumer apps besides, say, ChatGPT or Claude. So we don't -- we also don't see like hundreds of apps taking off like you saw kind of the first generation of like the Internet or the cloud era, right, or the mobile era. So like I think we're still in the early days of AI. And so while we see a lot of people building AI apps, a lot of them have kind of fairly rudimentary functionality. But I think that over time that's going to change. In fact, I know it will change. I just can't predict when that will happen. But where we do see apps having production, we are having traction, we're seeing them grow very, very quickly and we have a lot of them on our platform. It's just very few of them are really have meaningful. Operator Thank you. And that concludes today's Q&A session. I would like to go ahead and turn the call back over to Dev for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, everyone. I just wanted to say we're really pleased with our Q3 results with strong new business performance and revenue exceeding expectations both -- across both Atlas and EA. We're making the necessary investments to expand our enterprise channel where we see the largest opportunity to establish MongoDB as a standard and the strongest returns on our go-to-market investments. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the progress we're making on both accelerating legacy app modernization with AI as well as establishing ourselves as a standard of the emerging AI tech stack for greenfield AI applications. And last but not least, I would like to thank Michael again for his contributions over the past 10 years and wish him well. Thank you, everyone, and we'll talk to you soon.

congratulate cedric well-deserved promotion. that, let turn call michael. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer thanks, dev, thanks kind word incredible partnership past decade. past 10 year rewarding professional career extremely proud achieved together course, whole mongodb team. much success had, still believe mongodb early stage realizing full potential continues take share one largest market software. now, turning result quarter. begin detailed review third-quarter result finish outlook fourth quarter full fiscal year 2025. first, start third quarter results. total revenue quarter $529.4 million, 22% year-over-year high end guidance. shifting product mix, atlas grew 26% quarter compared previous year represents 68% total revenue compared 66% third quarter fiscal 2024 71% last quarter. recognized atlas revenue primarily based customer consumption platform consumption closely tied end user activity applications. let provide context atlas consumption quarter. q3, consumption slightly ahead expectations. year's q3 seasonal improvement muted year past expected. year-over-year basis, consumption growth remains prior year period. turning non-atlas revenue. non-atlas came significantly ahead expectations. dev mentioned, ea new business strong, continue success selling incremental workload existing customer base. addition, q3 non-atlas revenue benefited large multi-year deals. know, due asc 606, recognized entire term license component multi-year contract start contract. compared q3 last year, multi-year license component non-atlas revenue $15 million higher. turning customer growth. third quarter, grew customer base approximately 1,900 customer sequentially, bringing total customer count 52,600, 46,400 year-ago period. total customer count, 7,400 direct sale customers, compare 6,900 year-ago period. growth total customer count driven primarily atlas, 51,100 customer end quarter compared 44,900 year-ago period. important keep mind growth atlas customer count reflects new customer mongodb addition existing ea customer adding first atlas workload. continuing on, q3, net arr expansion rate approximately 120%. ended quarter 2,314 customer least $100,000 arr annualized mrr, $1,972 year-ago period. moving income statement, discussing result non-gaap basis unless otherwise noted. gross profit third quarter $405.7 million, representing gross margin 77%, flat versus year-ago period. income operation $101.5 million 19% operating margin third quarter compared 18% operating margin year-ago period. primary reason favorable operating income result versus guidance revenue outperformance, including high margin multi-year license revenue benefit. net income third quarter $98.1 million $1.16 per share, based 84.2 million diluted weighted average share outstanding. compare net income $79.1 million $0.96 per share 83.7 million diluted weighted-average share outstanding year-ago period. turning balance sheet cash flow, ended third quarter $2.3 billion cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash. operating cash flow third quarter $37.4 million. taking consideration approximately $2.9 million capital expenditure principal repayment finance lease liabilities, free cash flow $34.6 million quarter. compare free cash flow $35 million year-ago period. q3, incur capital expenditure purchase ipv4 address previously expected, start making purchase november still expect total outlay $20 million $25 million fiscal year previously communicated. like turn outlook fourth quarter full fiscal year 2025. fourth quarter, expect revenue range $515 million $519 million. expect non-gaap income operation range $55 million $58 million non-gaap net income per share range $0.62 $0.65 based 84.9 million

income per share range $3.01 $3.03 based 84 million estimated diluted weighted-average share outstanding. note non-gaap net income per share guidance fourth-quarter full-fiscal year 2025 includes non-gaap tax provision approximately 20%. provide context around updated guidance. first, term atlas consumption, expect see typical seasonal slowdown q4, driven underlying application usage moderating holiday season. second, since atlas consumption remained lower year-over-year basis q3, expect see continued deceleration atlas year-over-year growth q4. third, expect see sequential decline non-atlas revenue q4, contrary normal pattern. reason experienced significant additional benefit multi-year deal q3, expect recur q4. addition, want provide incremental color recent product -- recent product go-to-market change impact growth reported customer count going forward. first, dev explained, reallocating portion go-to-market resource mid-market enterprise channel. result, expect see significantly fewer mid-market direct sale customer net addition result, slower direct sale customer growth going forward. believe reallocation investment dollar drive higher revenue growth time. so, trade-off make sense. second, introduce atlas flex cluster q4 automatically migrate customer q1, expect see one-time negative impact customer count since approximately 4,000 serverless customer low spending expect transition flex. customer negligible impact revenue impact reported customer count. summarize, pleased third quarter result especially ability win new business. small share one largest fastest-growing market software number secular tailwinds, including ai back. continue investing judiciously focusing execution capture long-term opportunity. that, like open questions. operator? question & answers: operator [operator instructions] first question day coming sanjit singh morgan stanley. line open. sanjit singh -- analyst thank taking question congrats, michael, outstanding career. absolutely fantastic run mongodb. excited see next, excited take breather. congrats, michael. guess take question -- start questions, look atlas past two quarters, correct wrong, think consumption coming least modestly ahead expectations. relative seen beginning year, sort -- function sale execution? function end-user activity sort improving? what's driving least improvement atlas consumption past two quarters? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. different things. think look outlook beginning year, indicated thought would see stable atlas growth consumption standpoint. seen talked -- actually seen lower year-over-year growth based underlying consumption. -- that's incorporated q4 guide. seen q3 q4 -- sorry, q2 q3, excuse me, better expectations, still year-over-year basis. want make sure sort confusing comparative set year-over-year versus relative expectations. sanjit singh -- analyst understood. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer core it, sanjit, question really underlying usage applications. sanjit singh -- analyst yeah, make total sense. then, dev, ask ai agent question. term ai agent needing context, going set tool take actions. mean mongodb operational data store customer start roll agentic applications? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. so, talk agents, think think agents, there's jobs, there's -- sorry, there's job, there's project there's task. right now, agent rolled really focused task like say something sierra company rolling agents. right, deemed deal able create rich complex data structures. important ai ai model look isolated data points, need understand relationships, hierarchies, pattern within data. need able essentially get real-time insights. example, chatbot someone querying, customer kind trying get update order placed five minute ago may gotten confirmation, chatbot need able deal real-time information. need able deal basically handling advanced use cases, understanding like, thing like fraud detection understand behavior supply chains, need understand intricate data relationships. thing consistent mongodb offers. believe end day, well-positioned handle this. thing would say embedded natural way search vector search. oltp database, tech search vector search. that's one experience platform offer that, think real advantage. integrated leading ai framework platforms. enterprise-grade security compliance, customer run u anywhere, either 118 cloud region on-prem, huge differentiator us. sanjit singh -- analyst awesome. appreciate thoughts, dev. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, sanjit. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line taylor -- tyler radke citi. line open. tyler radke -- analyst hi, thank much taking question. and, michael, best, congratulation 10 years. going back sale execution, mean, one thing talked earlier year challenge term recently acquired workload ramping. think lot past fiscal year. curious quality workload acquisition trended year. think ramp consumption potential next year, sort look versus time year ago? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. maybe talk change made michael talk little bit consumption trends. so, make change beginning year, really wanted focus volume quality workload slight adjustment made. think change reasonable positive impact. again, early declare victory workload usually start small grow time, really pleased result seeing far. -- again, early days. obviously, know fiscal '25 workload go fiscal '26. far, good. michael, consumption? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, couple things, thanks, tyler. fiscal '24 cohort called earlier, slower growth continue. line revised expectations. made change talked -- earlier year affect fiscal '25 cohorts, early tell. those, need quarter data really see -- seeing behave differently. say talked new business environment success new business. pleased that, show kind initial piece, need see grow cohort evolve. tyler radke -- analyst great. thanks. follow-up ea side, talked outsized strength non-atlas business quarter. maybe could unpack like relative upside driven simply duration versus new business. know called duration impact year-over-year, -- feel like sort one-off feel like maybe bigger customer indexing toward ea impact way think product introducing thing like vector search stream processing onto on-prem product? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah, thank you. overall, continue find ea product resonate customers. important part run anywhere strategy continued see success people wanting increase investment mongodb. there's always multiyear component continue see that. talked beginning year fiscal '24 abnormally high amount multi-year benefit therefore, anticipating headwind quantified roughly $40 million range. talked call earlier saw large accounts, surprising amount multiyear positively benefited q3 little $15 million revenue compared saw q3 year ago. so, much headwind expecting. obviously, 606 dynamics, things, especially large deal kind meaty chunky lumpy, try call sort help people understand, there's pretty healthy kind baseline flow, ea, also multiyear. see spikes, try call you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. want add, tyler, investing call ea business. first, starting investing search vector search community product. couple thing us. one, whenever anyone start mongodb open-source product, immediately get benefit complete highly integrated platform. two, capability migrate ea. so, ea u investment strategy. definitely see lot large customer very, committed running workload on-prem. even see customer want run run ai workload on-prem. so, optionality get using mongodb on-prem cloud, also cross-cloud compelling one. tyler radke -- analyst thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line brad reback stifel. line open. brad reback -- analyst great. thanks much. and, michael, best luck. great run. dev, started call talking bunch investments, great given growth business. obviously, talked reallocating expenses. net-net, think incremental investment phase next year gating margin upside? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer think that's something obviously ready talk next year now, would say -- reason looking invest summarize again, going up-market legacy app modernization see large workload potentially play ideal database genai apps, future important investment drive long-term growth. quite energized investment that's something high conviction on. brad reback -- analyst that's great. maap program, workload going wind atlas healthy combination ea atlas? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer think early days. would say -- would probably say side atlas ea early days. think introduce search vector search ea product, see on-prem. obviously, people use mongodb ai workload using technology well conjunction mongodb on-prem ai use cases. would say probably going see happen first atlas. brad reback -- analyst great. thanks much. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line jason ader william blair. line open. jason ader -- analyst yeah, thank you. going belabor congratulating michael, fun working best luck. question strength ea. think, dev, represents comment enterprise might rethinking reassessing kind on-prem versus cloud workload placement decision? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer well, think large enterprises, think large enterprise meaningful workload still running on-prem. think belief everything would go cloud probably something really popular good old day zurp. think customer assess investment already place, much judicious run workload think leverage existing investment infrastructure, going so. also bunch reason like regulatory reasons, customer quite moving aggressively cloud. see particularly europe, see lot european bank still running majority workload on-prem. also varies region conversely asia, seeing people much move much aggressively cloud. think really depends industry, geography, personal dynamic what's happening particular account. mean, see large u bank also committed running thing on-prem. really varies. that's feel really good run anywhere strategy give customer optionality. build something run on-prem. choose move cloud, easy mongodb. jason ader -- analyst right. follow-up also investment making strategic sale enterprise. could get little specific investment might be? hiring lot new salespeople? working sis, investing sis? additional detail would helpful. thanks. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. everyone's benefit, identified number accounts, call strategic accounts, think high upside us. seen number account grow quickly deploy right mix resources. necessarily quota-carrying resources. could additional technical sale resources, additional p resources, additional customer service resource better service support accounts. even thing like run education session developer accounts, called either hackathons like call developer day even design review meet development team looking build application, help think would potentially use mongodb build particular app. find many developers, experience mongodb quite limited, engage them, educate show simple easy is. like example, customer today think like use oltp database, search database, maybe vector database, like caching database. integrated mongodb. sudden, customer say, wow, simplify life, simplify back-end infrastructure, build app far quickly much easier manage long-term everything mongodb. really function educating power mongodb really open lot opportunity us. that's doubling down, mix resource really predicated accounts, quota counting resources, whole suite resource bringing table. jason ader -- analyst thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line andrew nowinski well fargo. line open. andrew nowinski -- analyst okay. good afternoon. thank much taking question congrats nice quarter. gave example customer migrated postgres think said issue pg vector function. wondering long customer using postgres decided make change mongo, meaning sort like rebound type customer chose pg -- excuse me, postgres work? frequently seeing type transition? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. can't give specific long using postgres, -- trend seeing business. remember postgres 40-year-old technology. -- beneficiary people lifting shifting type relational databases, oracle, sql server, mysql, et cetera. open-source database. part -- open-source relational database, inherent challenge relational database do. quite inflexible. build schema, hard change schema. hard scale hard distribute data. large data volumes, weird thing like, example, resort off-road storage large data objects, creates performance bottlenecks. again, people default postgres know anything better know relational everyone kind moving relational platforms. that's whole point saying earlier. educate developer flexibility schema, easily horizontally scale rich query language aggregation sophisticated geospatial indexes, productivity gain using document model easy organize data, -- people like, wow, life much easier. want clear, zero-sum game. postgres fail u successful. big market quite excited opportunity, see customer moving postgres coming mongodb. andrew nowinski -- analyst thank you. helpful. maybe quick follow-up. normalize $15 million multiyear deal impact q3, would ea still sequentially q4? thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer given level guidance, trying help understand context full-year number headwind talked beginning year, given strength saw q3. andrew nowinski -- analyst got it. thanks. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line raimo lenschow barclays. line open. raimo lenschow -- analyst hey, thank you. think ea strength quarter, michael, kind give u little bit there. like think renewal -- renewal situation renewal pool coming like q3, coming q4, et cetera, well like mean term upsell, cross-sell opportunity people think starting ai project self-serve, kind mentioned earlier call? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. think -- think ea q4, tends large renewal quarter, talking term guide strength multiyear, that's would expect see ea sequentially, typically pattern, called out. term ai workload things, think early tell obviously, continue evolve assess view get full-year guide march. also updated view cohort behaving sort multiyear played out. think term q4, comment made earlier hopefully help. raimo lenschow -- analyst yeah. okay, perfect. -- talk little bit like obviously, there's debate like database persistent layer ai projects, et cetera. see big hyperscalers term working guy partnerships? obviously aws kind summit, et-cetera. speak little bit like relationship big guy evolving around this? michael, best case talk you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. so, start partnership first, like -- aws, said, re:invent show last week. -- remains very, strong. closed ton deal past quarter. very, large deals. integration new product like q bedrock engagement field really strong. azure, think -- shared past, start-off little bit slow start, word person run partner leadership, azure mongodb relationship never stronger. closed large number deals. part what's called azure native ic service program bunch deep integration azure, including fabric, power bi, visual studio, semantic kernel, azure openai studio. also one azure's largest marketplace partners. gcp -- actually seen uptick term co-sales done past quarter gcp made comp change -- favorable working mongodb saw result field, focused closing -- closing handful large deal gcp q4. general, would say, thing going quite well. term of, guess, implying question like hyperscalers potentially bundling thing along ai offerings? mean, candidly, since day one, hyperscalers bundling database offering every offering that's predominant strategy. -- think executed well strategy database like by-the-way decision. important decision. think hyperscalers seeing performance realize better partner us. said, customer understand importance data layer, especially ai applications. partnership across three hyperscalers strong. raimo lenschow -- analyst ok, perfect. thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer thanks, raimo. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line brad sill bank america. line open. brad sill -- analyst great. thank much, congratulations, michael, next move. wanted ask new workload vector search, stream processing, relational migrator. one three that's ramping faster maybe expected? little bit color new workload type ramping. thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. kind give rundown -- mean, essentially asking new products, like -- search, introduced new capability called atlas search nodes, asymmetrically scale search node search-intensive use case, scale node become quite expensive. seen kind groundbreaking capability really well received. demand quite high customer like tune configuration unique need search requirements. one world's largest bank using atlas search provide like google-like search experience payment data massive corporate customers. customer-facing application performance, scalability critical. leading provider ai-powered accounting software us atlas search power invoice analytics future, allows end user finance team perform ad-hoc analysis easily find past-due invoice voice contain errors. search -- vector search, -- again, kind first full-year since going generally available. product uptake actually very, high. q3, released quantization atlas vector search, reduces memory requirement 96%, allowing u support larger vector workload vastly improved price performance. example, multinational news organization created genai powered tool designed help producer journalist efficiently search, summarize, verify information vast varied data sources. leading security firm using atlas vector search fight ai fraud leading global medium company replaced elastic search hybrid search vector search use case user recommendation engine that's built suggest -- that's built suggest article end users. that's super exciting see well. also seeing lot interest streaming product, demand high. rolled another hyperscaler, customer commenting use case able embed stream processing mongodb make life much easier. overall, quite pleased progress making new products. said before, natively bundling capability really reduces eliminates need customer bolt bunch different technology solve problem, saving lot time, money, cost, risk. brad sill -- analyst that's really exciting. thanks, dev. wanted ask question around cedric's appointment. focus may different leadership thinking going forward? thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer no, cedric cro for, gosh, like think like five, six years, -- interim cro three quarter took last made change really expansion responsibilities. known cedric long time. worked multiple different companies. think good barometer understanding sale leadership. there's number sale leader worked top-tier software company used work me. super-excited role cedric going take also making change cedric better align different organization tightly work together going up-market, app monetization positioning well ideal database genai apps. brad sill -- analyst super exciting. thanks, dev. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer thanks, brad. operator thank you. one moment next question, please. next question coming line mike cikos needham company. line open. mike cikos -- analyst hey guys, thanks taking question here. wanted come back consumption growth slightly better expectation second quarter row now. apology missed it, improvement seeing, across vintage geography potentially concentrated scope? trying get better understanding what's seeking place what's embedded guide. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. no, would describe broad-based, mike. obviously, pleased see continuing monitoring slicing dicing different ways. information insight you, share it. without trying throw whole bunch cold water mind, slightly better, step-function changed better, good see. mike cikos -- analyst terrific. maybe quick follow-up dev. think build maybe tyler's question top q&a, cited customer thinking workload holistically even looking run ai workload on-prem. much think function customer still trying figure optimize latency cost demonstration really early phase exploratory phase versus going production? way coarse two necessarily connected? thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer no, think kind little bit both. think customer committed running big part estate on-prem. definition, going build ai workload, run on-prem, mean also need access gpus that. customer leveraging basically renting gpus cloud provider building ai workloads. think very, early days. still learning, experimenting. more-and-more apps entering production. said prepared remarks, thousand workload -- ai workload running mongodb, small percentage demonstrated meaningful product market fit. initial traction kind still small. think people get sophisticated ai, ai technology matures becomes useful, think application -- start seeing application take-off. kind chuckled today see senior leader bragging chip using versus apps building. tell still very, early day big platform shift. mike cikos -- analyst great point. thank again, guys. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, mike. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line eric heath keybanc. line open. eric heath -- analyst hi, thanks taking question. dev, michael, sound like takeaway call greater focus ea enterprise. structurally rethink ea business differently think healthy double-digit growth business going forward foreseeable future? could ask follow-up question separate that. michael, understand still early identify fiscal '25 cohort workloads, curious high-level look feel like higher quality fiscal '24 cohort workflow. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer want take first one term ea... michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, mean, would say, mean, committed run anywhere strategy. said, first investing community many customer first way experience mongodb. want full experience integrating search vector search core product. gate really start building applications. transition building capability ea. so, clearly investing ea product. atlas still big, big part business big, big part growth engine typically launch new feature atlas capability already have, fact multi-cloud make very, compelling offering many customers. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. think term workloads, think early. reminder folks, tend start small, although grow quickly. think thing add is, pretty consistent pleased new business done. need time let cohort play track them. think like said, happy new business winning. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line william power baird. line open. brian raferty denyeau -- investor relation there, william? william power -- analyst sorry, yeah. thank you. dev, encouraging comment relational migrator. wonder could touch think driving higher interest here. mean, sound like ai contributing helping, great get color still feel like obviously meaningful long-term opportunity. maybe second part question dev michael, great get framework around professional service investments. way kind think quantification timing that? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. reason excited opportunity go legacy application that, one, seems like there's confluence event happening. one increasing cost tax supporting managing legacy apps going enough. second, many customer regulated industries, regulator calling -- fact running legacy apps systemic risk, longer kick road. third, also longer kick around, vendor going end-of-life, make decision migrate application modern tech stack. fourth, genai predicated data build competitive advantage, need leverage proprietary data, people want access data able easily. that's another reason want modernize. also people built application retiring longer firm, creates risk companies. given that, customer incredibly interested figuring way easily safely securely migrate -- applications. always could help easily move data map schema relational schema document schema. hardest part essentially rewriting application. advent genai, significantly reduce time. one, use genai analyze existing code. two, use genai reverse engineer test test code does. three, use genai build new code user test ensure new code produce result old code. time effort suddenly cut meaningful way that's suddenly creating lot interest customer saying, goodness. already relational app, moving another relational app feel like modernization. so, advantage moving mongodb give much modern platform, much agile, flexible, performant, scalable platform future needs. that's excited. again, early days. run number pilot gone well. process working customer migration process. take time very, complex applications. actually, one thing also mentioned going -- saying go tertiary tier 2 tier 3 application, saying, hey, want look crown jewel apps painful us. that's also exciting. again, take time, committed this, think going drive -- help u drive long-term -- meaningful long-term growth. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, will. last part question professional service investment, really building capacity order meet demand seeing relative opportunity. calling particular gross margin impact that's typically show up. maybe last thing probably obvious, sort underscore reason though arr, right, drive new workloads, additional workload mongodb part migration. time, talked before, hope expect able leverage technology more, least initially medium-term, there's going healthy human/services component that. wanted sort effectively telegraph folks. william power -- analyst that's helpful. thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, will. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line rudy kessinger da davidson. please go ahead. rudy kessinger -- analyst hey guys, thanks squeezing here. believe last quarter said consumption growth slightly ahead expectations. slower year-over-year growth versus q2 last year, year-over-year growth improve q1. so, guess curious q3, could make comment regard? obviously, slower year-over-year basis q3 last year, stable year-over-year consumption growth q2 better worse? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. rudy, thanks question. specifically called relative q2. see lower year-over-year growth called out. see seasonal rebound. usually q3 stronger q2 talked smaller prior year. hopefully, help triangulate. rudy kessinger -- analyst okay. quick follow-up. believe q4 call back march. point, dev, said would least another year ai application deployed scale. sound like commentary early large workloads, thousands, many large scale. guess, expectation maybe still least another year seeing broad ai application rollouts scale? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. think lot function what's happening r&d side ai, right? example, today, compelling model designed phones, right, today phone computing horsepower run complex models. so, see ton very, successful consumer apps besides, say, chatgpt claude. -- also see like hundred apps taking like saw kind first generation like internet cloud era, right, mobile era. like think still early day ai. see lot people building ai apps, lot kind fairly rudimentary functionality. think time that's going change. fact, know change. can't predict happen. see apps production, traction, seeing grow very, quickly lot platform. really meaningful. operator thank you. concludes today's q&a session. would like go ahead turn call back dev closing remarks. please go ahead. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thank you, everyone. wanted say really pleased q3 result strong new business performance revenue exceeding expectation -- across atlas ea. making necessary investment expand enterprise channel see largest opportunity establish mongodb standard strongest return go-to-market investments. looking ahead, encouraged progress making accelerating legacy app modernization ai well establishing standard emerging ai tech stack greenfield ai applications. last least, would like thank michael contribution past 10 year wish well. thank you, everyone, talk soon. operator [operator

Please refer to the tables in our earnings release in the Investor Relations portion of our website for a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dev. Dev? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we had a strong quarter of new business and executed well against our large market opportunity. Let's begin by reviewing our third quarter results before giving you a broader company update. We generated revenue of $529 million, a 22% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew 26% year-over-year, representing 68% of total revenue. We generated non-GAAP operating income of $101 million for a 19% non-GAAP operating margin and we ended the quarter with over 52,600 customers. Overall, we were pleased with our performance in the third quarter. We had a strong new business quarter and we're happy with our new workload acquisition on Atlas. Our non-Atlas business significantly exceeded expectations in part because we benefited from a few large multi-year deals as customers continue to value our run anywhere strategy and want to build a deeper longer-term relationship with MongoDB. Atlas consumption was slightly better than expected in a macro-environment that we would characterize as largely consistent with what we saw in the first half of the year. Michael will cover consumption trends in more detail. Retention rates remained strong in Q3, demonstrating the mission criticality of our platform. On our Q1 earnings call, we shared with you the three major strategic initiatives that we believe will enable us to maximize our long-term opportunity. I want to give you an update on the progress we're making on those initiatives. First, we are increasing our investment in the enterprise channel since we see the strongest returns in this part of the market. Specifically, we're expanding our strategic account program going to next year, as we see more accounts that will benefit from incremental investment. In addition, we're investing time and resources to educate developers in large enterprise accounts and uplevel their MongoDB skills. These organizations have thousands of developers and as we penetrate them more deeply, we encounter developers who have historically only built SQL applications and simply do not know how to use MongoDB to its full potential. In our experience, educating these developers on the benefits of MongoDB drives significant incremental adoption of our platform. To fund these up-market investments, we are reallocating a portion of our mid-market investments. The mid-market remains an attractive opportunity for us, but we believe that prioritizing investment up-market will deliver strong returns in the current environment. We also believe there are additional ways to serve the mid-market more efficiently through our self-serve channel and other scaled technology-enabled sales and customer service motions. Second, we are optimistic about the opportunity to accelerate legacy app modernization using AI and are investing more in this area. As you recall, we ran a few successful pilots earlier this year, demonstrating that AI tooling combined with professional services and our relational migrator product can significantly reduce the time, cost, and risk of migrating legacy applications onto MongoDB. While it's early days, we have observed a more than 50% reduction in the cost to modernize. On the back of these strong early results, additional customer interest is exceeding our expectations. Large enterprises in every industry and geography are experiencing acute pain from their legacy infrastructure and are eager for more agile, performant, and cost-effective solutions. Not only are customers excited to engage with us, they also want to focus on some of the most important applications in their enterprise, further demonstrating the level of interest and size of the long-term opportunity. As relational applications encompass a wide variety of database types, programming languages, versions, and other customer-specific variables, we expect modernization projects to continue to include meaningful service engagements in the short and medium term. Consequently, we're increasing our professional services delivery capabilities, both directly and through partners. In the long run, we expect to automate and simplify large parts of the modernization process. To that end, we are leveraging the learnings from early service engagement to develop new tools to accelerate future modernization efforts. Although it's early days and scaling our legacy app modernization capabilities will take time, we have increased conviction that this motion will significantly add to our growth in the long term. Third, we are investing to capitalize on our inherent technical advantages as a key component of the emerging AI tech stack. As a reminder, MongoDB is uniquely equipped to query rich and complex data structures typical of AI applications. The ability of a database to query rich and complex data structures is crucial because AI applications often rely on highly detailed, interrelated, and nuanced data to make accurate predictions and decisions. For example, a recommendation system doesn't just analyze a single customer's purchase but also considers their browsing history, peer group behavior, and product categories requiring a database that can query and interlink these complex data structures. In addition, MongoDB's architecture unifies source data, metadata, operational data, and vector data in an all-in-one platform, updating the need for multiple database systems and complex back-end architectures. This enables a more compelling developer experience than any other alternative. From what we see in the AI market today, most customers are still in the experimental stage as they work to understand the effectiveness of the underlying tech stack and build early proof-of-concept applications. However, we are seeing an increasing number of AI apps in production. Today, we have thousands of AI apps on our platform. What we don't yet see is many of these apps actually achieving meaningful product market fit and therefore significant traction. In fact, as you take a step back and look at the entire universe of AI apps, a very small percentage of them have achieved the type of scale that we commonly see with enterprise-specific applications. We do have some AI apps that are growing quickly, including one that is already a seven-figure workload that has grown 10 times since the beginning of the year. Similar to prior platform shifts as the usefulness of AI tech improves and becomes more cost-effective, we will see the emergence of many more AI apps that do nail product market fit, but it's difficult to predict when that will happen more broadly. We remain confident that we will capture our fair share of these successful AI applications as we see that our platform is popular with developers building more sophisticated AI use cases. We continue investing in our product capabilities, including enterprise-grade Atlas Vector Search functionality to build on this momentum and even better position MongoDB to capture the AI opportunity. In addition, as previously announced, we are bringing search and vector service to our community and EA offerings, leveraging our run anywhere competitive advantage in the world of AI. Finally, we are expanding our MongoDB AI applications program or MAAP, which helps enterprise customers build and bring AI applications into production by providing them with reference architectures, integrations with leading tech providers, and coordinated services and support. Last week, we announced a new code of partners including McKinsey, Confluent, Capgemini, and Unstructured, as well as the collaboration with Meta to enable developers to build AI-enriched applications on MongoDB using Llama. Next, I'd like to provide you with a brief product update. At our dot local developer conference in London in October, we announced the general availability of MongoDB 8.0, the fastest and most performant version of MongoDB ever. MongoDB 8.0 performs 20% to 60% better against common industry benchmarks compared to our prior version and is built to exceed our customers' most stringent security, resiliency, availability, and performance requirements. To best serve our customers, we regularly review and reprioritize investments in our product portfolio to ensure we're allocating our resources to products with the highest demand from our customers. And to do that, we also deprecate products that are not showing results we desired. Consequently, we made the decision to consolidate our Atlas serverless offerings with our smallest dedicated tiers to create Atlas Flex customers, a new offering with a simpler architecture that provides the elasticity features akin to serverless. We will begin migrating effective customers to the single, simple, entry-level solution in Q4. We also decided to deprecate Atlas DeviceSync and other capabilities not widely adopted in order to focus our engineering resources on the core platform. While these reprioritization decisions are not made lightly, they allow us to deliver the most value to the largest number of customers, reinforcing our commitment to being the best modern database and helping us to grow faster. Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the adoption trends of MongoDB across our customer base. Customers across industries and around the world are running mission-critical projects in MongoDB Atlas, leveraging the full power of our developer data platform, including Financial Times, CarGurus, and Victoria's Secret. As part of the digital transformation journey, global specialty retailer Victoria's Secret & Company migrated its e-commerce platform to MongoDB Atlas. As a fully managed platform, MongoDB Atlas allowed the company to simplify its architecture and improve performance, supporting the retailer to provide a resilient, secure, and fast web and mobile e-commerce experience for their millions of customers around the world. Allianz, Alphamad, Swiss Post, and Paylocity are turning to MongoDB to modernize applications. Paylocity, a leading provider of cloud-based payroll and human capital management software, selected MongoDB to power proprietary application aimed at fostering employee connections and engagement. When traffic increased and the original SQL-based solution was unable to keep up with the required performance metrics, Paylocity migrated to MongoDB Atlas to take advantage of the flexible schema architecture, performance, and scalability. MongoDB costs five times less than the previous SQL database solution and the company's developers can now create an application within minutes, something that used to take weeks. Mature companies and start-ups alike are using MongoDB to help deliver the next wave of AI-powered application to customers, including NerdWallet, Cisco, and Tealbook. Tealbook, a supplier intelligence platform, migrated from Postgres, pgvector, and ElasticSearch to MongoDB to eliminate technical debt and consolidate their tech stack. The company experienced workload isolation and scalability issues in pgvector and were concerned with the search index inconsistencies, which were all resolved with the migration to MongoDB. With Atlas Vector search and dedicated search nodes, Tealbook has realized improved cost-efficiency and increased scalability for the supplier data platform, an application that uses GenAI to collect, verify, and enrich supplier data across various sources. In summary, we had a healthy Q3 with both Atlas and EA exceeding expectations. We saw a strong new business quarter and we remain confident in our ability to become an increasing strategic provider in our large and growing market. Looking forward, we see a great opportunity to grow our adoption in the enterprise through new workloads, modernizing legacy applications, and winning the next generation of AI-powered applications. I would like to finish by providing an update on our senior leadership. First, as we announced early in the press release, after nearly 10 years, Michael Gordon has made the decision to leave MongoDB. Michael has been instrumental in MongoDB's success over the past decade, leading our successful IPO, helping us grow our revenue nearly 50-fold, and scaling -- and successfully scaling our business model to generate meaningful operating leverage. He has been a trusted advisor and business partner to the Board and me over the years and also has become a personal friend. Michael is excited to take a well-deserved break. We have commenced the search for Michael's replacement and will be evaluating both internal and external candidates. One of Michael's proudest compliments -- accomplishments has been building a world-class finance team under his leadership, and I'm confident that we will not miss a beat during this transition. Michael will continue to serve as CFO through January 31st to help us finish the fiscal year and then will transition to an Advisor to the company to ensure a seamless process. If we have not named Michael's successor by fiscal year-end, Serge Tanjga, SVP of Finance, will serve as Interim CFO, beginning on February 1st. Second, we are promoting Cedric Pech, currently our chief revenue officer to the newly created role of president worldwide field operations. In this new position, Cedric will oversee all our field-based customer-facing and go-to-market enablement teams, including professional services. We believe this org structure will best enable us to execute on some of the key strategic initiatives I discussed earlier, in particular, our increased focus on up-market and the app monetization opportunity. I would like to congratulate Cedric on this well-deserved promotion. With that, let me turn the call over to Michael. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Dev, and thanks for the kind words and our incredible partnership over the past decade. The past 10 years have been the most rewarding in my professional career and I'm extremely proud of what we've achieved together and of course, to the whole MongoDB team. With as much success as we had, I still believe that MongoDB is in the early stages of realizing its full potential as it continues to take share in one of the largest markets in software. Now, turning to the results for the quarter. I'll begin with a detailed review of our third-quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025. First, I'll start with our third quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $529.4 million, up 22% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance. Shifting to our product mix, Atlas grew 26% in the quarter compared to the previous year and now represents 68% of total revenue compared to 66% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and 71% last quarter. We recognized Atlas revenue primarily based on customer consumption of our platform and that consumption is closely tied to end user activity of their applications. Let me provide some context on Atlas consumption in the quarter. In Q3, consumption was slightly ahead of our expectations. This year's Q3 seasonal improvement was more muted than in years past as expected. On a year-over-year basis, consumption growth remains below that of prior year period. Turning to non-Atlas revenue. Non-Atlas came in significantly ahead of our expectations. As Dev mentioned, EA new business was strong, and we continue to have success selling incremental workloads into our existing customer base. In addition, our Q3 non-Atlas revenue benefited from a few large multi-year deals. As you know, due to ASC 606, we recognized the entire term license component of a multi-year contract at the start of that contract. Compared to Q3 of last year, the multi-year license component of non-Atlas revenues was over $15 million higher. Turning to customer growth. During the third quarter, we grew our customer base by approximately 1,900 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 52,600, which is up from over 46,400 in the year-ago period. Of our total customer count, over 7,400 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 6,900 in the year-ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven primarily by Atlas, which had over 51,100 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 44,900 in the year-ago period. It is important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers adding their first Atlas workload. Continuing on, in Q3, our net ARR expansion rate was approximately 120%. We ended the quarter with 2,314 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, up from $1,972 in the year-ago period. Moving down the income statement, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the third quarter was $405.7 million, representing a gross margin of 77%, which is flat versus the year-ago period. Our income from operations was $101.5 million or 19% operating margin for the third quarter compared to an 18% operating margin in the year-ago period. The primary reason for more favorable operating income results versus guidance is our revenue outperformance, including the very high margin multi-year license revenue benefit. Net income in the third quarter was $98.1 million or $1.16 per share, based on 84.2 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a net income of $79.1 million or $0.96 per share on 83.7 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding in the year-ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the third quarter with $2.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $37.4 million. After taking into consideration approximately $2.9 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was $34.6 million in the quarter. This compares to free cash flow of $35 million in the year-ago period. In Q3, we did not incur capital expenditures to purchase IPV4 addresses as we previously expected, but we did start making those purchases in November and still expect a total outlay of $20 million to $25 million this fiscal year as we previously communicated. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $515 million to $519 million. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $55 million to $58 million and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.65 based on 84.9 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. For the full-fiscal year 2025, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.973 billion to $1.977 billion, non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $242 million to $245 million, and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $3.01 to $3.03 based on 84 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. Note that the non-GAAP net income per share guidance for the fourth-quarter and full-fiscal year 2025 includes a non-GAAP tax provision of approximately 20%. I'll now provide some more context around our updated guidance. First, in terms of Atlas consumption, we expect to see a typical seasonal slowdown in Q4, driven by underlying application usage moderating during the holiday season. Second, since Atlas consumption remained lower on a year-over-year basis in Q3, we expect to see continued deceleration of Atlas year-over-year growth in Q4. Third, we expect to see a sequential decline in non-Atlas revenue in Q4, which is contrary to our normal pattern. The reason for this is that we experienced a significant additional benefit from multi-year deals in Q3, which we do not expect to recur in Q4. In addition, I want to provide some incremental color on some of our recent product and -- how some of our recent product and go-to-market changes will impact the growth of our reported customer count going forward. First, as Dev explained, we are reallocating a portion of our go-to-market resources from the mid-market to the enterprise channel. As a result, we expect to see significantly fewer mid-market direct sales customer net additions and as a result, slower direct sales customer growth going forward. We believe this reallocation of investment dollars will drive higher revenue growth over time. So, it's a trade-off that makes sense. Second, as we introduce Atlas Flex clusters in Q4 and automatically migrate customers in Q1, we expect to see a one-time negative impact to our customer count since we have approximately 4,000 serverless customers who are very low spending and we do not expect them to transition over to Flex. These customers have a negligible impact on our revenue but will impact our reported customer count. To summarize, we're pleased with our third quarter results and especially our ability to win new business. We have a small share in one of the largest and fastest-growing markets in all of software with a number of secular tailwinds, including AI at our back. We'll continue investing judiciously and focusing on our execution to capture this long-term opportunity. With that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator? Questions & Answers: Operator [Operator instructions] Our first question for the day will be coming from Sanjit Singh of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Thank you for taking the questions and congrats, Michael, on outstanding career. You had an absolutely fantastic run at MongoDB. I'm excited to see what you do next, or excited if you just take a breather. So congrats, Michael. I guess to take the question -- to start off with the questions, when we look at what Atlas has been doing in the past two quarters, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think consumption is coming in at least modestly ahead of your expectations. Relative to what we've seen at the beginning of the year, what sort of -- is it a function of sales execution? Is it a function of the end-user activity sort of improving? What's driving at least the improvement in Atlas consumption in the past two quarters? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So a few different things. So I think if you look at our outlook at the beginning of the year, we had indicated that we thought we would see stable Atlas growth from a consumption standpoint. What we've seen and what we've talked about is -- we've actually seen lower year-over-year growth based on the underlying consumption. And so -- and that's incorporated into our Q4 guide. We have seen the Q3 and Q4 be -- sorry, Q2 and Q3, excuse me, be better than our expectations, but it's still down on a year-over-year basis. And so I want to make sure that we're not sort of confusing the comparative set of year-over-year versus relative to our expectations. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Understood. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer And the core of it, Sanjit, to your question is really the underlying usage of the applications. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Yeah, that makes total sense. And then, Dev, I have to ask you the AI agent question. In terms of an AI agent needing more context, it has going to have a set of tools to take its actions. What does it mean for MongoDB as an operational data store as customers start to roll out more agentic applications? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, just to talk about agents, I think when you think about agents, there's jobs, there's -- sorry, there's a job, there's projects and then there's task. Right now, the agents that are being rolled out are really focused on task like say something from Sierra or some other companies are rolling out agents. But you're right, what they deemed to do is to deal with being able to create a rich and complex data structures. Now why is this important for AI is that AI models don't just look at isolated data points, but they need to understand relationships, hierarchies, and patterns within the data. They need to be able to essentially get real-time insights. For example, if you have a chatbot where someone is querying, a customer is kind of trying to get some update on the order they placed five minutes ago because they may have not gotten any confirmation, your chatbot needs to be able to deal with real-time information. You need to be able to deal with basically handling very advanced use cases, understanding like, to do things like fraud detection to understand behaviors of supply chains, you need to understand intricate data relationships. All these things are consistent with MongoDB offers. And so we believe that at the end of the day, we are well-positioned to handle this. And the other thing that I would say is that we've embedded in a very natural way of search and vector search. So we're just not an OLTP database, we do tech search and vector search. That's all one experience and no other platform offers that, and we think we have a real advantage. And so we're integrated with the leading AI frameworks and platforms. We have enterprise-grade security and compliance, and customers can run us anywhere, either on 118 cloud regions or on-prem, and that again is a huge differentiator for us. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Awesome. Appreciate the thoughts, Dev. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Sanjit. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Taylor -- Tyler Radke of Citi. Your line is open. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Hi, thank you very much for taking the question. And, Michael, all the best, and congratulations on 10 years. Going back to the sales execution, I mean, one of the things that you talked about earlier this year was some challenges just in terms of the recently acquired workloads ramping. And I think a lot of those were from the past fiscal year. So curious how the quality of workload acquisition has trended this year. And as you think about the ramp in consumption potential into next year, how does that sort of look versus this time a year ago? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Maybe I'll just talk about what we're doing and the changes we made and then Michael can talk a little bit about the consumption trends. So, we did make some changes at the beginning of the year, and we really wanted to focus on both the volume and the quality of the workloads and there were some slight adjustments that we made. We think those changes are having a reasonable positive impact. Again, it's too early to declare victory because these workloads usually start small and grow over time, but we're really pleased with the results we're seeing so far. And -- but again, it's early days. And obviously, we'll know about the fiscal '25 workloads as we go into fiscal '26. But so far, so good. Michael, on consumption? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, just a couple of things, and thanks, Tyler. The fiscal '24 cohorts that we called out earlier, that slower growth does continue. They've been in line with our revised expectations. We made some changes that we talked about at the -- earlier in the year that should affect the fiscal '25 cohorts, but it's just too early to tell. On those, we need a few more quarters of data before you can really see if we're -- how we're seeing those behave differently. I will say we've talked about the new business environment and our success in new business. We have been pleased with that, but that just shows kind of the initial piece, and we need to see how they grow and how those cohorts evolve. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Great. Thanks. And follow-up on the EA side, you talked about the outsized strength in non-Atlas business this quarter. Maybe if you could unpack like the relative upside that was driven by simply duration versus new business. I know you called out the duration impact year-over-year, but are -- do you feel like this was sort of a one-off or do you feel like maybe some of your bigger customers are indexing more toward EA and how does that impact the way you think about the product and introducing things like vector search and stream processing onto the on-prem product? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, thank you. So overall, we continue to find the EA product resonate with customers. It's an important part of the run anywhere strategy and we've continued to see success with that and people wanting to increase their investment in MongoDB. There's always been a multiyear component and we continue to see that. We talked about that at the beginning of the year as to how fiscal '24 had an abnormally high amount of multi-year benefit and therefore, we were anticipating that being a headwind and we quantified that in roughly the $40 million range. What we talked about on this call earlier is we saw from a few large accounts, a surprising amount of multiyear that positively benefited Q3 at a little more than $15 million in revenue compared to what we saw Q3 a year ago. So, not as much of a headwind as we had been expecting. Obviously, with the 606 dynamics, some of these things, especially for a large deal can be kind of meaty and chunky and lumpy, which is why we try and call it out and sort of help people understand, but there's a pretty healthy kind of baseline flow, not just of EA, but also of multiyear. And when we see spikes, we just try and call it out for you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I just want to add, Tyler, that we are investing in our what we call our EA business. First, we're starting by investing with search and vector search and a community product. That does a couple of things for us. One, whenever anyone starts with MongoDB with the open-source product, they immediately get all the benefits of that complete highly integrated platform. Two, those capabilities will then migrate to EA. So, EA for us is an investment strategy. We definitely see lots of large customers who are very, very committed to running workloads on-prem. We even see some customers want to run to run AI workloads on-prem. So, the optionality they get by using MongoDB to not just be on-prem and the cloud, but also cross-cloud is a very compelling one. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Brad Reback of Stifel. Your line is open. Brad Reback -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. And, Michael, best of luck. It's been a great run. Dev, you started the call talking about a bunch of investments, which are great given the growth of the business. And obviously, you talked about reallocating some expenses. But net-net, should we think about this incremental investment phase next year as gating margin upside? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think that's something that we obviously are not ready to talk about next year just now, but I would say that we -- the reason we're looking to invest and just to summarize again, going up-market on legacy app modernization where we see very large workloads potentially at play and being the ideal database for GenAI apps, which is the future as important investments to drive long-term growth. And we're quite energized by those investments and that's something that we have high conviction on. Brad Reback -- Analyst That's great. And then on the MAAP program, are most of those workloads going to wind up in Atlas or will that be a healthy combination of EA and Atlas? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think it's again early days. I would say -- I would probably say more on the side of Atlas and EA in the early days. I think once we introduce a search and vector search into the EA product, you'll see more of that on-prem. Obviously, people can use MongoDB for AI workloads using other technologies as well in conjunction with MongoDB for on-prem AI use cases. But I would say you're probably going to see that happen first in Atlas. Brad Reback -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Jason Ader of William Blair. Your line is open. Jason Ader -- Analyst Yeah, thank you. I'm not going to belabor congratulating Michael, but it has been it has been fun working with you and best of luck. The question I had is on the strength in EA. Do you think, Dev, it represents a comment on how enterprises might be rethinking or reassessing the kind of on-prem versus cloud workload placement decision? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Well, when I think about large enterprises, I think large enterprises have meaningful workloads that are still running on-prem. I think the belief that everything would go to the cloud was probably something that was really popular in the good old days of Zurp. But I think now as customers assess their investments that they already have in place, they're being much more judicious about where they run those workloads and if they think they can leverage their existing investments in their own infrastructure, then they're going to do so. Also for a bunch of other reasons like regulatory reasons, some customers are quite not moving as aggressively to the cloud. We see that in particularly in Europe, where we see a lot of the European banks still running majority of the workloads on-prem. So it also varies by region where conversely in Asia, we're seeing people much move much more aggressively to the cloud. So I think it really depends on industry, on geography, and on the personal dynamics of what's happening in that particular account. I mean, we see some large US banks are also very committed to running things on-prem. So it really varies. And that's why we feel really good about our run anywhere strategy because it gives customer optionality. They can build something and run on-prem. And if and when they choose to move to the cloud, it's very easy to do so with MongoDB. Jason Ader -- Analyst All right. And then just as a follow-up also on the investments you're making in strategic sales and enterprise. Could you just get a little more specific on what those investments might be? Is it hiring a lot of new salespeople? Is it working more with SIs, investing more in SIs? Any additional detail would be helpful. Thanks. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So just for everyone's benefit, we've identified a number of accounts, which we call strategic accounts, which we think that have high upside for us. We've seen a number of accounts that grow very quickly when we deploy the right mix of resources. Now they're all not necessarily quota-carrying resources. They could be additional technical sales resources, additional PS resources, additional customer service resources to better service and support those accounts. We even do things like run education sessions for developers of the accounts, they're called either hackathons or like what we call developer days or even design reviews where we'll meet with our development teams who are looking to build an application, help them think about how they would potentially use MongoDB to build that particular app. And what we find is that because many of these developers, the experience with MongoDB is quite limited, the more we can engage with them, the more we can educate them and the more we can show them how simple and easy it is. Like for example, most customers today think like they have to use an OLTP database, then a search database, maybe a vector database, and then like a caching database. And all that is integrated in MongoDB. So all of a sudden, customers can say, wow, I can simplify my life, simplify my back-end infrastructure, build this app far more quickly and it will be much more easier to manage long-term if I do everything on MongoDB. And it's really a function of just educating them on the power of MongoDB that really opens up a lot of opportunities for us. So that's why we're doubling down, and the mix of resources is really predicated on the accounts, but it's not just quota counting resources, it's the whole suite of resources that we're bringing to the table. Jason Ader -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Andrew Nowinski of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Okay. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking the question and congrats on a nice quarter. You gave an example of a customer that migrated off Postgres and I think you said they had issues with their PG vector function. I was wondering how long was that customer using Postgres before they decided to make a change to Mongo, meaning was this some sort of like a rebound type customer where they chose PG -- or excuse me, Postgres and it didn't work? And then how frequently are you seeing this type of transition? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So I can't give you the specifics on how long they were using Postgres, but this is not -- this is a trend that we're seeing in our business. You have to remember Postgres is a 40-year-old technology. It's -- and they have been the beneficiary of people lifting and shifting from other types of relational databases, Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, et cetera. And they're an open-source database. And but as part -- because they're an open-source and relational database, they have the same inherent challenges all relational databases do. They're quite inflexible. So once you build a schema, it's very hard to change the schema. It's hard to scale and hard to distribute data. And if you have large data volumes, you have to do weird things like, for example, resort to off-road storage for large data objects, which creates performance bottlenecks. And so again, people default to Postgres if they don't know anything better because all they know is relational and everyone is kind of moving off those other relational platforms. And that's the whole point I was saying earlier. Once we educate developers on the flexibility of schema, how easily or horizontally scale the rich query language where you can do aggregations and do sophisticated geospatial indexes, the productivity gains by using the document model and how easy is to organize data, it's -- people are just like, wow, life is so much easier. Now I want to be clear, this is not a zero-sum game. Postgres does not have to fail for us to be successful. It's a big market and we're quite excited about the opportunity, but we do see customers moving off Postgres and coming to MongoDB. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Thank you. That was very helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up. If we normalize the $15 million multiyear deal impact you had in Q3, would EA still be down sequentially in Q4? Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer We haven't given that level of guidance, but just trying to help you understand in the context of the full-year numbers and the headwind that we talked about at the beginning of the year, just given the strength that we saw in Q3. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Got it. Thanks. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. The next question will be coming from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst Hey, thank you. And if you think about the EA strength this quarter, Michael, you'd kind of give us a little bit there. Like how should we think about renewal -- the renewal situation renewal pool coming up like or that you had in Q3, coming up in Q4, et cetera, as well and then like what does it mean in terms of upsell, cross-sell opportunity as people think about starting AI projects by self-serve, as you kind of mentioned earlier on the call? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So I think about -- if you think about EA for Q4, it tends to be a large renewal quarter, but what we're talking about in terms of the guide is because we had such strength in multiyear, that's where we would expect to see our EA down sequentially, which is not typically our pattern, which is why we called it out. In terms of AI workloads and some of those other things, I think it's early to tell and obviously, we'll continue to evolve and assess our view when we get to the full-year guide in March. And then we'll also have an updated view on how the cohorts are behaving and sort of how multiyear played out. But I think in terms of Q4, the comments that I made earlier hopefully will help. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst Yeah. Okay, perfect. And then the -- and can you talk a little bit about like obviously, there's a debate of like which database will be the persistent layer if you do AI projects, et cetera. What do you see from the big hyperscalers in terms of working with you guys and partnerships? We obviously just have AWS kind of summit, et-cetera. Can you speak a little bit like how your relationship with those big guys is evolving around this? And Michael, All the best in case I don't talk to you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, I'll start with the partnerships first, like our -- with AWS, as you said, they just had their re:Invent show last week. Our -- it remains very, very strong. We've closed a ton of deals this past quarter. Some of them very, very large deals. We're doing integrations to some of the new products like Q and Bedrock and the engagement in the field has been really strong. On Azure, I think we -- as I've shared in the past, we start-off with a little bit of a slow start, but in the words of the person who runs their partner leadership, the Azure MongoDB relationship has never been stronger. We've closed a large number of deals. We're part of what's called the Azure native IC service program and have a bunch of deep integrations with Azure, including Fabric, Power BI, Visual Studio, Semantic Kernel, and Azure OpenAI Studio. And we're also one of Azure's largest marketplace partners. And GCP does -- we have actually seen some uptick in terms of co-sales that we've done this past quarter and GCP made some comp changes where they -- that were favorable to working with MongoDB that we saw some results in the field, and we're focused on closing on -- closing a handful of large deals with GCP in Q4. So in general, I would say, things are going quite well. And then in terms of, I guess, implying your question was like the hyperscalers and are they potentially bundling things along with their AI offerings? I mean, candidly, since day one, the hyperscalers have been bundling their database offerings with every offering that they have and that's been their predominant strategy. And we've -- I think we've executed well against strategy because databases are not like a by-the-way decision. It's an important decision. And I think the hyperscalers are seeing our performance and realize it's better to partner with us. And as I said, customers understand the importance of the data layer, especially for AI applications. And so the partnership across all three hyperscalers is strong. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst OK, perfect. Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Raimo. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. The next question will be coming from the line of Brad Sills of Bank of America. Your line is open. Brad Sills -- Analyst Great. Thank you so much, and congratulations, Michael, on your next move. I wanted to ask about new workloads here on vector search, stream processing, relational migrator. Is there any one of those three that's ramping faster than maybe you expected? Just a little bit of color on how those new workload types are ramping. Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I'll kind of give you just a rundown of some of the -- I mean, essentially you're asking about the new products, like our -- on search, we introduced a new capability called Atlas search nodes, which where you can asymmetrically scale your search nodes because if you have a search-intensive use case, you don't have to scale all your nodes because they have become quite expensive. And we've seen that this kind of groundbreaking capability really well received. The demand is quite high and because customers like they can tune the configuration to the unique needs of their search requirements. One of the world's largest banks is using Atlas Search to provide like a Google-like search experience on payments data for massive corporate customers. So this is a customer-facing application and so performance, and scalability are critical. A leading provider of AI-powered accounting software uses Atlas Search to power its invoice analytics future, which allows end users and finance teams to perform ad-hoc analysis and easily find past-due invoices and voices that contain errors. So that search -- on vector search, it -- again, and it's been our kind of our first full-year since going generally available. And the product uptake has been actually very, very high. In Q3, we released quantization for Atlas Vector Search, which reduces the memory requirements by up to 96%, allowing us to support larger vector workloads with vastly improved price performance. For example, a multinational news organization created a GenAI powered tool designed to help producers and journalists efficiently search, summarize, and verify information from vast and varied data sources. A leading security firm is using Atlas Vector Search to fight AI fraud and a leading global media company replaced elastic search with hybrid search and vector search use case for a user recommendation engine that's built to suggest -- that's built in to suggest articles to end users. And so that's super exciting to see as well. We're also seeing a lot of interest in our streaming product, demand is very high. We just rolled it out to another hyperscaler, and customers are commenting on that the use cases of being able to embed stream processing with MongoDB makes our life so much easier. So overall, we're quite pleased with the progress we're making on the new products. And as I said before, natively bundling all these capabilities really reduces or eliminates the need for customers to have to bolt on a bunch of different technologies to solve the same problem, saving them a lot of time, money, cost, and risk. Brad Sills -- Analyst That's really exciting. Thanks, Dev. And then I wanted to ask a question around Cedric's appointment. Any focus that may be different here under his leadership that we should be thinking about going forward? Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer No, Cedric has been our CRO for, gosh, now like I think like five, six years, and he -- I was the Interim CRO for about three quarters until he took over when we last made a change and this is really an expansion of his responsibilities. I've known Cedric for a long time. He and I have worked with at multiple different companies. I think I have a good barometer for understanding sales leadership. There's a number of sales leaders who worked at other top-tier software companies who used to work for me or with me. And so I'm super-excited by the role Cedric is going to take and then we're also making some changes under Cedric to better align the different organizations so that we can more tightly work together on going up-market, on app monetization and positioning ourselves well to be the ideal database for GenAI apps. Brad Sills -- Analyst Super exciting. Thanks, Dev. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Brad. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question, please. Our next question will be coming from the line of Mike Cikos of Needham and Company. Your line is open. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Hey guys, thanks for taking the question here. I just wanted to come back to the consumption growth being slightly better than expectations again for the second quarter in a row now. And apologies if I missed it, but this improvement that we're seeing, is this across all vintages and geographies or is it potentially more concentrated in scope? Just trying to get a better understanding of what's seeking place out there and what's embedded in the guide. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. No, I would describe it as broad-based, Mike. And obviously, we're pleased to see it and we're continuing monitoring and slicing and dicing it in different ways. And as we have information or insights to you, we'll share it. And without trying to throw a whole bunch of cold water on our mind, it was slightly better, or a step-function changed better, but good to see. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Terrific. And maybe for a quick follow-up for Dev. I think it builds off maybe Tyler's question at the top of the Q&A, but you had cited that some customers are thinking about their workloads more holistically and even looking to run AI workloads on-prem. How much of that do you think is just a function of customers are still trying to figure out how to optimize for latency and cost or is this more a demonstration of we really are in the early phases of the exploratory phase versus going into production? Is there any way to coarse that out or is the two not necessarily connected? Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer No, I think it's kind of a little bit of both. I think you have some customers who are very committed to running a big part of the estate on-prem. So by definition, then if they're going to build an AI workload, it has to be run on-prem, which means that they also need access to GPUs and they're doing that. And then other customers are leveraging basically renting GPUs from the cloud providers and building their own AI workloads. I do think we're in the very, very early days. They're still learning, experimenting. More-and-more apps are entering production. And as I said on the prepared remarks, we have thousands of workload -- AI workloads running on MongoDB, but a very small percentage of them have demonstrated meaningful product market fit. And so the initial traction is kind of still small. But I think as people get more sophisticated with AI, as the AI technology matures and becomes more and more useful, I think applications will -- you'll start seeing these applications take-off. I kind of chuckled that today I see more senior leaders bragging about the chips they're using versus the apps they're building. So it just tells you that we're still in the very, very early days of this big platform shift. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Great point. Thank you again, guys. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Mike. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Eric Heath of KeyBanc. Your line is open. Eric Heath -- Analyst Hi, thanks for taking the question. Dev, Michael, it sounds like the takeaway from the call is a greater focus on EA and on enterprise. So should we structurally rethink the EA business differently and think of this more as a healthy double-digit growth business going forward for the foreseeable future? And then if I could just ask a follow-up question separate to that. But Michael, I understand that it's still early to identify the fiscal '25 cohort of workloads, but just curious at a high-level if they look and feel like of higher quality than the fiscal '24 cohort of workflow. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Do you want to take on the first one in terms of EA... Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, I mean, I would say, I mean, we are very committed to our run anywhere strategy. And as I said, we are first investing in community where for many customers is the first way they experience MongoDB. And we want them to have the full experience of integrating search and Vector search into our core product. And so they can out of the gate really start building applications. That will then transition to building those capabilities into EA. So, we are clearly investing in the EA product. But Atlas is still a big, big part of our business and a big, big part of our growth engine and we typically launch new features on Atlas and because of the capabilities we already have, the fact it's multi-cloud makes it a very, very compelling offering for many customers. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. And I think in terms of the workloads, I do think it's early. Just as a reminder for folks, they tend to start small, although grow quickly. I think the only other thing that I can add is, we've been pretty consistent and that we've been pleased with the new business that we've done. But we need some time to let the cohorts play out as we track them. But I think like I said, we've been happy with the new business that we were winning. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of William Power of Baird. Your line is open. Brian Raferty Denyeau -- Investor Relations You there, William? William Power -- Analyst Sorry, yeah. Thank you. Dev, you had some encouraging comments on relational migrator. I wonder if you could just touch on what you think is driving the higher interest here. I mean, it sounds like AI is contributing and helping, but it'd be great to get some more color there because that still feels like obviously a meaningful long-term opportunity. And then maybe the second part of the question for Dev or Michael, just be great to get any other framework around the professional services investments. Any way to kind of think about quantification and timing of that? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So the reason we're so excited about the opportunity to go after legacy applications is that, one, it seems like there's a confluence of events happening. One is that the increasing cost and tax of supporting and managing these legacy apps are just going up enough. Second, for many customers who are in regulated industries, the regulators are calling their -- the fact that they're running on these legacy apps with systemic risk, so they can no longer kick the can down the road. Third, also because they no longer can kick the can around, some vendors are going end-of-life, so they have to make a decision to migrate those applications to a more modern tech stack. Fourth, because GenAI is so predicated on data and to build a competitive advantage, you need to leverage your proprietary data, people want to access that data and be able to do so easily. And so that's another reason for them to want to modernize. And then you also have people who built those applications who are retiring or just no longer in the firm, so it just creates more and more risk for the companies. Given all that, customers are incredibly interested in figuring out a way to easily and safely and securely migrate those -- off those applications. And we always could help them very easily move the data and map the schema from a relational schema to a document schema. The hardest part was essentially rewriting the application. Now with the advent of GenAI, you can now significantly reduce the time. One, you can use GenAI to analyze existing code. Two, you can use GenAI to reverse engineer tests to test what the code does. And then three, you can use GenAI to build new code and then users test it to ensure that the new code produces the same results as the old code. And so all that time and effort is suddenly cut in a meaningful way and that's suddenly creating a lot of interest from customers saying, my goodness. And if you're already on a relational app, moving to another relational app doesn't feel like modernization. So, the other advantage is that moving to MongoDB gives them a much more modern platform, a much more agile, flexible, performant, and scalable platform for their future needs. And that's why we're so excited. Again, it's early days. We've run a number of pilots that have gone well. We're in the process of working with some customers now in the migration process. This will take time because these are very, very complex applications. And actually, one thing I also mentioned was that they're not just going after -- saying go after some tertiary Tier 2 or Tier 3 application, they're saying, hey, we want you to look at some of our crown jewels because these are the apps that are most painful for us. So that's also very exciting. But again, this will take time, but we're very committed to this, and we think this is going to drive -- help us drive long-term -- meaningful long-term growth. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, Will. And to the last part of your question on the professional services investment, we're really building out that capacity in order to meet the demand that we're seeing relative to the opportunity. We're calling it in particular because it has a gross margin impact because that's where that will typically show up. And then maybe the last thing and it's probably obvious, but just to sort of underscore it is the reason we're doing this though is for the ARR, right, to drive the new workloads, the additional workloads over to MongoDB as part of that migration. And over time, as we've talked about before, we hope and expect to be able to leverage technology more and more, but at least initially and into the medium-term, there's going to be a healthy human/services component to that. Just wanted to sort of effectively telegraph that out to folks. William Power -- Analyst That's helpful. Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Will. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Rudy Kessinger of DA Davidson. Please go ahead. Rudy Kessinger -- Analyst Hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in here. I believe last quarter you said consumption growth slightly ahead of expectations. And while down slower year-over-year growth versus Q2 last year, the year-over-year growth did improve from Q1. And so, I guess I'm curious for Q3, could you make a comment in that same regard? Obviously, slower on a year-over-year basis than Q3 last year, but was it stable with year-over-year consumption growth in Q2 or better or worse? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Rudy, thanks for the question. We haven't specifically called that out relative to Q2. We did see a lower year-over-year growth as we called out. We did see a seasonal rebound. Usually Q3 is stronger than Q2 and we talked about how that was smaller than in the prior year. So hopefully, that will help you all triangulate. Rudy Kessinger -- Analyst Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. I believe it was on your Q4 call back in March. At that point, Dev, you said it would be at least another year until AI applications are being deployed at scale. It sounds like the commentary that some early large workloads, but out of the thousands, just not many that are at large scale. I guess, is your expectation now that maybe it's still at least another year until we're seeing broad AI application rollouts at scale? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I think a lot of it's a function of the what's happening in the R&D side of AI, right? So for example, today, we don't have a very compelling model designed for our phones, right, because today the phones don't have the computing horsepower to run complex models. So, you don't see a ton of very, very successful consumer apps besides, say, ChatGPT or Claude. So we don't -- we also don't see like hundreds of apps taking off like you saw kind of the first generation of like the Internet or the cloud era, right, or the mobile era. So like I think we're still in the early days of AI. And so while we see a lot of people building AI apps, a lot of them have kind of fairly rudimentary functionality. But I think that over time that's going to change. In fact, I know it will change. I just can't predict when that will happen. But where we do see apps having production, we are having traction, we're seeing them grow very, very quickly and we have a lot of them on our platform. It's just very few of them are really have meaningful. Operator Thank you. And that concludes today's Q&A session. I would like to go ahead and turn the call back over to Dev for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, everyone. I just wanted to say we're really pleased with our Q3 results with strong new business performance and revenue exceeding expectations both -- across both Atlas and EA. We're making the necessary investments to expand our enterprise channel where we see the largest opportunity to establish MongoDB as a standard and the strongest returns on our go-to-market investments. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the progress we're making on both accelerating legacy app modernization with AI as well as establishing ourselves as a standard of the emerging AI tech stack for greenfield AI applications. And last but not least, I would like to thank Michael again for his contributions over the past 10 years and wish him well. Thank you, everyone, and we'll talk to you soon.

congratulate cedric well-deserved promotion. that, let turn call michael. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer thanks, dev, thanks kind word incredible partnership past decade. past 10 year rewarding professional career extremely proud achieved together course, whole mongodb team. much success had, still believe mongodb early stage realizing full potential continues take share one largest market software. now, turning result quarter. begin detailed review third-quarter result finish outlook fourth quarter full fiscal year 2025. first, start third quarter results. total revenue quarter $529.4 million, 22% year-over-year high end guidance. shifting product mix, atlas grew 26% quarter compared previous year represents 68% total revenue compared 66% third quarter fiscal 2024 71% last quarter. recognized atlas revenue primarily based customer consumption platform consumption closely tied end user activity applications. let provide context atlas consumption quarter. q3, consumption slightly ahead expectations. year's q3 seasonal improvement muted year past expected. year-over-year basis, consumption growth remains prior year period. turning non-atlas revenue. non-atlas came significantly ahead expectations. dev mentioned, ea new business strong, continue success selling incremental workload existing customer base. addition, q3 non-atlas revenue benefited large multi-year deals. know, due asc 606, recognized entire term license component multi-year contract start contract. compared q3 last year, multi-year license component non-atlas revenue $15 million higher. turning customer growth. third quarter, grew customer base approximately 1,900 customer sequentially, bringing total customer count 52,600, 46,400 year-ago period. total customer count, 7,400 direct sale customers, compare 6,900 year-ago period. growth total customer count driven primarily atlas, 51,100 customer end quarter compared 44,900 year-ago period. important keep mind growth atlas customer count reflects new customer mongodb addition existing ea customer adding first atlas workload. continuing on, q3, net arr expansion rate approximately 120%. ended quarter 2,314 customer least $100,000 arr annualized mrr, $1,972 year-ago period. moving income statement, discussing result non-gaap basis unless otherwise noted. gross profit third quarter $405.7 million, representing gross margin 77%, flat versus year-ago period. income operation $101.5 million 19% operating margin third quarter compared 18% operating margin year-ago period. primary reason favorable

ended third quarter $2.3 billion cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash. operating cash flow third quarter $37.4 million. taking consideration approximately $2.9 million capital expenditure principal repayment finance lease liabilities, free cash flow $34.6 million quarter. compare free cash flow $35 million year-ago period. q3, incur capital expenditure purchase ipv4 address previously expected, start making purchase november still expect total outlay $20 million $25 million fiscal year previously communicated. like turn outlook fourth quarter full fiscal year 2025. fourth quarter, expect revenue range $515 million $519 million. expect non-gaap income operation range $55 million $58 million non-gaap net income per share range $0.62 $0.65 based 84.9 million

income per share range $3.01 $3.03 based 84 million estimated diluted weighted-average share outstanding. note non-gaap net income per share guidance fourth-quarter full-fiscal year 2025 includes non-gaap tax provision approximately 20%. provide context around updated guidance. first, term atlas consumption, expect see typical seasonal slowdown q4, driven underlying application usage moderating holiday season. second, since atlas consumption remained lower year-over-year basis q3, expect see continued deceleration atlas year-over-year growth q4. third, expect see sequential decline non-atlas revenue q4, contrary normal pattern. reason experienced significant additional benefit multi-year deal q3, expect recur q4. addition, want provide incremental color recent product -- recent product go-to-market change impact growth reported customer count going forward. first, dev explained, reallocating portion go-to-market resource mid-market enterprise channel. result, expect see significantly fewer mid-market direct sale customer net addition result, slower direct sale customer growth going forward. believe reallocation investment dollar drive higher revenue growth time. so, trade-off make sense. second, introduce atlas flex cluster q4 automatically migrate customer q1, expect see one-time negative impact customer count since approximately 4,000 serverless customer low spending expect transition flex. customer negligible impact revenue impact reported customer count. summarize, pleased third quarter result especially ability win new business. small share one largest fastest-growing market software number secular tailwinds, including ai back. continue investing judiciously focusing execution capture long-term opportunity. that, like open questions. operator? question & answers: operator [operator instructions] first question day coming sanjit singh morgan stanley. line open. sanjit singh -- analyst thank taking question congrats, michael, outstanding career. absolutely fantastic run mongodb. excited see next, excited take breather. congrats, michael. guess take question -- start questions, look atlas past two quarters, correct wrong, think consumption coming least modestly ahead expectations. relative seen beginning year, sort -- function sale execution? function end-user activity sort improving? what's driving least improvement atlas consumption past two quarters? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. different things. think look outlook beginning year, indicated thought would see stable atlas growth consumption standpoint. seen talked -- actually seen lower year-over-year growth based underlying consumption. -- that's incorporated q4 guide. seen q3 q4 -- sorry, q2 q3, excuse me, better expectations, still year-over-year basis. want make sure sort confusing comparative set year-over-year versus relative expectations. sanjit singh -- analyst understood. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer core it, sanjit, question really underlying usage applications. sanjit singh -- analyst yeah, make total sense. then, dev, ask ai agent question. term ai agent needing context, going set tool take actions. mean mongodb operational data store customer start roll agentic applications? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. so, talk agents, think think agents, there's jobs, there's -- sorry, there's job, there's project there's task. right now, agent rolled really focused task like say something sierra company rolling agents. right, deemed deal able create rich complex data structures. important ai ai model look isolated data points, need understand relationships, hierarchies, pattern within data. need able essentially get real-time insights. example, chatbot someone querying, customer kind trying get update order placed five minute ago may gotten confirmation, chatbot need able deal real-time information. need able deal basically handling advanced use cases, understanding like, thing like fraud detection understand behavior supply chains, need understand intricate data relationships. thing consistent mongodb offers. believe end day, well-positioned handle this. thing would say embedded natural way search vector search. oltp database, tech search vector search. that's one experience platform offer that, think real advantage. integrated leading ai framework platforms. enterprise-grade security compliance, customer run u anywhere, either 118 cloud region on-prem, huge differentiator us. sanjit singh -- analyst awesome. appreciate thoughts, dev. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, sanjit. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line taylor -- tyler radke citi. line open. tyler radke -- analyst hi, thank much taking question. and, michael, best, congratulation 10 years. going back sale execution, mean, one thing talked earlier year challenge term recently acquired workload ramping. think lot past fiscal year. curious quality workload acquisition trended year. think ramp consumption potential next year, sort look versus time year ago? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. maybe talk change made michael talk little bit consumption trends. so, make change beginning year, really wanted focus volume quality workload slight adjustment made. think change reasonable positive impact. again, early declare victory workload usually start small grow time, really pleased result seeing far. -- again, early days. obviously, know fiscal '25 workload go fiscal '26. far, good. michael, consumption? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, couple things, thanks, tyler. fiscal '24 cohort called earlier, slower growth continue. line revised expectations. made change talked -- earlier year affect fiscal '25 cohorts, early tell. those, need quarter data really see -- seeing behave differently. say talked new business environment success new business. pleased that, show kind initial piece, need see grow cohort evolve. tyler radke -- analyst great. thanks. follow-up ea side, talked outsized strength non-atlas business quarter. maybe could unpack like relative upside driven simply duration versus new business. know called duration impact year-over-year, -- feel like sort one-off feel like maybe bigger customer indexing toward ea impact way think product introducing thing like vector search stream processing onto on-prem product? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah, thank you. overall, continue find ea product resonate customers. important part run anywhere strategy continued see success people wanting increase investment mongodb. there's always multiyear component continue see that. talked beginning year fiscal '24 abnormally high amount multi-year benefit therefore, anticipating headwind quantified roughly $40 million range. talked call earlier saw large accounts, surprising amount multiyear positively benefited q3 little $15 million revenue compared saw q3 year ago. so, much headwind expecting. obviously, 606 dynamics, things, especially large deal kind meaty chunky lumpy, try call sort help people understand, there's pretty healthy kind baseline flow, ea, also multiyear. see spikes, try call you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. want add, tyler, investing call ea business. first, starting investing search vector search community product. couple thing us. one, whenever anyone start mongodb open-source product, immediately get benefit complete highly integrated platform. two, capability migrate ea. so, ea u investment strategy. definitely see lot large customer very, committed running workload on-prem. even see customer want run run ai workload on-prem. so, optionality get using mongodb on-prem cloud, also cross-cloud compelling one. tyler radke -- analyst thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line brad reback stifel. line open. brad reback -- analyst great. thanks much. and, michael, best luck. great run. dev, started call talking bunch investments, great given growth business. obviously, talked reallocating expenses. net-net, think incremental investment phase next year gating margin upside? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer think that's something obviously ready talk next year now, would say -- reason looking invest summarize again, going up-market legacy app modernization see large workload potentially play ideal database genai apps, future important investment drive long-term growth. quite energized investment that's something high conviction on. brad reback -- analyst that's great. maap program, workload going wind atlas healthy combination ea atlas? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer think early days. would say -- would probably say side atlas ea early days. think introduce search vector search ea product, see on-prem. obviously, people use mongodb ai workload using technology well conjunction mongodb on-prem ai use cases. would say probably going see happen first atlas. brad reback -- analyst great. thanks much. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line jason ader william blair. line open. jason ader -- analyst yeah, thank you. going belabor congratulating michael, fun working best luck. question strength ea. think, dev, represents comment enterprise might rethinking reassessing kind on-prem versus cloud workload placement decision? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer well, think large enterprises, think large enterprise meaningful workload still running on-prem. think belief everything would go cloud probably something really popular good old day zurp. think customer assess investment already place, much judicious run workload think leverage existing investment infrastructure, going so. also bunch reason like regulatory reasons, customer quite moving aggressively cloud. see particularly europe, see lot european bank still running majority workload on-prem. also varies region conversely asia, seeing people much move much aggressively cloud. think really depends industry, geography, personal dynamic what's happening particular account. mean, see large u bank also committed running thing on-prem. really varies. that's feel really good run anywhere strategy give customer optionality. build something run on-prem. choose move cloud, easy mongodb. jason ader -- analyst right. follow-up also investment making strategic sale enterprise. could get little specific investment might be? hiring lot new salespeople? working sis, investing sis? additional detail would helpful. thanks. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. everyone's benefit, identified number accounts, call strategic accounts, think high upside us. seen number account grow quickly deploy right mix resources. necessarily quota-carrying resources. could additional technical sale resources, additional p resources, additional customer service resource better service support accounts. even thing like run education session developer accounts, called either hackathons like call developer day even design review meet development team looking build application, help think would potentially use mongodb build particular app. find many developers, experience mongodb quite limited, engage them, educate show simple easy is. like example, customer today think like use oltp database, search database, maybe vector database, like caching database. integrated mongodb. sudden, customer say, wow, simplify life, simplify back-end infrastructure, build app far quickly much easier manage long-term everything mongodb. really function educating power mongodb really open lot opportunity us. that's doubling down, mix resource really predicated accounts, quota counting resources, whole suite resource bringing table. jason ader -- analyst thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line andrew nowinski well fargo. line open. andrew nowinski -- analyst okay. good afternoon. thank much taking question congrats nice quarter. gave example customer migrated postgres think said issue pg vector function. wondering long customer using postgres decided make change mongo, meaning sort like rebound type customer chose pg -- excuse me, postgres work? frequently seeing type transition? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. can't give specific long using postgres, -- trend seeing business. remember postgres 40-year-old technology. -- beneficiary people lifting shifting type relational databases, oracle, sql server, mysql, et cetera. open-source database. part -- open-source relational database, inherent challenge relational database do. quite inflexible. build schema, hard change schema. hard scale hard distribute data. large data volumes, weird thing like, example, resort off-road storage large data objects, creates performance bottlenecks. again, people default postgres know anything better know relational everyone kind moving relational platforms. that's whole point saying earlier. educate developer flexibility schema, easily horizontally scale rich query language aggregation sophisticated geospatial indexes, productivity gain using document model easy organize data, -- people like, wow, life much easier. want clear, zero-sum game. postgres fail u successful. big market quite excited opportunity, see customer moving postgres coming mongodb. andrew nowinski -- analyst thank you. helpful. maybe quick follow-up. normalize $15 million multiyear deal impact q3, would ea still sequentially q4? thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer given level guidance, trying help understand context full-year number headwind talked beginning year, given strength saw q3. andrew nowinski -- analyst got it. thanks. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line raimo lenschow barclays. line open. raimo lenschow -- analyst hey, thank you. think ea strength quarter, michael, kind give u little bit there. like think renewal -- renewal situation renewal pool coming like q3, coming q4, et cetera, well like mean term upsell, cross-sell opportunity people think starting ai project self-serve, kind mentioned earlier call? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. think -- think ea q4, tends large renewal quarter, talking term guide strength multiyear, that's would expect see ea sequentially, typically pattern, called out. term ai workload things, think early tell obviously, continue evolve assess view get full-year guide march. also updated view cohort behaving sort multiyear played out. think term q4, comment made earlier hopefully help. raimo lenschow -- analyst yeah. okay, perfect. -- talk little bit like obviously, there's debate like database persistent layer ai projects, et cetera. see big hyperscalers term working guy partnerships? obviously aws kind summit, et-cetera. speak little bit like relationship big guy evolving around this? michael, best case talk you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. so, start partnership first, like -- aws, said, re:invent show last week. -- remains very, strong. closed ton deal past quarter. very, large deals. integration new product like q bedrock engagement field really strong. azure, think -- shared past, start-off little bit slow start, word person run partner leadership, azure mongodb relationship never stronger. closed large number deals. part what's called azure native ic service program bunch deep integration azure, including fabric, power bi, visual studio, semantic kernel, azure openai studio. also one azure's largest marketplace partners. gcp -- actually seen uptick term co-sales done past quarter gcp made comp change -- favorable working mongodb saw result field, focused closing -- closing handful large deal gcp q4. general, would say, thing going quite well. term of, guess, implying question like hyperscalers potentially bundling thing along ai offerings? mean, candidly, since day one, hyperscalers bundling database offering every offering that's predominant strategy. -- think executed well strategy database like by-the-way decision. important decision. think hyperscalers seeing performance realize better partner us. said, customer understand importance data layer, especially ai applications. partnership across three hyperscalers strong. raimo lenschow -- analyst ok, perfect. thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer thanks, raimo. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line brad sill bank america. line open. brad sill -- analyst great. thank much, congratulations, michael, next move. wanted ask new workload vector search, stream processing, relational migrator. one three that's ramping faster maybe expected? little bit color new workload type ramping. thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. kind give rundown -- mean, essentially asking new products, like -- search, introduced new capability called atlas search nodes, asymmetrically scale search node search-intensive use case, scale node become quite expensive. seen kind groundbreaking capability really well received. demand quite high customer like tune configuration unique need search requirements. one world's largest bank using atlas search provide like google-like search experience payment data massive corporate customers. customer-facing application performance, scalability critical. leading provider ai-powered accounting software us atlas search power invoice analytics future, allows end user finance team perform ad-hoc analysis easily find past-due invoice voice contain errors. search -- vector search, -- again, kind first full-year since going generally available. product uptake actually very, high. q3, released quantization atlas vector search, reduces memory requirement 96%, allowing u support larger vector workload vastly improved price performance. example, multinational news organization created genai powered tool designed help producer journalist efficiently search, summarize, verify information vast varied data sources. leading security firm using atlas vector search fight ai fraud leading global medium company replaced elastic search hybrid search vector search use case user recommendation engine that's built suggest -- that's built suggest article end users. that's super exciting see well. also seeing lot interest streaming product, demand high. rolled another hyperscaler, customer commenting use case able embed stream processing mongodb make life much easier. overall, quite pleased progress making new products. said before, natively bundling capability really reduces eliminates need customer bolt bunch different technology solve problem, saving lot time, money, cost, risk. brad sill -- analyst that's really exciting. thanks, dev. wanted ask question around cedric's appointment. focus may different leadership thinking going forward? thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer no, cedric cro for, gosh, like think like five, six years, -- interim cro three quarter took last made change really expansion responsibilities. known cedric long time. worked multiple different companies. think good barometer understanding sale leadership. there's number sale leader worked top-tier software company used work me. super-excited role cedric going take also making change cedric better align different organization tightly work together going up-market, app monetization positioning well ideal database genai apps. brad sill -- analyst super exciting. thanks, dev. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer thanks, brad. operator thank you. one moment next question, please. next question coming line mike cikos needham company. line open. mike cikos -- analyst hey guys, thanks taking question here. wanted come back consumption growth slightly better expectation second quarter row now. apology missed it, improvement seeing, across vintage geography potentially concentrated scope? trying get better understanding what's seeking place what's embedded guide. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. no, would describe broad-based, mike. obviously, pleased see continuing monitoring slicing dicing different ways. information insight you, share it. without trying throw whole bunch cold water mind, slightly better, step-function changed better, good see. mike cikos -- analyst terrific. maybe quick follow-up dev. think build maybe tyler's question top q&a, cited customer thinking workload holistically even looking run ai workload on-prem. much think function customer still trying figure optimize latency cost demonstration really early phase exploratory phase versus going production? way coarse two necessarily connected? thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer no, think kind little bit both. think customer committed running big part estate on-prem. definition, going build ai workload, run on-prem, mean also need access gpus that. customer leveraging basically renting gpus cloud provider building ai workloads. think very, early days. still learning, experimenting. more-and-more apps entering production. said prepared remarks, thousand workload -- ai workload running mongodb, small percentage demonstrated meaningful product market fit. initial traction kind still small. think people get sophisticated ai, ai technology matures becomes useful, think application -- start seeing application take-off. kind chuckled today see senior leader bragging chip using versus apps building. tell still very, early day big platform shift. mike cikos -- analyst great point. thank again, guys. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, mike. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line eric heath keybanc. line open. eric heath -- analyst hi, thanks taking question. dev, michael, sound like takeaway call greater focus ea enterprise. structurally rethink ea business differently think healthy double-digit growth business going forward foreseeable future? could ask follow-up question separate that. michael, understand still early identify fiscal '25 cohort workloads, curious high-level look feel like higher quality fiscal '24 cohort workflow. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer want take first one term ea... michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, mean, would say, mean, committed run anywhere strategy. said, first investing community many customer first way experience mongodb. want full experience integrating search vector search core product. gate really start building applications. transition building capability ea. so, clearly investing ea product. atlas still big, big part business big, big part growth engine typically launch new feature atlas capability already have, fact multi-cloud make very, compelling offering many customers. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. think term workloads, think early. reminder folks, tend start small, although grow quickly. think thing add is, pretty consistent pleased new business done. need time let cohort play track them. think like said, happy new business winning. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line william power baird. line open. brian raferty denyeau -- investor relation there, william? william power -- analyst sorry, yeah. thank you. dev, encouraging comment relational migrator. wonder could touch think driving higher interest here. mean, sound like ai contributing helping, great get color still feel like obviously meaningful long-term opportunity. maybe second part question dev michael, great get framework around professional service investments. way kind think quantification timing that? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. reason excited opportunity go legacy application that, one, seems like there's confluence event happening. one increasing cost tax supporting managing legacy apps going enough. second, many customer regulated industries, regulator calling -- fact running legacy apps systemic risk, longer kick road. third, also longer kick around, vendor going end-of-life, make decision migrate application modern tech stack. fourth, genai predicated data build competitive advantage, need leverage proprietary data, people want access data able easily. that's another reason want modernize. also people built application retiring longer firm, creates risk companies. given that, customer incredibly interested figuring way easily safely securely migrate -- applications. always could help easily move data map schema relational schema document schema. hardest part essentially rewriting application. advent genai, significantly reduce time. one, use genai analyze existing code. two, use genai reverse engineer test test code does. three, use genai build new code user test ensure new code produce result old code. time effort suddenly cut meaningful way that's suddenly creating lot interest customer saying, goodness. already relational app, moving another relational app feel like modernization. so, advantage moving mongodb give much modern platform, much agile, flexible, performant, scalable platform future needs. that's excited. again, early days. run number pilot gone well. process working customer migration process. take time very, complex applications. actually, one thing also mentioned going -- saying go tertiary tier 2 tier 3 application, saying, hey, want look crown jewel apps painful us. that's also exciting. again, take time, committed this, think going drive -- help u drive long-term -- meaningful long-term growth. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, will. last part question professional service investment, really building capacity order meet demand seeing relative opportunity. calling particular gross margin impact that's typically show up. maybe last thing probably obvious, sort underscore reason though arr, right, drive new workloads, additional workload mongodb part migration. time, talked before, hope expect able leverage technology more, least initially medium-term, there's going healthy human/services component that. wanted sort effectively telegraph folks. william power -- analyst that's helpful. thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, will. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line rudy kessinger da davidson. please go ahead. rudy kessinger -- analyst hey guys, thanks squeezing here. believe last quarter said consumption growth slightly ahead expectations. slower year-over-year growth versus q2 last year, year-over-year growth improve q1. so, guess curious q3, could make comment regard? obviously, slower year-over-year basis q3 last year, stable year-over-year consumption growth q2 better worse? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. rudy, thanks question. specifically called relative q2. see lower year-over-year growth called out. see seasonal rebound. usually q3 stronger q2 talked smaller prior year. hopefully, help triangulate. rudy kessinger -- analyst okay. quick follow-up. believe q4 call back march. point, dev, said would least another year ai application deployed scale. sound like commentary early large workloads, thousands, many large scale. guess, expectation maybe still least another year seeing broad ai application rollouts scale? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. think lot function what's happening r&d side ai, right? example, today, compelling model designed phones, right, today phone computing horsepower run complex models. so, see ton very, successful consumer apps besides, say, chatgpt claude. -- also see like hundred apps taking like saw kind first generation like internet cloud era, right, mobile era. like think still early day ai. see lot people building ai apps, lot kind fairly rudimentary functionality. think time that's going change. fact, know change. can't predict happen. see apps production, traction, seeing grow very, quickly lot platform. really meaningful. operator thank you. concludes today's q&a session. would like go ahead turn call back dev closing remarks. please go ahead. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thank you, everyone. wanted say really pleased q3 result strong new business performance revenue exceeding expectation -- across atlas ea. making necessary investment expand enterprise channel see largest opportunity establish mongodb standard strongest return go-to-market investments. looking ahead, encouraged progress making accelerating legacy app modernization ai well establishing standard emerging ai tech stack greenfield ai applications. last least, would like thank michael contribution past 10 year wish well. thank you, everyone, talk soon. operator [operator

Welcome to the MongoDB third-quarter fiscal year 2025 conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there'll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your speaker for today, Brian Denyeau. Please go ahead. Brian Raferty Denyeau -- Investor Relations Thank you, Lisa. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today to review MongoDB's third-quarter fiscal 2025 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued after the close of the market today. Joining me the call today are Dev Ittycheria, president and CEO of MongoDB; and Michael Gordon, MongoDB's COO and CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our market and future growth opportunities, our expectations for the macroeconomic environment in fiscal 2025 and the impact of AI, the benefits of our product platform, our competitive landscape, customer behaviors, our financial guidance, and our planned investments in growth opportunities in AI. These statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including the results of operations and financial condition that cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. For a discussion of the material risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please refer to the risks described in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 31st, 2024 that we filed with the SEC on August 30th, 2024. Any forward-looking statements made on this call reflect our views only as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them except as required by law. Additionally, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures on this conference call. Please refer to the tables in our earnings release in the Investor Relations portion of our website for a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dev. Dev? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we had a strong quarter of new business and executed well against our large market opportunity. Let's begin by reviewing our third quarter results before giving you a broader company update. We generated revenue of $529 million, a 22% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew 26% year-over-year, representing 68% of total revenue. We generated non-GAAP operating income of $101 million for a 19% non-GAAP operating margin and we ended the quarter with over 52,600 customers. Overall, we were pleased with our performance in the third quarter. We had a strong new business quarter and we're happy with our new workload acquisition on Atlas. Our non-Atlas business significantly exceeded expectations in part because we benefited from a few large multi-year deals as customers continue to value our run anywhere strategy and want to build a deeper longer-term relationship with MongoDB. Atlas consumption was slightly better than expected in a macro-environment that we would characterize as largely consistent with what we saw in the first half of the year. Michael will cover consumption trends in more detail. Retention rates remained strong in Q3, demonstrating the mission criticality of our platform. On our Q1 earnings call, we shared with you the three major strategic initiatives that we believe will enable us to maximize our long-term opportunity. I want to give you an update on the progress we're making on those initiatives. First, we are increasing our investment in the enterprise channel since we see the strongest returns in this part of the market. Specifically, we're expanding our strategic account program going to next year, as we see more accounts that will benefit from incremental investment. In addition, we're investing time and resources to educate developers in large enterprise accounts and uplevel their MongoDB skills. These organizations have thousands of developers and as we penetrate them more deeply, we encounter developers who have historically only built SQL applications and simply do not know how to use MongoDB to its full potential. In our experience, educating these developers on the benefits of MongoDB drives significant incremental adoption of our platform. To fund these up-market investments, we are reallocating a portion of our mid-market investments. The mid-market remains an attractive opportunity for us, but we believe that prioritizing investment up-market will deliver strong returns in the current environment. We also believe there are additional ways to serve the mid-market more efficiently through our self-serve channel and other scaled technology-enabled sales and customer service motions. Second, we are optimistic about the opportunity to accelerate legacy app modernization using AI and are investing more in this area. As you recall, we ran a few successful pilots earlier this year, demonstrating that AI tooling combined with professional services and our relational migrator product can significantly reduce the time, cost, and risk of migrating legacy applications onto MongoDB. While it's early days, we have observed a more than 50% reduction in the cost to modernize. On the back of these strong early results, additional customer interest is exceeding our expectations. Large enterprises in every industry and geography are experiencing acute pain from their legacy infrastructure and are eager for more agile, performant, and cost-effective solutions. Not only are customers excited to engage with us, they also want to focus on some of the most important applications in their enterprise, further demonstrating the level of interest and size of the long-term opportunity. As relational applications encompass a wide variety of database types, programming languages, versions, and other customer-specific variables, we expect modernization projects to continue to include meaningful service engagements in the short and medium term. Consequently, we're increasing our professional services delivery capabilities, both directly and through partners. In the long run, we expect to automate and simplify large parts of the modernization process. To that end, we are leveraging the learnings from early service engagement to develop new tools to accelerate future modernization efforts. Although it's early days and scaling our legacy app modernization capabilities will take time, we have increased conviction that this motion will significantly add to our growth in the long term. Third, we are investing to capitalize on our inherent technical advantages as a key component of the emerging AI tech stack. As a reminder, MongoDB is uniquely equipped to query rich and complex data structures typical of AI applications. The ability of a database to query rich and complex data structures is crucial because AI applications often rely on highly detailed, interrelated, and nuanced data to make accurate predictions and decisions. For example, a recommendation system doesn't just analyze a single customer's purchase but also considers their browsing history, peer group behavior, and product categories requiring a database that can query and interlink these complex data structures. In addition, MongoDB's architecture unifies source data, metadata, operational data, and vector data in an all-in-one platform, updating the need for multiple database systems and complex back-end architectures. This enables a more compelling developer experience than any other alternative. From what we see in the AI market today, most customers are still in the experimental stage as they work to understand the effectiveness of the underlying tech stack and build early proof-of-concept applications. However, we are seeing an increasing number of AI apps in production. Today, we have thousands of AI apps on our platform. What we don't yet see is many of these apps actually achieving meaningful product market fit and therefore significant traction. In fact, as you take a step back and look at the entire universe of AI apps, a very small percentage of them have achieved the type of scale that we commonly see with enterprise-specific applications. We do have some AI apps that are growing quickly, including one that is already a seven-figure workload that has grown 10 times since the beginning of the year. Similar to prior platform shifts as the usefulness of AI tech improves and becomes more cost-effective, we will see the emergence of many more AI apps that do nail product market fit, but it's difficult to predict when that will happen more broadly. We remain confident that we will capture our fair share of these successful AI applications as we see that our platform is popular with developers building more sophisticated AI use cases. We continue investing in our product capabilities, including enterprise-grade Atlas Vector Search functionality to build on this momentum and even better position MongoDB to capture the AI opportunity. In addition, as previously announced, we are bringing search and vector service to our community and EA offerings, leveraging our run anywhere competitive advantage in the world of AI. Finally, we are expanding our MongoDB AI applications program or MAAP, which helps enterprise customers build and bring AI applications into production by providing them with reference architectures, integrations with leading tech providers, and coordinated services and support. Last week, we announced a new code of partners including McKinsey, Confluent, Capgemini, and Unstructured, as well as the collaboration with Meta to enable developers to build AI-enriched applications on MongoDB using Llama. Next, I'd like to provide you with a brief product update. At our dot local developer conference in London in October, we announced the general availability of MongoDB 8.0, the fastest and most performant version of MongoDB ever. MongoDB 8.0 performs 20% to 60% better against common industry benchmarks compared to our prior version and is built to exceed our customers' most stringent security, resiliency, availability, and performance requirements. To best serve our customers, we regularly review and reprioritize investments in our product portfolio to ensure we're allocating our resources to products with the highest demand from our customers. And to do that, we also deprecate products that are not showing results we desired. Consequently, we made the decision to consolidate our Atlas serverless offerings with our smallest dedicated tiers to create Atlas Flex customers, a new offering with a simpler architecture that provides the elasticity features akin to serverless. We will begin migrating effective customers to the single, simple, entry-level solution in Q4. We also decided to deprecate Atlas DeviceSync and other capabilities not widely adopted in order to focus our engineering resources on the core platform. While these reprioritization decisions are not made lightly, they allow us to deliver the most value to the largest number of customers, reinforcing our commitment to being the best modern database and helping us to grow faster. Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the adoption trends of MongoDB across our customer base. Customers across industries and around the world are running mission-critical projects in MongoDB Atlas, leveraging the full power of our developer data platform, including Financial Times, CarGurus, and Victoria's Secret. As part of the digital transformation journey, global specialty retailer Victoria's Secret & Company migrated its e-commerce platform to MongoDB Atlas. As a fully managed platform, MongoDB Atlas allowed the company to simplify its architecture and improve performance, supporting the retailer to provide a resilient, secure, and fast web and mobile e-commerce experience for their millions of customers around the world. Allianz, Alphamad, Swiss Post, and Paylocity are turning to MongoDB to modernize applications. Paylocity, a leading provider of cloud-based payroll and human capital management software, selected MongoDB to power proprietary application aimed at fostering employee connections and engagement. When traffic increased and the original SQL-based solution was unable to keep up with the required performance metrics, Paylocity migrated to MongoDB Atlas to take advantage of the flexible schema architecture, performance, and scalability. MongoDB costs five times less than the previous SQL database solution and the company's developers can now create an application within minutes, something that used to take weeks. Mature companies and start-ups alike are using MongoDB to help deliver the next wave of AI-powered application to customers, including NerdWallet, Cisco, and Tealbook. Tealbook, a supplier intelligence platform, migrated from Postgres, pgvector, and ElasticSearch to MongoDB to eliminate technical debt and consolidate their tech stack. The company experienced workload isolation and scalability issues in pgvector and were concerned with the search index inconsistencies, which were all resolved with the migration to MongoDB. With Atlas Vector search and dedicated search nodes, Tealbook has realized improved cost-efficiency and increased scalability for the supplier data platform, an application that uses GenAI to collect, verify, and enrich supplier data across various sources. In summary, we had a healthy Q3 with both Atlas and EA exceeding expectations. We saw a strong new business quarter and we remain confident in our ability to become an increasing strategic provider in our large and growing market. Looking forward, we see a great opportunity to grow our adoption in the enterprise through new workloads, modernizing legacy applications, and winning the next generation of AI-powered applications. I would like to finish by providing an update on our senior leadership. First, as we announced early in the press release, after nearly 10 years, Michael Gordon has made the decision to leave MongoDB. Michael has been instrumental in MongoDB's success over the past decade, leading our successful IPO, helping us grow our revenue nearly 50-fold, and scaling -- and successfully scaling our business model to generate meaningful operating leverage. He has been a trusted advisor and business partner to the Board and me over the years and also has become a personal friend. Michael is excited to take a well-deserved break. We have commenced the search for Michael's replacement and will be evaluating both internal and external candidates. One of Michael's proudest compliments -- accomplishments has been building a world-class finance team under his leadership, and I'm confident that we will not miss a beat during this transition. Michael will continue to serve as CFO through January 31st to help us finish the fiscal year and then will transition to an Advisor to the company to ensure a seamless process. If we have not named Michael's successor by fiscal year-end, Serge Tanjga, SVP of Finance, will serve as Interim CFO, beginning on February 1st. Second, we are promoting Cedric Pech, currently our chief revenue officer to the newly created role of president worldwide field operations. In this new position, Cedric will oversee all our field-based customer-facing and go-to-market enablement teams, including professional services. We believe this org structure will best enable us to execute on some of the key strategic initiatives I discussed earlier, in particular, our increased focus on up-market and the app monetization opportunity. I would like to congratulate Cedric on this well-deserved promotion. With that, let me turn the call over to Michael. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Dev, and thanks for the kind words and our incredible partnership over the past decade. The past 10 years have been the most rewarding in my professional career and I'm extremely proud of what we've achieved together and of course, to the whole MongoDB team. With as much success as we had, I still believe that MongoDB is in the early stages of realizing its full potential as it continues to take share in one of the largest markets in software. Now, turning to the results for the quarter. I'll begin with a detailed review of our third-quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025. First, I'll start with our third quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $529.4 million, up 22% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance. Shifting to our product mix, Atlas grew 26% in the quarter compared to the previous year and now represents 68% of total revenue compared to 66% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and 71% last quarter. We recognized Atlas revenue primarily based on customer consumption of our platform and that consumption is closely tied to end user activity of their applications. Let me provide some context on Atlas consumption in the quarter. In Q3, consumption was slightly ahead of our expectations. This year's Q3 seasonal improvement was more muted than in years past as expected. On a year-over-year basis, consumption growth remains below that of prior year period. Turning to non-Atlas revenue. Non-Atlas came in significantly ahead of our expectations. As Dev mentioned, EA new business was strong, and we continue to have success selling incremental workloads into our existing customer base. In addition, our Q3 non-Atlas revenue benefited from a few large multi-year deals. As you know, due to ASC 606, we recognized the entire term license component of a multi-year contract at the start of that contract. Compared to Q3 of last year, the multi-year license component of non-Atlas revenues was over $15 million higher. Turning to customer growth. During the third quarter, we grew our customer base by approximately 1,900 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 52,600, which is up from over 46,400 in the year-ago period. Of our total customer count, over 7,400 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 6,900 in the year-ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven primarily by Atlas, which had over 51,100 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 44,900 in the year-ago period. It is important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers adding their first Atlas workload. Continuing on, in Q3, our net ARR expansion rate was approximately 120%. We ended the quarter with 2,314 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, up from $1,972 in the year-ago period. Moving down the income statement, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the third quarter was $405.7 million, representing a gross margin of 77%, which is flat versus the year-ago period. Our income from operations was $101.5 million or 19% operating margin for the third quarter compared to an 18% operating margin in the year-ago period. The primary reason for more favorable operating income results versus guidance is our revenue outperformance, including the very high margin multi-year license revenue benefit. Net income in the third quarter was $98.1 million or $1.16 per share, based on 84.2 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a net income of $79.1 million or $0.96 per share on 83.7 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding in the year-ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the third quarter with $2.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $37.4 million. After taking into consideration approximately $2.9 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was $34.6 million in the quarter. This compares to free cash flow of $35 million in the year-ago period. In Q3, we did not incur capital expenditures to purchase IPV4 addresses as we previously expected, but we did start making those purchases in November and still expect a total outlay of $20 million to $25 million this fiscal year as we previously communicated. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $515 million to $519 million. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $55 million to $58 million and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.65 based on 84.9 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. For the full-fiscal year 2025, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.973 billion to $1.977 billion, non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $242 million to $245 million, and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $3.01 to $3.03 based on 84 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. Note that the non-GAAP net income per share guidance for the fourth-quarter and full-fiscal year 2025 includes a non-GAAP tax provision of approximately 20%. I'll now provide some more context around our updated guidance. First, in terms of Atlas consumption, we expect to see a typical seasonal slowdown in Q4, driven by underlying application usage moderating during the holiday season. Second, since Atlas consumption remained lower on a year-over-year basis in Q3, we expect to see continued deceleration of Atlas year-over-year growth in Q4. Third, we expect to see a sequential decline in non-Atlas revenue in Q4, which is contrary to our normal pattern. The reason for this is that we experienced a significant additional benefit from multi-year deals in Q3, which we do not expect to recur in Q4. In addition, I want to provide some incremental color on some of our recent product and -- how some of our recent product and go-to-market changes will impact the growth of our reported customer count going forward. First, as Dev explained, we are reallocating a portion of our go-to-market resources from the mid-market to the enterprise channel. As a result, we expect to see significantly fewer mid-market direct sales customer net additions and as a result, slower direct sales customer growth going forward. We believe this reallocation of investment dollars will drive higher revenue growth over time. So, it's a trade-off that makes sense. Second, as we introduce Atlas Flex clusters in Q4 and automatically migrate customers in Q1, we expect to see a one-time negative impact to our customer count since we have approximately 4,000 serverless customers who are very low spending and we do not expect them to transition over to Flex. These customers have a negligible impact on our revenue but will impact our reported customer count. To summarize, we're pleased with our third quarter results and especially our ability to win new business. We have a small share in one of the largest and fastest-growing markets in all of software with a number of secular tailwinds, including AI at our back. We'll continue investing judiciously and focusing on our execution to capture this long-term opportunity. With that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator? Questions & Answers: Operator [Operator instructions] Our first question for the day will be coming from Sanjit Singh of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Thank you for taking the questions and congrats, Michael, on outstanding career. You had an absolutely fantastic run at MongoDB. I'm excited to see what you do next, or excited if you just take a breather. So congrats, Michael. I guess to take the question -- to start off with the questions, when we look at what Atlas has been doing in the past two quarters, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think consumption is coming in at least modestly ahead of your expectations. Relative to what we've seen at the beginning of the year, what sort of -- is it a function of sales execution? Is it a function of the end-user activity sort of improving? What's driving at least the improvement in Atlas consumption in the past two quarters? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So a few different things. So I think if you look at our outlook at the beginning of the year, we had indicated that we thought we would see stable Atlas growth from a consumption standpoint. What we've seen and what we've talked about is -- we've actually seen lower year-over-year growth based on the underlying consumption. And so -- and that's incorporated into our Q4 guide. We have seen the Q3 and Q4 be -- sorry, Q2 and Q3, excuse me, be better than our expectations, but it's still down on a year-over-year basis. And so I want to make sure that we're not sort of confusing the comparative set of year-over-year versus relative to our expectations. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Understood. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer And the core of it, Sanjit, to your question is really the underlying usage of the applications. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Yeah, that makes total sense. And then, Dev, I have to ask you the AI agent question. In terms of an AI agent needing more context, it has going to have a set of tools to take its actions. What does it mean for MongoDB as an operational data store as customers start to roll out more agentic applications? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, just to talk about agents, I think when you think about agents, there's jobs, there's -- sorry, there's a job, there's projects and then there's task. Right now, the agents that are being rolled out are really focused on task like say something from Sierra or some other companies are rolling out agents. But you're right, what they deemed to do is to deal with being able to create a rich and complex data structures. Now why is this important for AI is that AI models don't just look at isolated data points, but they need to understand relationships, hierarchies, and patterns within the data. They need to be able to essentially get real-time insights. For example, if you have a chatbot where someone is querying, a customer is kind of trying to get some update on the order they placed five minutes ago because they may have not gotten any confirmation, your chatbot needs to be able to deal with real-time information. You need to be able to deal with basically handling very advanced use cases, understanding like, to do things like fraud detection to understand behaviors of supply chains, you need to understand intricate data relationships. All these things are consistent with MongoDB offers. And so we believe that at the end of the day, we are well-positioned to handle this. And the other thing that I would say is that we've embedded in a very natural way of search and vector search. So we're just not an OLTP database, we do tech search and vector search. That's all one experience and no other platform offers that, and we think we have a real advantage. And so we're integrated with the leading AI frameworks and platforms. We have enterprise-grade security and compliance, and customers can run us anywhere, either on 118 cloud regions or on-prem, and that again is a huge differentiator for us. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Awesome. Appreciate the thoughts, Dev. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Sanjit. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Taylor -- Tyler Radke of Citi. Your line is open. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Hi, thank you very much for taking the question. And, Michael, all the best, and congratulations on 10 years. Going back to the sales execution, I mean, one of the things that you talked about earlier this year was some challenges just in terms of the recently acquired workloads ramping. And I think a lot of those were from the past fiscal year. So curious how the quality of workload acquisition has trended this year. And as you think about the ramp in consumption potential into next year, how does that sort of look versus this time a year ago? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Maybe I'll just talk about what we're doing and the changes we made and then Michael can talk a little bit about the consumption trends. So, we did make some changes at the beginning of the year, and we really wanted to focus on both the volume and the quality of the workloads and there were some slight adjustments that we made. We think those changes are having a reasonable positive impact. Again, it's too early to declare victory because these workloads usually start small and grow over time, but we're really pleased with the results we're seeing so far. And -- but again, it's early days. And obviously, we'll know about the fiscal '25 workloads as we go into fiscal '26. But so far, so good. Michael, on consumption? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, just a couple of things, and thanks, Tyler. The fiscal '24 cohorts that we called out earlier, that slower growth does continue. They've been in line with our revised expectations. We made some changes that we talked about at the -- earlier in the year that should affect the fiscal '25 cohorts, but it's just too early to tell. On those, we need a few more quarters of data before you can really see if we're -- how we're seeing those behave differently. I will say we've talked about the new business environment and our success in new business. We have been pleased with that, but that just shows kind of the initial piece, and we need to see how they grow and how those cohorts evolve. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Great. Thanks. And follow-up on the EA side, you talked about the outsized strength in non-Atlas business this quarter. Maybe if you could unpack like the relative upside that was driven by simply duration versus new business. I know you called out the duration impact year-over-year, but are -- do you feel like this was sort of a one-off or do you feel like maybe some of your bigger customers are indexing more toward EA and how does that impact the way you think about the product and introducing things like vector search and stream processing onto the on-prem product? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, thank you. So overall, we continue to find the EA product resonate with customers. It's an important part of the run anywhere strategy and we've continued to see success with that and people wanting to increase their investment in MongoDB. There's always been a multiyear component and we continue to see that. We talked about that at the beginning of the year as to how fiscal '24 had an abnormally high amount of multi-year benefit and therefore, we were anticipating that being a headwind and we quantified that in roughly the $40 million range. What we talked about on this call earlier is we saw from a few large accounts, a surprising amount of multiyear that positively benefited Q3 at a little more than $15 million in revenue compared to what we saw Q3 a year ago. So, not as much of a headwind as we had been expecting. Obviously, with the 606 dynamics, some of these things, especially for a large deal can be kind of meaty and chunky and lumpy, which is why we try and call it out and sort of help people understand, but there's a pretty healthy kind of baseline flow, not just of EA, but also of multiyear. And when we see spikes, we just try and call it out for you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I just want to add, Tyler, that we are investing in our what we call our EA business. First, we're starting by investing with search and vector search and a community product. That does a couple of things for us. One, whenever anyone starts with MongoDB with the open-source product, they immediately get all the benefits of that complete highly integrated platform. Two, those capabilities will then migrate to EA. So, EA for us is an investment strategy. We definitely see lots of large customers who are very, very committed to running workloads on-prem. We even see some customers want to run to run AI workloads on-prem. So, the optionality they get by using MongoDB to not just be on-prem and the cloud, but also cross-cloud is a very compelling one. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Brad Reback of Stifel. Your line is open. Brad Reback -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. And, Michael, best of luck. It's been a great run. Dev, you started the call talking about a bunch of investments, which are great given the growth of the business. And obviously, you talked about reallocating some expenses. But net-net, should we think about this incremental investment phase next year as gating margin upside? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think that's something that we obviously are not ready to talk about next year just now, but I would say that we -- the reason we're looking to invest and just to summarize again, going up-market on legacy app modernization where we see very large workloads potentially at play and being the ideal database for GenAI apps, which is the future as important investments to drive long-term growth. And we're quite energized by those investments and that's something that we have high conviction on. Brad Reback -- Analyst That's great. And then on the MAAP program, are most of those workloads going to wind up in Atlas or will that be a healthy combination of EA and Atlas? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think it's again early days. I would say -- I would probably say more on the side of Atlas and EA in the early days. I think once we introduce a search and vector search into the EA product, you'll see more of that on-prem. Obviously, people can use MongoDB for AI workloads using other technologies as well in conjunction with MongoDB for on-prem AI use cases. But I would say you're probably going to see that happen first in Atlas. Brad Reback -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Jason Ader of William Blair. Your line is open. Jason Ader -- Analyst Yeah, thank you. I'm not going to belabor congratulating Michael, but it has been it has been fun working with you and best of luck. The question I had is on the strength in EA. Do you think, Dev, it represents a comment on how enterprises might be rethinking or reassessing the kind of on-prem versus cloud workload placement decision? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Well, when I think about large enterprises, I think large enterprises have meaningful workloads that are still running on-prem. I think the belief that everything would go to the cloud was probably something that was really popular in the good old days of Zurp. But I think now as customers assess their investments that they already have in place, they're being much more judicious about where they run those workloads and if they think they can leverage their existing investments in their own infrastructure, then they're going to do so. Also for a bunch of other reasons like regulatory reasons, some customers are quite not moving as aggressively to the cloud. We see that in particularly in Europe, where we see a lot of the European banks still running majority of the workloads on-prem. So it also varies by region where conversely in Asia, we're seeing people much move much more aggressively to the cloud. So I think it really depends on industry, on geography, and on the personal dynamics of what's happening in that particular account. I mean, we see some large US banks are also very committed to running things on-prem. So it really varies. And that's why we feel really good about our run anywhere strategy because it gives customer optionality. They can build something and run on-prem. And if and when they choose to move to the cloud, it's very easy to do so with MongoDB. Jason Ader -- Analyst All right. And then just as a follow-up also on the investments you're making in strategic sales and enterprise. Could you just get a little more specific on what those investments might be? Is it hiring a lot of new salespeople? Is it working more with SIs, investing more in SIs? Any additional detail would be helpful. Thanks. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So just for everyone's benefit, we've identified a number of accounts, which we call strategic accounts, which we think that have high upside for us. We've seen a number of accounts that grow very quickly when we deploy the right mix of resources. Now they're all not necessarily quota-carrying resources. They could be additional technical sales resources, additional PS resources, additional customer service resources to better service and support those accounts. We even do things like run education sessions for developers of the accounts, they're called either hackathons or like what we call developer days or even design reviews where we'll meet with our development teams who are looking to build an application, help them think about how they would potentially use MongoDB to build that particular app. And what we find is that because many of these developers, the experience with MongoDB is quite limited, the more we can engage with them, the more we can educate them and the more we can show them how simple and easy it is. Like for example, most customers today think like they have to use an OLTP database, then a search database, maybe a vector database, and then like a caching database. And all that is integrated in MongoDB. So all of a sudden, customers can say, wow, I can simplify my life, simplify my back-end infrastructure, build this app far more quickly and it will be much more easier to manage long-term if I do everything on MongoDB. And it's really a function of just educating them on the power of MongoDB that really opens up a lot of opportunities for us. So that's why we're doubling down, and the mix of resources is really predicated on the accounts, but it's not just quota counting resources, it's the whole suite of resources that we're bringing to the table. Jason Ader -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Andrew Nowinski of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Okay. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking the question and congrats on a nice quarter. You gave an example of a customer that migrated off Postgres and I think you said they had issues with their PG vector function. I was wondering how long was that customer using Postgres before they decided to make a change to Mongo, meaning was this some sort of like a rebound type customer where they chose PG -- or excuse me, Postgres and it didn't work? And then how frequently are you seeing this type of transition? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So I can't give you the specifics on how long they were using Postgres, but this is not -- this is a trend that we're seeing in our business. You have to remember Postgres is a 40-year-old technology. It's -- and they have been the beneficiary of people lifting and shifting from other types of relational databases, Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, et cetera. And they're an open-source database. And but as part -- because they're an open-source and relational database, they have the same inherent challenges all relational databases do. They're quite inflexible. So once you build a schema, it's very hard to change the schema. It's hard to scale and hard to distribute data. And if you have large data volumes, you have to do weird things like, for example, resort to off-road storage for large data objects, which creates performance bottlenecks. And so again, people default to Postgres if they don't know anything better because all they know is relational and everyone is kind of moving off those other relational platforms. And that's the whole point I was saying earlier. Once we educate developers on the flexibility of schema, how easily or horizontally scale the rich query language where you can do aggregations and do sophisticated geospatial indexes, the productivity gains by using the document model and how easy is to organize data, it's -- people are just like, wow, life is so much easier. Now I want to be clear, this is not a zero-sum game. Postgres does not have to fail for us to be successful. It's a big market and we're quite excited about the opportunity, but we do see customers moving off Postgres and coming to MongoDB. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Thank you. That was very helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up. If we normalize the $15 million multiyear deal impact you had in Q3, would EA still be down sequentially in Q4? Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer We haven't given that level of guidance, but just trying to help you understand in the context of the full-year numbers and the headwind that we talked about at the beginning of the year, just given the strength that we saw in Q3. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Got it. Thanks. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. The next question will be coming from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst Hey, thank you. And if you think about the EA strength this quarter, Michael, you'd kind of give us a little bit there. Like how should we think about renewal -- the renewal situation renewal pool coming up like or that you had in Q3, coming up in Q4, et cetera, as well and then like what does it mean in terms of upsell, cross-sell opportunity as people think about starting AI projects by self-serve, as you kind of mentioned earlier on the call? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So I think about -- if you think about EA for Q4, it tends to be a large renewal quarter, but what we're talking about in terms of the guide is because we had such strength in multiyear, that's where we would expect to see our EA down sequentially, which is not typically our pattern, which is why we called it out. In terms of AI workloads and some of those other things, I think it's early to tell and obviously, we'll continue to evolve and assess our view when we get to the full-year guide in March. And then we'll also have an updated view on how the cohorts are behaving and sort of how multiyear played out. But I think in terms of Q4, the comments that I made earlier hopefully will help. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst Yeah. Okay, perfect. And then the -- and can you talk a little bit about like obviously, there's a debate of like which database will be the persistent layer if you do AI projects, et cetera. What do you see from the big hyperscalers in terms of working with you guys and partnerships? We obviously just have AWS kind of summit, et-cetera. Can you speak a little bit like how your relationship with those big guys is evolving around this? And Michael, All the best in case I don't talk to you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, I'll start with the partnerships first, like our -- with AWS, as you said, they just had their re:Invent show last week. Our -- it remains very, very strong. We've closed a ton of deals this past quarter. Some of them very, very large deals. We're doing integrations to some of the new products like Q and Bedrock and the engagement in the field has been really strong. On Azure, I think we -- as I've shared in the past, we start-off with a little bit of a slow start, but in the words of the person who runs their partner leadership, the Azure MongoDB relationship has never been stronger. We've closed a large number of deals. We're part of what's called the Azure native IC service program and have a bunch of deep integrations with Azure, including Fabric, Power BI, Visual Studio, Semantic Kernel, and Azure OpenAI Studio. And we're also one of Azure's largest marketplace partners. And GCP does -- we have actually seen some uptick in terms of co-sales that we've done this past quarter and GCP made some comp changes where they -- that were favorable to working with MongoDB that we saw some results in the field, and we're focused on closing on -- closing a handful of large deals with GCP in Q4. So in general, I would say, things are going quite well. And then in terms of, I guess, implying your question was like the hyperscalers and are they potentially bundling things along with their AI offerings? I mean, candidly, since day one, the hyperscalers have been bundling their database offerings with every offering that they have and that's been their predominant strategy. And we've -- I think we've executed well against strategy because databases are not like a by-the-way decision. It's an important decision. And I think the hyperscalers are seeing our performance and realize it's better to partner with us. And as I said, customers understand the importance of the data layer, especially for AI applications. And so the partnership across all three hyperscalers is strong. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst OK, perfect. Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Raimo. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. The next question will be coming from the line of Brad Sills of Bank of America. Your line is open. Brad Sills -- Analyst Great. Thank you so much, and congratulations, Michael, on your next move. I wanted to ask about new workloads here on vector search, stream processing, relational migrator. Is there any one of those three that's ramping faster than maybe you expected? Just a little bit of color on how those new workload types are ramping. Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I'll kind of give you just a rundown of some of the -- I mean, essentially you're asking about the new products, like our -- on search, we introduced a new capability called Atlas search nodes, which where you can asymmetrically scale your search nodes because if you have a search-intensive use case, you don't have to scale all your nodes because they have become quite expensive. And we've seen that this kind of groundbreaking capability really well received. The demand is quite high and because customers like they can tune the configuration to the unique needs of their search requirements. One of the world's largest banks is using Atlas Search to provide like a Google-like search experience on payments data for massive corporate customers. So this is a customer-facing application and so performance, and scalability are critical. A leading provider of AI-powered accounting software uses Atlas Search to power its invoice analytics future, which allows end users and finance teams to perform ad-hoc analysis and easily find past-due invoices and voices that contain errors. So that search -- on vector search, it -- again, and it's been our kind of our first full-year since going generally available. And the product uptake has been actually very, very high. In Q3, we released quantization for Atlas Vector Search, which reduces the memory requirements by up to 96%, allowing us to support larger vector workloads with vastly improved price performance. For example, a multinational news organization created a GenAI powered tool designed to help producers and journalists efficiently search, summarize, and verify information from vast and varied data sources. A leading security firm is using Atlas Vector Search to fight AI fraud and a leading global media company replaced elastic search with hybrid search and vector search use case for a user recommendation engine that's built to suggest -- that's built in to suggest articles to end users. And so that's super exciting to see as well. We're also seeing a lot of interest in our streaming product, demand is very high. We just rolled it out to another hyperscaler, and customers are commenting on that the use cases of being able to embed stream processing with MongoDB makes our life so much easier. So overall, we're quite pleased with the progress we're making on the new products. And as I said before, natively bundling all these capabilities really reduces or eliminates the need for customers to have to bolt on a bunch of different technologies to solve the same problem, saving them a lot of time, money, cost, and risk. Brad Sills -- Analyst That's really exciting. Thanks, Dev. And then I wanted to ask a question around Cedric's appointment. Any focus that may be different here under his leadership that we should be thinking about going forward? Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer No, Cedric has been our CRO for, gosh, now like I think like five, six years, and he -- I was the Interim CRO for about three quarters until he took over when we last made a change and this is really an expansion of his responsibilities. I've known Cedric for a long time. He and I have worked with at multiple different companies. I think I have a good barometer for understanding sales leadership. There's a number of sales leaders who worked at other top-tier software companies who used to work for me or with me. And so I'm super-excited by the role Cedric is going to take and then we're also making some changes under Cedric to better align the different organizations so that we can more tightly work together on going up-market, on app monetization and positioning ourselves well to be the ideal database for GenAI apps. Brad Sills -- Analyst Super exciting. Thanks, Dev. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Brad. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question, please. Our next question will be coming from the line of Mike Cikos of Needham and Company. Your line is open. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Hey guys, thanks for taking the question here. I just wanted to come back to the consumption growth being slightly better than expectations again for the second quarter in a row now. And apologies if I missed it, but this improvement that we're seeing, is this across all vintages and geographies or is it potentially more concentrated in scope? Just trying to get a better understanding of what's seeking place out there and what's embedded in the guide. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. No, I would describe it as broad-based, Mike. And obviously, we're pleased to see it and we're continuing monitoring and slicing and dicing it in different ways. And as we have information or insights to you, we'll share it. And without trying to throw a whole bunch of cold water on our mind, it was slightly better, or a step-function changed better, but good to see. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Terrific. And maybe for a quick follow-up for Dev. I think it builds off maybe Tyler's question at the top of the Q&A, but you had cited that some customers are thinking about their workloads more holistically and even looking to run AI workloads on-prem. How much of that do you think is just a function of customers are still trying to figure out how to optimize for latency and cost or is this more a demonstration of we really are in the early phases of the exploratory phase versus going into production? Is there any way to coarse that out or is the two not necessarily connected? Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer No, I think it's kind of a little bit of both. I think you have some customers who are very committed to running a big part of the estate on-prem. So by definition, then if they're going to build an AI workload, it has to be run on-prem, which means that they also need access to GPUs and they're doing that. And then other customers are leveraging basically renting GPUs from the cloud providers and building their own AI workloads. I do think we're in the very, very early days. They're still learning, experimenting. More-and-more apps are entering production. And as I said on the prepared remarks, we have thousands of workload -- AI workloads running on MongoDB, but a very small percentage of them have demonstrated meaningful product market fit. And so the initial traction is kind of still small. But I think as people get more sophisticated with AI, as the AI technology matures and becomes more and more useful, I think applications will -- you'll start seeing these applications take-off. I kind of chuckled that today I see more senior leaders bragging about the chips they're using versus the apps they're building. So it just tells you that we're still in the very, very early days of this big platform shift. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Great point. Thank you again, guys. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Mike. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Eric Heath of KeyBanc. Your line is open. Eric Heath -- Analyst Hi, thanks for taking the question. Dev, Michael, it sounds like the takeaway from the call is a greater focus on EA and on enterprise. So should we structurally rethink the EA business differently and think of this more as a healthy double-digit growth business going forward for the foreseeable future? And then if I could just ask a follow-up question separate to that. But Michael, I understand that it's still early to identify the fiscal '25 cohort of workloads, but just curious at a high-level if they look and feel like of higher quality than the fiscal '24 cohort of workflow. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Do you want to take on the first one in terms of EA... Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, I mean, I would say, I mean, we are very committed to our run anywhere strategy. And as I said, we are first investing in community where for many customers is the first way they experience MongoDB. And we want them to have the full experience of integrating search and Vector search into our core product. And so they can out of the gate really start building applications. That will then transition to building those capabilities into EA. So, we are clearly investing in the EA product. But Atlas is still a big, big part of our business and a big, big part of our growth engine and we typically launch new features on Atlas and because of the capabilities we already have, the fact it's multi-cloud makes it a very, very compelling offering for many customers. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. And I think in terms of the workloads, I do think it's early. Just as a reminder for folks, they tend to start small, although grow quickly. I think the only other thing that I can add is, we've been pretty consistent and that we've been pleased with the new business that we've done. But we need some time to let the cohorts play out as we track them. But I think like I said, we've been happy with the new business that we were winning. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of William Power of Baird. Your line is open. Brian Raferty Denyeau -- Investor Relations You there, William? William Power -- Analyst Sorry, yeah. Thank you. Dev, you had some encouraging comments on relational migrator. I wonder if you could just touch on what you think is driving the higher interest here. I mean, it sounds like AI is contributing and helping, but it'd be great to get some more color there because that still feels like obviously a meaningful long-term opportunity. And then maybe the second part of the question for Dev or Michael, just be great to get any other framework around the professional services investments. Any way to kind of think about quantification and timing of that? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So the reason we're so excited about the opportunity to go after legacy applications is that, one, it seems like there's a confluence of events happening. One is that the increasing cost and tax of supporting and managing these legacy apps are just going up enough. Second, for many customers who are in regulated industries, the regulators are calling their -- the fact that they're running on these legacy apps with systemic risk, so they can no longer kick the can down the road. Third, also because they no longer can kick the can around, some vendors are going end-of-life, so they have to make a decision to migrate those applications to a more modern tech stack. Fourth, because GenAI is so predicated on data and to build a competitive advantage, you need to leverage your proprietary data, people want to access that data and be able to do so easily. And so that's another reason for them to want to modernize. And then you also have people who built those applications who are retiring or just no longer in the firm, so it just creates more and more risk for the companies. Given all that, customers are incredibly interested in figuring out a way to easily and safely and securely migrate those -- off those applications. And we always could help them very easily move the data and map the schema from a relational schema to a document schema. The hardest part was essentially rewriting the application. Now with the advent of GenAI, you can now significantly reduce the time. One, you can use GenAI to analyze existing code. Two, you can use GenAI to reverse engineer tests to test what the code does. And then three, you can use GenAI to build new code and then users test it to ensure that the new code produces the same results as the old code. And so all that time and effort is suddenly cut in a meaningful way and that's suddenly creating a lot of interest from customers saying, my goodness. And if you're already on a relational app, moving to another relational app doesn't feel like modernization. So, the other advantage is that moving to MongoDB gives them a much more modern platform, a much more agile, flexible, performant, and scalable platform for their future needs. And that's why we're so excited. Again, it's early days. We've run a number of pilots that have gone well. We're in the process of working with some customers now in the migration process. This will take time because these are very, very complex applications. And actually, one thing I also mentioned was that they're not just going after -- saying go after some tertiary Tier 2 or Tier 3 application, they're saying, hey, we want you to look at some of our crown jewels because these are the apps that are most painful for us. So that's also very exciting. But again, this will take time, but we're very committed to this, and we think this is going to drive -- help us drive long-term -- meaningful long-term growth. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, Will. And to the last part of your question on the professional services investment, we're really building out that capacity in order to meet the demand that we're seeing relative to the opportunity. We're calling it in particular because it has a gross margin impact because that's where that will typically show up. And then maybe the last thing and it's probably obvious, but just to sort of underscore it is the reason we're doing this though is for the ARR, right, to drive the new workloads, the additional workloads over to MongoDB as part of that migration. And over time, as we've talked about before, we hope and expect to be able to leverage technology more and more, but at least initially and into the medium-term, there's going to be a healthy human/services component to that. Just wanted to sort of effectively telegraph that out to folks. William Power -- Analyst That's helpful. Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Will. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Rudy Kessinger of DA Davidson. Please go ahead. Rudy Kessinger -- Analyst Hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in here. I believe last quarter you said consumption growth slightly ahead of expectations. And while down slower year-over-year growth versus Q2 last year, the year-over-year growth did improve from Q1. And so, I guess I'm curious for Q3, could you make a comment in that same regard? Obviously, slower on a year-over-year basis than Q3 last year, but was it stable with year-over-year consumption growth in Q2 or better or worse? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Rudy, thanks for the question. We haven't specifically called that out relative to Q2. We did see a lower year-over-year growth as we called out. We did see a seasonal rebound. Usually Q3 is stronger than Q2 and we talked about how that was smaller than in the prior year. So hopefully, that will help you all triangulate. Rudy Kessinger -- Analyst Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. I believe it was on your Q4 call back in March. At that point, Dev, you said it would be at least another year until AI applications are being deployed at scale. It sounds like the commentary that some early large workloads, but out of the thousands, just not many that are at large scale. I guess, is your expectation now that maybe it's still at least another year until we're seeing broad AI application rollouts at scale? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I think a lot of it's a function of the what's happening in the R&D side of AI, right? So for example, today, we don't have a very compelling model designed for our phones, right, because today the phones don't have the computing horsepower to run complex models. So, you don't see a ton of very, very successful consumer apps besides, say, ChatGPT or Claude. So we don't -- we also don't see like hundreds of apps taking off like you saw kind of the first generation of like the Internet or the cloud era, right, or the mobile era. So like I think we're still in the early days of AI. And so while we see a lot of people building AI apps, a lot of them have kind of fairly rudimentary functionality. But I think that over time that's going to change. In fact, I know it will change. I just can't predict when that will happen. But where we do see apps having production, we are having traction, we're seeing them grow very, very quickly and we have a lot of them on our platform. It's just very few of them are really have meaningful. Operator Thank you. And that concludes today's Q&A session. I would like to go ahead and turn the call back over to Dev for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, everyone. I just wanted to say we're really pleased with our Q3 results with strong new business performance and revenue exceeding expectations both -- across both Atlas and EA. We're making the necessary investments to expand our enterprise channel where we see the largest opportunity to establish MongoDB as a standard and the strongest returns on our go-to-market investments. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the progress we're making on both accelerating legacy app modernization with AI as well as establishing ourselves as a standard of the emerging AI tech stack for greenfield AI applications. And last but not least, I would like to thank Michael again for his contributions over the past 10 years and wish him well. Thank you, everyone, and we'll talk to you soon.

count, 7,400 direct sale customers, compare 6,900 year-ago period. growth total customer count driven primarily atlas, 51,100 customer end quarter compared 44,900 year-ago period. important keep mind growth atlas customer count reflects new customer mongodb addition existing ea customer adding first atlas workload. continuing on, q3, net arr expansion rate approximately 120%. ended quarter 2,314 customer least $100,000 arr annualized mrr, $1,972 year-ago period. moving income statement, discussing result non-gaap basis unless otherwise noted. gross profit third quarter $405.7 million, representing gross margin 77%, flat versus year-ago period. income operation $101.5 million 19% operating margin third quarter compared 18% operating margin year-ago period. primary reason favorable operating income result versus guidance revenue outperformance, including high margin multi-year license revenue benefit. net income third quarter $98.1 million $1.16 per share, based 84.2 million diluted weighted average share outstanding. compare net income $79.1 million $0.96 per share 83.7 million diluted weighted-average share outstanding year-ago period. turning balance sheet cash flow, ended third quarter $2.3 billion cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash. operating cash flow third quarter $37.4 million. taking consideration approximately $2.9 million capital expenditure principal repayment finance lease liabilities, free cash flow $34.6 million quarter. compare free cash flow $35 million year-ago period. q3, incur capital expenditure purchase ipv4 address previously expected, start making purchase november still expect total outlay $20 million $25 million fiscal year previously communicated. like turn outlook fourth quarter full fiscal year 2025. fourth quarter, expect revenue range $515 million $519 million. expect non-gaap income operation range $55 million $58 million non-gaap net income per share range $0.62 $0.65 based 84.9 million estimated diluted weighted-average share outstanding. full-fiscal year 2025, expect revenue range $1.973 billion $1.977 billion, non-gaap income operation range $242 million $245 million, non-gaap net income per share range $3.01 $3.03 based 84 million estimated diluted weighted-average share outstanding. note non-gaap net income per share guidance fourth-quarter full-fiscal year 2025 includes non-gaap tax provision approximately 20%. provide context around updated guidance. first, term atlas consumption, expect see typical seasonal slowdown q4, driven underlying application usage moderating holiday season. second, since atlas consumption remained lower year-over-year basis q3, expect see continued deceleration atlas year-over-year growth q4. third, expect see sequential decline non-atlas revenue q4, contrary normal pattern. reason experienced significant additional benefit multi-year deal q3, expect recur q4. addition, want provide incremental color recent product -- recent product go-to-market change impact growth reported customer count going forward. first, dev explained, reallocating portion go-to-market resource mid-market enterprise channel. result, expect see significantly fewer mid-market direct sale customer net addition result, slower direct sale customer growth going forward. believe reallocation investment dollar drive higher revenue growth time. so, trade-off make sense. second, introduce atlas flex cluster q4 automatically migrate customer q1, expect see one-time negative impact customer count since approximately 4,000 serverless customer low spending expect transition flex. customer negligible impact revenue impact reported customer count. summarize, pleased third quarter result especially ability win new business. small share one largest fastest-growing market software number secular tailwinds, including ai back. continue investing judiciously focusing execution capture long-term opportunity. that, like open questions. operator? question & answers: operator [operator instructions] first question day coming sanjit singh morgan stanley. line open. sanjit singh -- analyst thank taking question congrats, michael, outstanding career. absolutely fantastic run mongodb. excited see next, excited take breather. congrats, michael. guess take question -- start questions, look atlas past two quarters, correct wrong, think consumption coming least modestly ahead expectations. relative seen beginning year, sort -- function sale execution? function end-user activity sort improving? what's driving least improvement atlas consumption past two quarters? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. different things. think look outlook beginning year, indicated thought would see stable atlas growth consumption standpoint. seen talked -- actually seen lower year-over-year growth based underlying consumption. -- that's incorporated q4 guide. seen q3 q4 -- sorry, q2 q3, excuse me, better expectations, still year-over-year basis. want make sure sort confusing comparative set year-over-year versus relative expectations. sanjit singh -- analyst understood. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer core it, sanjit, question really underlying usage applications. sanjit singh -- analyst yeah, make total sense. then, dev, ask ai agent question. term ai agent needing context, going set tool take actions. mean mongodb operational data store customer start roll agentic applications? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. so, talk agents, think think agents, there's jobs, there's -- sorry, there's job, there's project there's task. right now, agent rolled really focused task like say something sierra company rolling agents. right, deemed deal able create rich complex data structures. important ai ai model look isolated data points, need understand relationships, hierarchies, pattern within data. need able essentially get real-time insights. example, chatbot someone querying, customer kind trying get update order placed five minute ago may gotten confirmation, chatbot need able deal real-time information. need able deal basically handling advanced use cases, understanding like, thing like fraud detection understand behavior supply chains, need understand intricate data relationships. thing consistent mongodb offers. believe end day, well-positioned handle this. thing would say embedded natural way search vector search. oltp database, tech search vector search. that's one experience platform offer that, think real advantage. integrated leading ai framework platforms. enterprise-grade security compliance, customer run u anywhere, either 118 cloud region on-prem, huge differentiator us. sanjit singh -- analyst awesome. appreciate thoughts, dev. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, sanjit. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line taylor -- tyler radke citi. line open. tyler radke -- analyst hi, thank much taking question. and, michael, best, congratulation 10 years. going back sale execution, mean, one thing talked earlier year challenge term recently acquired workload ramping. think lot past fiscal year. curious quality workload acquisition trended year. think ramp consumption potential next year, sort look versus time year ago? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. maybe talk change made michael talk little bit consumption trends. so, make change beginning year, really wanted focus volume quality workload slight adjustment made. think change reasonable positive impact. again, early declare victory workload usually start small grow time, really pleased result seeing far. -- again, early days. obviously, know fiscal '25 workload go fiscal '26. far, good. michael, consumption? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, couple things, thanks, tyler. fiscal '24 cohort called earlier, slower growth continue. line revised expectations. made change talked -- earlier year affect fiscal '25 cohorts, early tell. those, need quarter data really see -- seeing behave differently. say talked new business environment success new business. pleased that, show kind initial piece, need see grow cohort evolve. tyler radke -- analyst great. thanks. follow-up ea side, talked outsized strength non-atlas business quarter. maybe could unpack like relative upside driven simply duration versus new business. know called duration impact year-over-year, -- feel like sort one-off feel like maybe bigger customer indexing toward ea impact way think product introducing thing like vector search stream processing onto on-prem product? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah, thank you. overall, continue find ea product resonate customers. important part run anywhere strategy continued see success people wanting increase investment mongodb. there's always multiyear component continue see that. talked beginning year fiscal '24 abnormally high amount multi-year benefit therefore, anticipating headwind quantified roughly $40 million range. talked call earlier saw large accounts, surprising amount multiyear positively benefited q3 little $15 million revenue compared saw q3 year ago. so, much headwind expecting. obviously, 606 dynamics, things, especially large deal kind meaty chunky lumpy, try call sort help people understand, there's pretty healthy kind baseline flow, ea, also multiyear. see spikes, try call you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. want add, tyler, investing call ea business. first, starting investing search vector search community product. couple thing us. one, whenever anyone start mongodb open-source product, immediately get benefit complete highly integrated platform. two, capability migrate ea. so, ea u investment strategy. definitely see lot large customer very, committed running workload on-prem. even see customer want run run ai workload on-prem. so, optionality get using mongodb on-prem cloud, also cross-cloud compelling one. tyler radke -- analyst thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line brad reback stifel. line open. brad reback -- analyst great. thanks much. and, michael, best luck. great run. dev, started call talking bunch investments, great given growth business. obviously, talked reallocating expenses. net-net, think incremental investment phase next year gating margin upside? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer think that's something obviously ready talk next year now, would say -- reason looking invest summarize again, going up-market legacy app modernization see large workload potentially play ideal database genai apps, future important investment drive long-term growth. quite energized investment that's something high conviction on. brad reback -- analyst that's great. maap program, workload going wind atlas healthy combination ea atlas? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer think early days. would say -- would probably say side atlas ea early days. think introduce search vector search ea product, see on-prem. obviously, people use mongodb ai workload using technology well conjunction mongodb on-prem ai use cases. would say probably going see happen first atlas. brad reback -- analyst great. thanks much. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line jason ader william blair. line open. jason ader -- analyst yeah, thank you. going belabor congratulating michael, fun working best luck. question strength ea. think, dev, represents comment enterprise might rethinking reassessing kind on-prem versus cloud workload placement decision? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer well, think large enterprises, think large enterprise meaningful workload still running on-prem. think belief everything would go cloud probably something really popular good old day zurp. think customer assess investment already place, much judicious run workload think leverage existing investment infrastructure, going so. also bunch reason like regulatory reasons, customer quite moving aggressively cloud. see particularly europe, see lot european bank still running majority workload on-prem. also varies region conversely asia, seeing people much move much aggressively cloud. think really depends industry, geography, personal dynamic what's happening particular account. mean, see large u bank also committed running thing on-prem. really varies. that's feel really good run anywhere strategy give customer optionality. build something run on-prem. choose move cloud, easy mongodb. jason ader -- analyst right. follow-up also investment making strategic sale enterprise. could get little specific investment might be? hiring lot new salespeople? working sis, investing sis? additional detail would helpful. thanks. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. everyone's benefit, identified number accounts, call strategic accounts, think high upside us. seen number account grow quickly deploy right mix resources. necessarily quota-carrying resources. could additional technical sale resources, additional p resources, additional customer service resource better service support accounts. even thing like run education session developer accounts, called either hackathons like call developer day even design review meet development team looking build application, help think would potentially use mongodb build particular app. find many developers, experience mongodb quite limited, engage them, educate show simple easy is. like example, customer today think like use oltp database, search database, maybe vector database, like caching database. integrated mongodb. sudden, customer say, wow, simplify life, simplify back-end infrastructure, build app far quickly much easier manage long-term everything mongodb. really function educating power mongodb really open lot opportunity us. that's doubling down, mix resource really predicated accounts, quota counting resources, whole suite resource bringing table. jason ader -- analyst thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line andrew nowinski well fargo. line open. andrew nowinski -- analyst okay. good afternoon. thank much taking question congrats nice quarter. gave example customer migrated postgres think said issue pg vector function. wondering long customer using postgres decided make change mongo, meaning sort like rebound type customer chose pg -- excuse me, postgres work? frequently seeing type transition? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. can't give specific long using postgres, -- trend seeing business. remember postgres 40-year-old technology. -- beneficiary people lifting shifting type relational databases, oracle, sql server, mysql, et cetera. open-source database. part -- open-source relational database, inherent challenge relational database do. quite inflexible. build schema, hard change schema. hard scale hard distribute data. large data volumes, weird thing like, example, resort off-road storage large data objects, creates performance bottlenecks. again, people default postgres know anything better know relational everyone kind moving relational platforms. that's whole point saying earlier. educate developer flexibility schema, easily horizontally scale rich query language aggregation sophisticated geospatial indexes, productivity gain using document model easy organize data, -- people like, wow, life much easier. want clear, zero-sum game. postgres fail u successful. big market quite excited opportunity, see customer moving postgres coming mongodb. andrew nowinski -- analyst thank you. helpful. maybe quick follow-up. normalize $15 million multiyear deal impact q3, would ea still sequentially q4? thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer given level guidance, trying help understand context full-year number headwind talked beginning year, given strength saw q3. andrew nowinski -- analyst got it. thanks. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line raimo lenschow barclays. line open. raimo lenschow -- analyst hey, thank you. think ea strength quarter, michael, kind give u little bit there. like think renewal -- renewal situation renewal pool coming like q3, coming q4, et cetera, well like mean term upsell, cross-sell opportunity people think starting ai project self-serve, kind mentioned earlier call? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. think -- think ea q4, tends large renewal quarter, talking term guide strength multiyear, that's would expect see ea sequentially, typically pattern, called out. term ai workload things, think early tell obviously, continue evolve assess view get full-year guide march. also updated view cohort behaving sort multiyear played out. think term q4, comment made earlier hopefully help. raimo lenschow -- analyst yeah. okay, perfect. -- talk little bit like obviously, there's debate like database persistent layer ai projects, et cetera. see big hyperscalers term working guy partnerships? obviously aws kind summit, et-cetera. speak little bit like relationship big guy evolving around this? michael, best case talk you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. so, start partnership first, like -- aws, said, re:invent show last week. -- remains very, strong. closed ton deal past quarter. very, large deals. integration new product like q bedrock engagement field really strong. azure, think -- shared past, start-off little bit slow start, word person run partner leadership, azure mongodb relationship never stronger. closed large number deals. part what's called azure native ic service program bunch deep integration azure, including fabric, power bi, visual studio, semantic kernel, azure openai studio. also one azure's largest marketplace partners. gcp -- actually seen uptick term co-sales done past quarter gcp made comp change -- favorable working mongodb saw result field, focused closing -- closing handful large deal gcp q4. general, would say, thing going quite well. term of, guess, implying question like hyperscalers potentially bundling thing along ai offerings? mean, candidly, since day one, hyperscalers bundling database offering every offering that's predominant strategy. -- think executed well strategy database like by-the-way decision. important decision. think hyperscalers seeing performance realize better partner us. said, customer understand importance data layer, especially ai applications. partnership across three hyperscalers strong. raimo lenschow -- analyst ok, perfect. thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer thanks, raimo. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line brad sill bank america. line open. brad sill -- analyst great. thank much, congratulations, michael, next move. wanted ask new workload vector search, stream processing, relational migrator. one three that's ramping faster maybe expected? little bit color new workload type ramping. thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. kind give rundown -- mean, essentially asking new products, like -- search, introduced new capability called atlas search nodes, asymmetrically scale search node search-intensive use case, scale node become quite expensive. seen kind groundbreaking capability really well received. demand quite high customer like tune configuration unique need search requirements. one world's largest bank using atlas search provide like google-like search experience payment data massive corporate customers. customer-facing application performance, scalability critical. leading provider ai-powered accounting software us atlas search power invoice analytics future, allows end user finance team perform ad-hoc analysis easily find past-due invoice voice contain errors. search -- vector search, -- again, kind first full-year since going generally available. product uptake actually very, high. q3, released quantization atlas vector search, reduces memory requirement 96%, allowing u support larger vector workload vastly improved price performance. example, multinational news organization created genai powered tool designed help producer journalist efficiently search, summarize, verify information vast varied data sources. leading security firm using atlas vector search fight ai fraud leading global medium company replaced elastic search hybrid search vector search use case user recommendation engine that's built suggest -- that's built suggest article end users. that's super exciting see well. also seeing lot interest streaming product, demand high. rolled another hyperscaler, customer commenting use case able embed stream processing mongodb make life much easier. overall, quite pleased progress making new products. said before, natively bundling capability really reduces eliminates need customer bolt bunch different technology solve problem, saving lot time, money, cost, risk. brad sill -- analyst that's really exciting. thanks, dev. wanted ask question around cedric's appointment. focus may different leadership thinking going forward? thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer no, cedric cro for, gosh, like think like five, six years, -- interim cro three quarter took last made change really expansion responsibilities. known cedric long time. worked multiple different companies. think good barometer understanding sale leadership. there's number sale leader worked top-tier software company used work me. super-excited role cedric going take also making change cedric better align different organization tightly work together going up-market, app monetization positioning well ideal database genai apps. brad sill -- analyst super exciting. thanks, dev. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer thanks, brad. operator thank you. one moment next question, please. next question coming line mike cikos needham company. line open. mike cikos -- analyst hey guys, thanks taking question here. wanted come back consumption growth slightly better expectation second quarter row now. apology missed it, improvement seeing, across vintage geography potentially concentrated scope? trying get better understanding what's seeking place what's embedded guide. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. no, would describe broad-based, mike. obviously, pleased see continuing monitoring slicing dicing different ways. information insight you, share it. without trying throw whole bunch cold water mind, slightly better, step-function changed better, good see. mike cikos -- analyst terrific. maybe quick follow-up dev. think build maybe tyler's question top q&a, cited customer thinking workload holistically even looking run ai workload on-prem. much think function customer still trying figure optimize latency cost demonstration really early phase exploratory phase versus going production? way coarse two necessarily connected? thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer no, think kind little bit both. think customer committed running big part estate on-prem. definition, going build ai workload, run on-prem, mean also need access gpus that. customer leveraging basically renting gpus cloud provider building ai workloads. think very, early days. still learning, experimenting. more-and-more apps entering production. said prepared remarks, thousand workload -- ai workload running mongodb, small percentage demonstrated meaningful product market fit. initial traction kind still small. think people get sophisticated ai, ai technology matures becomes useful, think application -- start seeing application take-off. kind chuckled today see senior leader bragging chip using versus apps building. tell still very, early day big platform shift. mike cikos -- analyst great point. thank again, guys. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, mike. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line eric heath keybanc. line open. eric heath -- analyst hi, thanks taking question. dev, michael, sound like takeaway call greater focus ea enterprise. structurally rethink ea business differently think healthy double-digit growth business going forward foreseeable future? could ask follow-up question separate that. michael, understand still early identify fiscal '25 cohort workloads, curious high-level look feel like higher quality fiscal '24 cohort workflow. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer want take first one term ea... michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, mean, would say, mean, committed run anywhere strategy. said, first investing community many customer first way experience mongodb. want full experience integrating search vector search core product. gate really start building applications. transition building capability ea. so, clearly investing ea product. atlas still big, big part business big, big part growth engine typically launch new feature atlas capability already have, fact multi-cloud make very, compelling offering many customers. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. think term workloads, think early. reminder folks, tend start small, although grow quickly. think thing add is, pretty consistent pleased new business done. need time let cohort play track them. think like said, happy new business winning. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line william power baird. line open. brian raferty denyeau -- investor relation there, william? william power -- analyst sorry, yeah. thank you. dev, encouraging comment relational migrator. wonder could touch think driving higher interest here. mean, sound like ai contributing helping, great get color still feel like obviously meaningful long-term opportunity. maybe second part question dev michael, great get framework around professional service investments. way kind think quantification timing that? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. reason excited opportunity go legacy application that, one, seems like there's confluence event happening. one increasing cost tax supporting managing legacy apps going enough. second, many customer regulated industries, regulator calling -- fact running legacy apps systemic risk, longer kick road. third, also longer kick around, vendor going end-of-life, make decision migrate application modern tech stack. fourth, genai predicated data build competitive advantage, need leverage proprietary data, people want access data able easily. that's another reason want modernize. also people built application retiring longer firm, creates risk companies. given that, customer incredibly interested figuring way easily safely securely migrate -- applications. always could help easily move data map schema relational schema document schema. hardest part essentially rewriting application. advent genai, significantly reduce time. one, use genai analyze existing code. two, use genai reverse engineer test test code does. three, use genai build new code user test ensure new code produce result old code. time effort suddenly cut meaningful way that's suddenly creating lot interest customer saying, goodness. already relational app, moving another relational app feel like modernization. so, advantage moving mongodb give much modern platform, much agile, flexible, performant, scalable platform future needs. that's excited. again, early days. run number pilot gone well. process working customer migration process. take time very, complex applications. actually, one thing also mentioned going -- saying go tertiary tier 2 tier 3 application, saying, hey, want look crown jewel apps painful us. that's also exciting. again, take time, committed this, think going drive -- help u drive long-term -- meaningful long-term growth. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, will. last part question professional service investment, really building capacity order meet demand seeing relative opportunity. calling particular gross margin impact that's typically show up. maybe last thing probably obvious, sort underscore reason though arr, right, drive new workloads, additional workload mongodb part migration. time, talked before, hope expect able leverage technology more, least initially medium-term, there's going healthy human/services component that. wanted sort effectively telegraph folks. william power -- analyst that's helpful. thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, will. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line rudy kessinger da davidson. please go ahead. rudy kessinger -- analyst hey guys, thanks squeezing here. believe last quarter said consumption growth slightly ahead expectations. slower year-over-year growth versus q2 last year, year-over-year growth improve q1. so, guess curious q3, could make comment regard? obviously, slower year-over-year basis q3 last year, stable year-over-year consumption growth q2 better worse? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. rudy, thanks question. specifically called relative q2. see lower year-over-year growth called out. see seasonal rebound. usually q3 stronger q2 talked smaller prior year. hopefully, help triangulate. rudy kessinger -- analyst okay. quick follow-up. believe q4 call back march. point, dev, said would least another year ai application deployed scale. sound like commentary early large workloads, thousands, many large scale. guess, expectation maybe still least another year seeing broad ai application rollouts scale? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. think lot function what's happening r&d side ai, right? example, today, compelling model designed phones, right, today phone computing horsepower run complex models. so, see ton very, successful consumer apps besides, say, chatgpt claude. -- also see like hundred apps taking like saw kind first generation like internet cloud era, right, mobile era. like think still early day ai. see lot people building ai apps, lot kind fairly rudimentary functionality. think time that's going change. fact, know change. can't predict happen. see apps production, traction, seeing grow very, quickly lot platform. really meaningful. operator thank you. concludes today's q&a session. would like go ahead turn call back dev closing remarks. please go ahead. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thank you, everyone. wanted say really pleased q3 result strong new business performance revenue exceeding expectation -- across atlas ea. making necessary investment expand enterprise channel see largest opportunity establish mongodb standard strongest return go-to-market investments. looking ahead, encouraged progress making accelerating legacy app modernization ai well establishing standard emerging ai tech stack greenfield ai applications. last least, would like thank michael contribution past 10 year wish well. thank you, everyone, talk soon. operator [operator

Welcome to the MongoDB third-quarter fiscal year 2025 conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there'll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your speaker for today, Brian Denyeau. Please go ahead. Brian Raferty Denyeau -- Investor Relations Thank you, Lisa. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today to review MongoDB's third-quarter fiscal 2025 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued after the close of the market today. Joining me the call today are Dev Ittycheria, president and CEO of MongoDB; and Michael Gordon, MongoDB's COO and CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our market and future growth opportunities, our expectations for the macroeconomic environment in fiscal 2025 and the impact of AI, the benefits of our product platform, our competitive landscape, customer behaviors, our financial guidance, and our planned investments in growth opportunities in AI. These statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including the results of operations and financial condition that cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. For a discussion of the material risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please refer to the risks described in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 31st, 2024 that we filed with the SEC on August 30th, 2024. Any forward-looking statements made on this call reflect our views only as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them except as required by law. Additionally, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures on this conference call. Please refer to the tables in our earnings release in the Investor Relations portion of our website for a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dev. Dev? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we had a strong quarter of new business and executed well against our large market opportunity. Let's begin by reviewing our third quarter results before giving you a broader company update. We generated revenue of $529 million, a 22% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew 26% year-over-year, representing 68% of total revenue. We generated non-GAAP operating income of $101 million for a 19% non-GAAP operating margin and we ended the quarter with over 52,600 customers. Overall, we were pleased with our performance in the third quarter. We had a strong new business quarter and we're happy with our new workload acquisition on Atlas. Our non-Atlas business significantly exceeded expectations in part because we benefited from a few large multi-year deals as customers continue to value our run anywhere strategy and want to build a deeper longer-term relationship with MongoDB. Atlas consumption was slightly better than expected in a macro-environment that we would characterize as largely consistent with what we saw in the first half of the year. Michael will cover consumption trends in more detail. Retention rates remained strong in Q3, demonstrating the mission criticality of our platform. On our Q1 earnings call, we shared with you the three major strategic initiatives that we believe will enable us to maximize our long-term opportunity. I want to give you an update on the progress we're making on those initiatives. First, we are increasing our investment in the enterprise channel since we see the strongest returns in this part of the market. Specifically, we're expanding our strategic account program going to next year, as we see more accounts that will benefit from incremental investment. In addition, we're investing time and resources to educate developers in large enterprise accounts and uplevel their MongoDB skills. These organizations have thousands of developers and as we penetrate them more deeply, we encounter developers who have historically only built SQL applications and simply do not know how to use MongoDB to its full potential. In our experience, educating these developers on the benefits of MongoDB drives significant incremental adoption of our platform. To fund these up-market investments, we are reallocating a portion of our mid-market investments. The mid-market remains an attractive opportunity for us, but we believe that prioritizing investment up-market will deliver strong returns in the current environment. We also believe there are additional ways to serve the mid-market more efficiently through our self-serve channel and other scaled technology-enabled sales and customer service motions. Second, we are optimistic about the opportunity to accelerate legacy app modernization using AI and are investing more in this area. As you recall, we ran a few successful pilots earlier this year, demonstrating that AI tooling combined with professional services and our relational migrator product can significantly reduce the time, cost, and risk of migrating legacy applications onto MongoDB. While it's early days, we have observed a more than 50% reduction in the cost to modernize. On the back of these strong early results, additional customer interest is exceeding our expectations. Large enterprises in every industry and geography are experiencing acute pain from their legacy infrastructure and are eager for more agile, performant, and cost-effective solutions. Not only are customers excited to engage with us, they also want to focus on some of the most important applications in their enterprise, further demonstrating the level of interest and size of the long-term opportunity. As relational applications encompass a wide variety of database types, programming languages, versions, and other customer-specific variables, we expect modernization projects to continue to include meaningful service engagements in the short and medium term. Consequently, we're increasing our professional services delivery capabilities, both directly and through partners. In the long run, we expect to automate and simplify large parts of the modernization process. To that end, we are leveraging the learnings from early service engagement to develop new tools to accelerate future modernization efforts. Although it's early days and scaling our legacy app modernization capabilities will take time, we have increased conviction that this motion will significantly add to our growth in the long term. Third, we are investing to capitalize on our inherent technical advantages as a key component of the emerging AI tech stack. As a reminder, MongoDB is uniquely equipped to query rich and complex data structures typical of AI applications. The ability of a database to query rich and complex data structures is crucial because AI applications often rely on highly detailed, interrelated, and nuanced data to make accurate predictions and decisions. For example, a recommendation system doesn't just analyze a single customer's purchase but also considers their browsing history, peer group behavior, and product categories requiring a database that can query and interlink these complex data structures. In addition, MongoDB's architecture unifies source data, metadata, operational data, and vector data in an all-in-one platform, updating the need for multiple database systems and complex back-end architectures. This enables a more compelling developer experience than any other alternative. From what we see in the AI market today, most customers are still in the experimental stage as they work to understand the effectiveness of the underlying tech stack and build early proof-of-concept applications. However, we are seeing an increasing number of AI apps in production. Today, we have thousands of AI apps on our platform. What we don't yet see is many of these apps actually achieving meaningful product market fit and therefore significant traction. In fact, as you take a step back and look at the entire universe of AI apps, a very small percentage of them have achieved the type of scale that we commonly see with enterprise-specific applications. We do have some AI apps that are growing quickly, including one that is already a seven-figure workload that has grown 10 times since the beginning of the year. Similar to prior platform shifts as the usefulness of AI tech improves and becomes more cost-effective, we will see the emergence of many more AI apps that do nail product market fit, but it's difficult to predict when that will happen more broadly. We remain confident that we will capture our fair share of these successful AI applications as we see that our platform is popular with developers building more sophisticated AI use cases. We continue investing in our product capabilities, including enterprise-grade Atlas Vector Search functionality to build on this momentum and even better position MongoDB to capture the AI opportunity. In addition, as previously announced, we are bringing search and vector service to our community and EA offerings, leveraging our run anywhere competitive advantage in the world of AI. Finally, we are expanding our MongoDB AI applications program or MAAP, which helps enterprise customers build and bring AI applications into production by providing them with reference architectures, integrations with leading tech providers, and coordinated services and support. Last week, we announced a new code of partners including McKinsey, Confluent, Capgemini, and Unstructured, as well as the collaboration with Meta to enable developers to build AI-enriched applications on MongoDB using Llama. Next, I'd like to provide you with a brief product update. At our dot local developer conference in London in October, we announced the general availability of MongoDB 8.0, the fastest and most performant version of MongoDB ever. MongoDB 8.0 performs 20% to 60% better against common industry benchmarks compared to our prior version and is built to exceed our customers' most stringent security, resiliency, availability, and performance requirements. To best serve our customers, we regularly review and reprioritize investments in our product portfolio to ensure we're allocating our resources to products with the highest demand from our customers. And to do that, we also deprecate products that are not showing results we desired. Consequently, we made the decision to consolidate our Atlas serverless offerings with our smallest dedicated tiers to create Atlas Flex customers, a new offering with a simpler architecture that provides the elasticity features akin to serverless. We will begin migrating effective customers to the single, simple, entry-level solution in Q4. We also decided to deprecate Atlas DeviceSync and other capabilities not widely adopted in order to focus our engineering resources on the core platform. While these reprioritization decisions are not made lightly, they allow us to deliver the most value to the largest number of customers, reinforcing our commitment to being the best modern database and helping us to grow faster. Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the adoption trends of MongoDB across our customer base. Customers across industries and around the world are running mission-critical projects in MongoDB Atlas, leveraging the full power of our developer data platform, including Financial Times, CarGurus, and Victoria's Secret. As part of the digital transformation journey, global specialty retailer Victoria's Secret & Company migrated its e-commerce platform to MongoDB Atlas. As a fully managed platform, MongoDB Atlas allowed the company to simplify its architecture and improve performance, supporting the retailer to provide a resilient, secure, and fast web and mobile e-commerce experience for their millions of customers around the world. Allianz, Alphamad, Swiss Post, and Paylocity are turning to MongoDB to modernize applications. Paylocity, a leading provider of cloud-based payroll and human capital management software, selected MongoDB to power proprietary application aimed at fostering employee connections and engagement. When traffic increased and the original SQL-based solution was unable to keep up with the required performance metrics, Paylocity migrated to MongoDB Atlas to take advantage of the flexible schema architecture, performance, and scalability. MongoDB costs five times less than the previous SQL database solution and the company's developers can now create an application within minutes, something that used to take weeks. Mature companies and start-ups alike are using MongoDB to help deliver the next wave of AI-powered application to customers, including NerdWallet, Cisco, and Tealbook. Tealbook, a supplier intelligence platform, migrated from Postgres, pgvector, and ElasticSearch to MongoDB to eliminate technical debt and consolidate their tech stack. The company experienced workload isolation and scalability issues in pgvector and were concerned with the search index inconsistencies, which were all resolved with the migration to MongoDB. With Atlas Vector search and dedicated search nodes, Tealbook has realized improved cost-efficiency and increased scalability for the supplier data platform, an application that uses GenAI to collect, verify, and enrich supplier data across various sources. In summary, we had a healthy Q3 with both Atlas and EA exceeding expectations. We saw a strong new business quarter and we remain confident in our ability to become an increasing strategic provider in our large and growing market. Looking forward, we see a great opportunity to grow our adoption in the enterprise through new workloads, modernizing legacy applications, and winning the next generation of AI-powered applications. I would like to finish by providing an update on our senior leadership. First, as we announced early in the press release, after nearly 10 years, Michael Gordon has made the decision to leave MongoDB. Michael has been instrumental in MongoDB's success over the past decade, leading our successful IPO, helping us grow our revenue nearly 50-fold, and scaling -- and successfully scaling our business model to generate meaningful operating leverage. He has been a trusted advisor and business partner to the Board and me over the years and also has become a personal friend. Michael is excited to take a well-deserved break. We have commenced the search for Michael's replacement and will be evaluating both internal and external candidates. One of Michael's proudest compliments -- accomplishments has been building a world-class finance team under his leadership, and I'm confident that we will not miss a beat during this transition. Michael will continue to serve as CFO through January 31st to help us finish the fiscal year and then will transition to an Advisor to the company to ensure a seamless process. If we have not named Michael's successor by fiscal year-end, Serge Tanjga, SVP of Finance, will serve as Interim CFO, beginning on February 1st. Second, we are promoting Cedric Pech, currently our chief revenue officer to the newly created role of president worldwide field operations. In this new position, Cedric will oversee all our field-based customer-facing and go-to-market enablement teams, including professional services. We believe this org structure will best enable us to execute on some of the key strategic initiatives I discussed earlier, in particular, our increased focus on up-market and the app monetization opportunity. I would like to congratulate Cedric on this well-deserved promotion. With that, let me turn the call over to Michael. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Dev, and thanks for the kind words and our incredible partnership over the past decade. The past 10 years have been the most rewarding in my professional career and I'm extremely proud of what we've achieved together and of course, to the whole MongoDB team. With as much success as we had, I still believe that MongoDB is in the early stages of realizing its full potential as it continues to take share in one of the largest markets in software. Now, turning to the results for the quarter. I'll begin with a detailed review of our third-quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025. First, I'll start with our third quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $529.4 million, up 22% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance. Shifting to our product mix, Atlas grew 26% in the quarter compared to the previous year and now represents 68% of total revenue compared to 66% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and 71% last quarter. We recognized Atlas revenue primarily based on customer consumption of our platform and that consumption is closely tied to end user activity of their applications. Let me provide some context on Atlas consumption in the quarter. In Q3, consumption was slightly ahead of our expectations. This year's Q3 seasonal improvement was more muted than in years past as expected. On a year-over-year basis, consumption growth remains below that of prior year period. Turning to non-Atlas revenue. Non-Atlas came in significantly ahead of our expectations. As Dev mentioned, EA new business was strong, and we continue to have success selling incremental workloads into our existing customer base. In addition, our Q3 non-Atlas revenue benefited from a few large multi-year deals. As you know, due to ASC 606, we recognized the entire term license component of a multi-year contract at the start of that contract. Compared to Q3 of last year, the multi-year license component of non-Atlas revenues was over $15 million higher. Turning to customer growth. During the third quarter, we grew our customer base by approximately 1,900 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 52,600, which is up from over 46,400 in the year-ago period. Of our total customer count, over 7,400 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 6,900 in the year-ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven primarily by Atlas, which had over 51,100 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 44,900 in the year-ago period. It is important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers adding their first Atlas workload. Continuing on, in Q3, our net ARR expansion rate was approximately 120%. We ended the quarter with 2,314 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, up from $1,972 in the year-ago period. Moving down the income statement, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the third quarter was $405.7 million, representing a gross margin of 77%, which is flat versus the year-ago period. Our income from operations was $101.5 million or 19% operating margin for the third quarter compared to an 18% operating margin in the year-ago period. The primary reason for more favorable operating income results versus guidance is our revenue outperformance, including the very high margin multi-year license revenue benefit. Net income in the third quarter was $98.1 million or $1.16 per share, based on 84.2 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a net income of $79.1 million or $0.96 per share on 83.7 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding in the year-ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the third quarter with $2.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $37.4 million. After taking into consideration approximately $2.9 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was $34.6 million in the quarter. This compares to free cash flow of $35 million in the year-ago period. In Q3, we did not incur capital expenditures to purchase IPV4 addresses as we previously expected, but we did start making those purchases in November and still expect a total outlay of $20 million to $25 million this fiscal year as we previously communicated. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $515 million to $519 million. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $55 million to $58 million and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.65 based on 84.9 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. For the full-fiscal year 2025, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.973 billion to $1.977 billion, non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $242 million to $245 million, and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $3.01 to $3.03 based on 84 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. Note that the non-GAAP net income per share guidance for the fourth-quarter and full-fiscal year 2025 includes a non-GAAP tax provision of approximately 20%. I'll now provide some more context around our updated guidance. First, in terms of Atlas consumption, we expect to see a typical seasonal slowdown in Q4, driven by underlying application usage moderating during the holiday season. Second, since Atlas consumption remained lower on a year-over-year basis in Q3, we expect to see continued deceleration of Atlas year-over-year growth in Q4. Third, we expect to see a sequential decline in non-Atlas revenue in Q4, which is contrary to our normal pattern. The reason for this is that we experienced a significant additional benefit from multi-year deals in Q3, which we do not expect to recur in Q4. In addition, I want to provide some incremental color on some of our recent product and -- how some of our recent product and go-to-market changes will impact the growth of our reported customer count going forward. First, as Dev explained, we are reallocating a portion of our go-to-market resources from the mid-market to the enterprise channel. As a result, we expect to see significantly fewer mid-market direct sales customer net additions and as a result, slower direct sales customer growth going forward. We believe this reallocation of investment dollars will drive higher revenue growth over time. So, it's a trade-off that makes sense. Second, as we introduce Atlas Flex clusters in Q4 and automatically migrate customers in Q1, we expect to see a one-time negative impact to our customer count since we have approximately 4,000 serverless customers who are very low spending and we do not expect them to transition over to Flex. These customers have a negligible impact on our revenue but will impact our reported customer count. To summarize, we're pleased with our third quarter results and especially our ability to win new business. We have a small share in one of the largest and fastest-growing markets in all of software with a number of secular tailwinds, including AI at our back. We'll continue investing judiciously and focusing on our execution to capture this long-term opportunity. With that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator? Questions & Answers: Operator [Operator instructions] Our first question for the day will be coming from Sanjit Singh of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Thank you for taking the questions and congrats, Michael, on outstanding career. You had an absolutely fantastic run at MongoDB. I'm excited to see what you do next, or excited if you just take a breather. So congrats, Michael. I guess to take the question -- to start off with the questions, when we look at what Atlas has been doing in the past two quarters, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think consumption is coming in at least modestly ahead of your expectations. Relative to what we've seen at the beginning of the year, what sort of -- is it a function of sales execution? Is it a function of the end-user activity sort of improving? What's driving at least the improvement in Atlas consumption in the past two quarters? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So a few different things. So I think if you look at our outlook at the beginning of the year, we had indicated that we thought we would see stable Atlas growth from a consumption standpoint. What we've seen and what we've talked about is -- we've actually seen lower year-over-year growth based on the underlying consumption. And so -- and that's incorporated into our Q4 guide. We have seen the Q3 and Q4 be -- sorry, Q2 and Q3, excuse me, be better than our expectations, but it's still down on a year-over-year basis. And so I want to make sure that we're not sort of confusing the comparative set of year-over-year versus relative to our expectations. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Understood. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer And the core of it, Sanjit, to your question is really the underlying usage of the applications. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Yeah, that makes total sense. And then, Dev, I have to ask you the AI agent question. In terms of an AI agent needing more context, it has going to have a set of tools to take its actions. What does it mean for MongoDB as an operational data store as customers start to roll out more agentic applications? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, just to talk about agents, I think when you think about agents, there's jobs, there's -- sorry, there's a job, there's projects and then there's task. Right now, the agents that are being rolled out are really focused on task like say something from Sierra or some other companies are rolling out agents. But you're right, what they deemed to do is to deal with being able to create a rich and complex data structures. Now why is this important for AI is that AI models don't just look at isolated data points, but they need to understand relationships, hierarchies, and patterns within the data. They need to be able to essentially get real-time insights. For example, if you have a chatbot where someone is querying, a customer is kind of trying to get some update on the order they placed five minutes ago because they may have not gotten any confirmation, your chatbot needs to be able to deal with real-time information. You need to be able to deal with basically handling very advanced use cases, understanding like, to do things like fraud detection to understand behaviors of supply chains, you need to understand intricate data relationships. All these things are consistent with MongoDB offers. And so we believe that at the end of the day, we are well-positioned to handle this. And the other thing that I would say is that we've embedded in a very natural way of search and vector search. So we're just not an OLTP database, we do tech search and vector search. That's all one experience and no other platform offers that, and we think we have a real advantage. And so we're integrated with the leading AI frameworks and platforms. We have enterprise-grade security and compliance, and customers can run us anywhere, either on 118 cloud regions or on-prem, and that again is a huge differentiator for us. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Awesome. Appreciate the thoughts, Dev. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Sanjit. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Taylor -- Tyler Radke of Citi. Your line is open. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Hi, thank you very much for taking the question. And, Michael, all the best, and congratulations on 10 years. Going back to the sales execution, I mean, one of the things that you talked about earlier this year was some challenges just in terms of the recently acquired workloads ramping. And I think a lot of those were from the past fiscal year. So curious how the quality of workload acquisition has trended this year. And as you think about the ramp in consumption potential into next year, how does that sort of look versus this time a year ago? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Maybe I'll just talk about what we're doing and the changes we made and then Michael can talk a little bit about the consumption trends. So, we did make some changes at the beginning of the year, and we really wanted to focus on both the volume and the quality of the workloads and there were some slight adjustments that we made. We think those changes are having a reasonable positive impact. Again, it's too early to declare victory because these workloads usually start small and grow over time, but we're really pleased with the results we're seeing so far. And -- but again, it's early days. And obviously, we'll know about the fiscal '25 workloads as we go into fiscal '26. But so far, so good. Michael, on consumption? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, just a couple of things, and thanks, Tyler. The fiscal '24 cohorts that we called out earlier, that slower growth does continue. They've been in line with our revised expectations. We made some changes that we talked about at the -- earlier in the year that should affect the fiscal '25 cohorts, but it's just too early to tell. On those, we need a few more quarters of data before you can really see if we're -- how we're seeing those behave differently. I will say we've talked about the new business environment and our success in new business. We have been pleased with that, but that just shows kind of the initial piece, and we need to see how they grow and how those cohorts evolve. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Great. Thanks. And follow-up on the EA side, you talked about the outsized strength in non-Atlas business this quarter. Maybe if you could unpack like the relative upside that was driven by simply duration versus new business. I know you called out the duration impact year-over-year, but are -- do you feel like this was sort of a one-off or do you feel like maybe some of your bigger customers are indexing more toward EA and how does that impact the way you think about the product and introducing things like vector search and stream processing onto the on-prem product? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, thank you. So overall, we continue to find the EA product resonate with customers. It's an important part of the run anywhere strategy and we've continued to see success with that and people wanting to increase their investment in MongoDB. There's always been a multiyear component and we continue to see that. We talked about that at the beginning of the year as to how fiscal '24 had an abnormally high amount of multi-year benefit and therefore, we were anticipating that being a headwind and we quantified that in roughly the $40 million range. What we talked about on this call earlier is we saw from a few large accounts, a surprising amount of multiyear that positively benefited Q3 at a little more than $15 million in revenue compared to what we saw Q3 a year ago. So, not as much of a headwind as we had been expecting. Obviously, with the 606 dynamics, some of these things, especially for a large deal can be kind of meaty and chunky and lumpy, which is why we try and call it out and sort of help people understand, but there's a pretty healthy kind of baseline flow, not just of EA, but also of multiyear. And when we see spikes, we just try and call it out for you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I just want to add, Tyler, that we are investing in our what we call our EA business. First, we're starting by investing with search and vector search and a community product. That does a couple of things for us. One, whenever anyone starts with MongoDB with the open-source product, they immediately get all the benefits of that complete highly integrated platform. Two, those capabilities will then migrate to EA. So, EA for us is an investment strategy. We definitely see lots of large customers who are very, very committed to running workloads on-prem. We even see some customers want to run to run AI workloads on-prem. So, the optionality they get by using MongoDB to not just be on-prem and the cloud, but also cross-cloud is a very compelling one. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Brad Reback of Stifel. Your line is open. Brad Reback -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. And, Michael, best of luck. It's been a great run. Dev, you started the call talking about a bunch of investments, which are great given the growth of the business. And obviously, you talked about reallocating some expenses. But net-net, should we think about this incremental investment phase next year as gating margin upside? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think that's something that we obviously are not ready to talk about next year just now, but I would say that we -- the reason we're looking to invest and just to summarize again, going up-market on legacy app modernization where we see very large workloads potentially at play and being the ideal database for GenAI apps, which is the future as important investments to drive long-term growth. And we're quite energized by those investments and that's something that we have high conviction on. Brad Reback -- Analyst That's great. And then on the MAAP program, are most of those workloads going to wind up in Atlas or will that be a healthy combination of EA and Atlas? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think it's again early days. I would say -- I would probably say more on the side of Atlas and EA in the early days. I think once we introduce a search and vector search into the EA product, you'll see more of that on-prem. Obviously, people can use MongoDB for AI workloads using other technologies as well in conjunction with MongoDB for on-prem AI use cases. But I would say you're probably going to see that happen first in Atlas. Brad Reback -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Jason Ader of William Blair. Your line is open. Jason Ader -- Analyst Yeah, thank you. I'm not going to belabor congratulating Michael, but it has been it has been fun working with you and best of luck. The question I had is on the strength in EA. Do you think, Dev, it represents a comment on how enterprises might be rethinking or reassessing the kind of on-prem versus cloud workload placement decision? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Well, when I think about large enterprises, I think large enterprises have meaningful workloads that are still running on-prem. I think the belief that everything would go to the cloud was probably something that was really popular in the good old days of Zurp. But I think now as customers assess their investments that they already have in place, they're being much more judicious about where they run those workloads and if they think they can leverage their existing investments in their own infrastructure, then they're going to do so. Also for a bunch of other reasons like regulatory reasons, some customers are quite not moving as aggressively to the cloud. We see that in particularly in Europe, where we see a lot of the European banks still running majority of the workloads on-prem. So it also varies by region where conversely in Asia, we're seeing people much move much more aggressively to the cloud. So I think it really depends on industry, on geography, and on the personal dynamics of what's happening in that particular account. I mean, we see some large US banks are also very committed to running things on-prem. So it really varies. And that's why we feel really good about our run anywhere strategy because it gives customer optionality. They can build something and run on-prem. And if and when they choose to move to the cloud, it's very easy to do so with MongoDB. Jason Ader -- Analyst All right. And then just as a follow-up also on the investments you're making in strategic sales and enterprise. Could you just get a little more specific on what those investments might be? Is it hiring a lot of new salespeople? Is it working more with SIs, investing more in SIs? Any additional detail would be helpful. Thanks. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So just for everyone's benefit, we've identified a number of accounts, which we call strategic accounts, which we think that have high upside for us. We've seen a number of accounts that grow very quickly when we deploy the right mix of resources. Now they're all not necessarily quota-carrying resources. They could be additional technical sales resources, additional PS resources, additional customer service resources to better service and support those accounts. We even do things like run education sessions for developers of the accounts, they're called either hackathons or like what we call developer days or even design reviews where we'll meet with our development teams who are looking to build an application, help them think about how they would potentially use MongoDB to build that particular app. And what we find is that because many of these developers, the experience with MongoDB is quite limited, the more we can engage with them, the more we can educate them and the more we can show them how simple and easy it is. Like for example, most customers today think like they have to use an OLTP database, then a search database, maybe a vector database, and then like a caching database. And all that is integrated in MongoDB. So all of a sudden, customers can say, wow, I can simplify my life, simplify my back-end infrastructure, build this app far more quickly and it will be much more easier to manage long-term if I do everything on MongoDB. And it's really a function of just educating them on the power of MongoDB that really opens up a lot of opportunities for us. So that's why we're doubling down, and the mix of resources is really predicated on the accounts, but it's not just quota counting resources, it's the whole suite of resources that we're bringing to the table. Jason Ader -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Andrew Nowinski of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Okay. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking the question and congrats on a nice quarter. You gave an example of a customer that migrated off Postgres and I think you said they had issues with their PG vector function. I was wondering how long was that customer using Postgres before they decided to make a change to Mongo, meaning was this some sort of like a rebound type customer where they chose PG -- or excuse me, Postgres and it didn't work? And then how frequently are you seeing this type of transition? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So I can't give you the specifics on how long they were using Postgres, but this is not -- this is a trend that we're seeing in our business. You have to remember Postgres is a 40-year-old technology. It's -- and they have been the beneficiary of people lifting and shifting from other types of relational databases, Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, et cetera. And they're an open-source database. And but as part -- because they're an open-source and relational database, they have the same inherent challenges all relational databases do. They're quite inflexible. So once you build a schema, it's very hard to change the schema. It's hard to scale and hard to distribute data. And if you have large data volumes, you have to do weird things like, for example, resort to off-road storage for large data objects, which creates performance bottlenecks. And so again, people default to Postgres if they don't know anything better because all they know is relational and everyone is kind of moving off those other relational platforms. And that's the whole point I was saying earlier. Once we educate developers on the flexibility of schema, how easily or horizontally scale the rich query language where you can do aggregations and do sophisticated geospatial indexes, the productivity gains by using the document model and how easy is to organize data, it's -- people are just like, wow, life is so much easier. Now I want to be clear, this is not a zero-sum game. Postgres does not have to fail for us to be successful. It's a big market and we're quite excited about the opportunity, but we do see customers moving off Postgres and coming to MongoDB. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Thank you. That was very helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up. If we normalize the $15 million multiyear deal impact you had in Q3, would EA still be down sequentially in Q4? Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer We haven't given that level of guidance, but just trying to help you understand in the context of the full-year numbers and the headwind that we talked about at the beginning of the year, just given the strength that we saw in Q3. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Got it. Thanks. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. The next question will be coming from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst Hey, thank you. And if you think about the EA strength this quarter, Michael, you'd kind of give us a little bit there. Like how should we think about renewal -- the renewal situation renewal pool coming up like or that you had in Q3, coming up in Q4, et cetera, as well and then like what does it mean in terms of upsell, cross-sell opportunity as people think about starting AI projects by self-serve, as you kind of mentioned earlier on the call? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So I think about -- if you think about EA for Q4, it tends to be a large renewal quarter, but what we're talking about in terms of the guide is because we had such strength in multiyear, that's where we would expect to see our EA down sequentially, which is not typically our pattern, which is why we called it out. In terms of AI workloads and some of those other things, I think it's early to tell and obviously, we'll continue to evolve and assess our view when we get to the full-year guide in March. And then we'll also have an updated view on how the cohorts are behaving and sort of how multiyear played out. But I think in terms of Q4, the comments that I made earlier hopefully will help. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst Yeah. Okay, perfect. And then the -- and can you talk a little bit about like obviously, there's a debate of like which database will be the persistent layer if you do AI projects, et cetera. What do you see from the big hyperscalers in terms of working with you guys and partnerships? We obviously just have AWS kind of summit, et-cetera. Can you speak a little bit like how your relationship with those big guys is evolving around this? And Michael, All the best in case I don't talk to you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, I'll start with the partnerships first, like our -- with AWS, as you said, they just had their re:Invent show last week. Our -- it remains very, very strong. We've closed a ton of deals this past quarter. Some of them very, very large deals. We're doing integrations to some of the new products like Q and Bedrock and the engagement in the field has been really strong. On Azure, I think we -- as I've shared in the past, we start-off with a little bit of a slow start, but in the words of the person who runs their partner leadership, the Azure MongoDB relationship has never been stronger. We've closed a large number of deals. We're part of what's called the Azure native IC service program and have a bunch of deep integrations with Azure, including Fabric, Power BI, Visual Studio, Semantic Kernel, and Azure OpenAI Studio. And we're also one of Azure's largest marketplace partners. And GCP does -- we have actually seen some uptick in terms of co-sales that we've done this past quarter and GCP made some comp changes where they -- that were favorable to working with MongoDB that we saw some results in the field, and we're focused on closing on -- closing a handful of large deals with GCP in Q4. So in general, I would say, things are going quite well. And then in terms of, I guess, implying your question was like the hyperscalers and are they potentially bundling things along with their AI offerings? I mean, candidly, since day one, the hyperscalers have been bundling their database offerings with every offering that they have and that's been their predominant strategy. And we've -- I think we've executed well against strategy because databases are not like a by-the-way decision. It's an important decision. And I think the hyperscalers are seeing our performance and realize it's better to partner with us. And as I said, customers understand the importance of the data layer, especially for AI applications. And so the partnership across all three hyperscalers is strong. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst OK, perfect. Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Raimo. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. The next question will be coming from the line of Brad Sills of Bank of America. Your line is open. Brad Sills -- Analyst Great. Thank you so much, and congratulations, Michael, on your next move. I wanted to ask about new workloads here on vector search, stream processing, relational migrator. Is there any one of those three that's ramping faster than maybe you expected? Just a little bit of color on how those new workload types are ramping. Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I'll kind of give you just a rundown of some of the -- I mean, essentially you're asking about the new products, like our -- on search, we introduced a new capability called Atlas search nodes, which where you can asymmetrically scale your search nodes because if you have a search-intensive use case, you don't have to scale all your nodes because they have become quite expensive. And we've seen that this kind of groundbreaking capability really well received. The demand is quite high and because customers like they can tune the configuration to the unique needs of their search requirements. One of the world's largest banks is using Atlas Search to provide like a Google-like search experience on payments data for massive corporate customers. So this is a customer-facing application and so performance, and scalability are critical. A leading provider of AI-powered accounting software uses Atlas Search to power its invoice analytics future, which allows end users and finance teams to perform ad-hoc analysis and easily find past-due invoices and voices that contain errors. So that search -- on vector search, it -- again, and it's been our kind of our first full-year since going generally available. And the product uptake has been actually very, very high. In Q3, we released quantization for Atlas Vector Search, which reduces the memory requirements by up to 96%, allowing us to support larger vector workloads with vastly improved price performance. For example, a multinational news organization created a GenAI powered tool designed to help producers and journalists efficiently search, summarize, and verify information from vast and varied data sources. A leading security firm is using Atlas Vector Search to fight AI fraud and a leading global media company replaced elastic search with hybrid search and vector search use case for a user recommendation engine that's built to suggest -- that's built in to suggest articles to end users. And so that's super exciting to see as well. We're also seeing a lot of interest in our streaming product, demand is very high. We just rolled it out to another hyperscaler, and customers are commenting on that the use cases of being able to embed stream processing with MongoDB makes our life so much easier. So overall, we're quite pleased with the progress we're making on the new products. And as I said before, natively bundling all these capabilities really reduces or eliminates the need for customers to have to bolt on a bunch of different technologies to solve the same problem, saving them a lot of time, money, cost, and risk. Brad Sills -- Analyst That's really exciting. Thanks, Dev. And then I wanted to ask a question around Cedric's appointment. Any focus that may be different here under his leadership that we should be thinking about going forward? Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer No, Cedric has been our CRO for, gosh, now like I think like five, six years, and he -- I was the Interim CRO for about three quarters until he took over when we last made a change and this is really an expansion of his responsibilities. I've known Cedric for a long time. He and I have worked with at multiple different companies. I think I have a good barometer for understanding sales leadership. There's a number of sales leaders who worked at other top-tier software companies who used to work for me or with me. And so I'm super-excited by the role Cedric is going to take and then we're also making some changes under Cedric to better align the different organizations so that we can more tightly work together on going up-market, on app monetization and positioning ourselves well to be the ideal database for GenAI apps. Brad Sills -- Analyst Super exciting. Thanks, Dev. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Brad. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question, please. Our next question will be coming from the line of Mike Cikos of Needham and Company. Your line is open. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Hey guys, thanks for taking the question here. I just wanted to come back to the consumption growth being slightly better than expectations again for the second quarter in a row now. And apologies if I missed it, but this improvement that we're seeing, is this across all vintages and geographies or is it potentially more concentrated in scope? Just trying to get a better understanding of what's seeking place out there and what's embedded in the guide. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. No, I would describe it as broad-based, Mike. And obviously, we're pleased to see it and we're continuing monitoring and slicing and dicing it in different ways. And as we have information or insights to you, we'll share it. And without trying to throw a whole bunch of cold water on our mind, it was slightly better, or a step-function changed better, but good to see. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Terrific. And maybe for a quick follow-up for Dev. I think it builds off maybe Tyler's question at the top of the Q&A, but you had cited that some customers are thinking about their workloads more holistically and even looking to run AI workloads on-prem. How much of that do you think is just a function of customers are still trying to figure out how to optimize for latency and cost or is this more a demonstration of we really are in the early phases of the exploratory phase versus going into production? Is there any way to coarse that out or is the two not necessarily connected? Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer No, I think it's kind of a little bit of both. I think you have some customers who are very committed to running a big part of the estate on-prem. So by definition, then if they're going to build an AI workload, it has to be run on-prem, which means that they also need access to GPUs and they're doing that. And then other customers are leveraging basically renting GPUs from the cloud providers and building their own AI workloads. I do think we're in the very, very early days. They're still learning, experimenting. More-and-more apps are entering production. And as I said on the prepared remarks, we have thousands of workload -- AI workloads running on MongoDB, but a very small percentage of them have demonstrated meaningful product market fit. And so the initial traction is kind of still small. But I think as people get more sophisticated with AI, as the AI technology matures and becomes more and more useful, I think applications will -- you'll start seeing these applications take-off. I kind of chuckled that today I see more senior leaders bragging about the chips they're using versus the apps they're building. So it just tells you that we're still in the very, very early days of this big platform shift. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Great point. Thank you again, guys. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Mike. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Eric Heath of KeyBanc. Your line is open. Eric Heath -- Analyst Hi, thanks for taking the question. Dev, Michael, it sounds like the takeaway from the call is a greater focus on EA and on enterprise. So should we structurally rethink the EA business differently and think of this more as a healthy double-digit growth business going forward for the foreseeable future? And then if I could just ask a follow-up question separate to that. But Michael, I understand that it's still early to identify the fiscal '25 cohort of workloads, but just curious at a high-level if they look and feel like of higher quality than the fiscal '24 cohort of workflow. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Do you want to take on the first one in terms of EA... Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, I mean, I would say, I mean, we are very committed to our run anywhere strategy. And as I said, we are first investing in community where for many customers is the first way they experience MongoDB. And we want them to have the full experience of integrating search and Vector search into our core product. And so they can out of the gate really start building applications. That will then transition to building those capabilities into EA. So, we are clearly investing in the EA product. But Atlas is still a big, big part of our business and a big, big part of our growth engine and we typically launch new features on Atlas and because of the capabilities we already have, the fact it's multi-cloud makes it a very, very compelling offering for many customers. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. And I think in terms of the workloads, I do think it's early. Just as a reminder for folks, they tend to start small, although grow quickly. I think the only other thing that I can add is, we've been pretty consistent and that we've been pleased with the new business that we've done. But we need some time to let the cohorts play out as we track them. But I think like I said, we've been happy with the new business that we were winning. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of William Power of Baird. Your line is open. Brian Raferty Denyeau -- Investor Relations You there, William? William Power -- Analyst Sorry, yeah. Thank you. Dev, you had some encouraging comments on relational migrator. I wonder if you could just touch on what you think is driving the higher interest here. I mean, it sounds like AI is contributing and helping, but it'd be great to get some more color there because that still feels like obviously a meaningful long-term opportunity. And then maybe the second part of the question for Dev or Michael, just be great to get any other framework around the professional services investments. Any way to kind of think about quantification and timing of that? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So the reason we're so excited about the opportunity to go after legacy applications is that, one, it seems like there's a confluence of events happening. One is that the increasing cost and tax of supporting and managing these legacy apps are just going up enough. Second, for many customers who are in regulated industries, the regulators are calling their -- the fact that they're running on these legacy apps with systemic risk, so they can no longer kick the can down the road. Third, also because they no longer can kick the can around, some vendors are going end-of-life, so they have to make a decision to migrate those applications to a more modern tech stack. Fourth, because GenAI is so predicated on data and to build a competitive advantage, you need to leverage your proprietary data, people want to access that data and be able to do so easily. And so that's another reason for them to want to modernize. And then you also have people who built those applications who are retiring or just no longer in the firm, so it just creates more and more risk for the companies. Given all that, customers are incredibly interested in figuring out a way to easily and safely and securely migrate those -- off those applications. And we always could help them very easily move the data and map the schema from a relational schema to a document schema. The hardest part was essentially rewriting the application. Now with the advent of GenAI, you can now significantly reduce the time. One, you can use GenAI to analyze existing code. Two, you can use GenAI to reverse engineer tests to test what the code does. And then three, you can use GenAI to build new code and then users test it to ensure that the new code produces the same results as the old code. And so all that time and effort is suddenly cut in a meaningful way and that's suddenly creating a lot of interest from customers saying, my goodness. And if you're already on a relational app, moving to another relational app doesn't feel like modernization. So, the other advantage is that moving to MongoDB gives them a much more modern platform, a much more agile, flexible, performant, and scalable platform for their future needs. And that's why we're so excited. Again, it's early days. We've run a number of pilots that have gone well. We're in the process of working with some customers now in the migration process. This will take time because these are very, very complex applications. And actually, one thing I also mentioned was that they're not just going after -- saying go after some tertiary Tier 2 or Tier 3 application, they're saying, hey, we want you to look at some of our crown jewels because these are the apps that are most painful for us. So that's also very exciting. But again, this will take time, but we're very committed to this, and we think this is going to drive -- help us drive long-term -- meaningful long-term growth. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, Will. And to the last part of your question on the professional services investment, we're really building out that capacity in order to meet the demand that we're seeing relative to the opportunity. We're calling it in particular because it has a gross margin impact because that's where that will typically show up. And then maybe the last thing and it's probably obvious, but just to sort of underscore it is the reason we're doing this though is for the ARR, right, to drive the new workloads, the additional workloads over to MongoDB as part of that migration. And over time, as we've talked about before, we hope and expect to be able to leverage technology more and more, but at least initially and into the medium-term, there's going to be a healthy human/services component to that. Just wanted to sort of effectively telegraph that out to folks. William Power -- Analyst That's helpful. Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Will. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Rudy Kessinger of DA Davidson. Please go ahead. Rudy Kessinger -- Analyst Hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in here. I believe last quarter you said consumption growth slightly ahead of expectations. And while down slower year-over-year growth versus Q2 last year, the year-over-year growth did improve from Q1. And so, I guess I'm curious for Q3, could you make a comment in that same regard? Obviously, slower on a year-over-year basis than Q3 last year, but was it stable with year-over-year consumption growth in Q2 or better or worse? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Rudy, thanks for the question. We haven't specifically called that out relative to Q2. We did see a lower year-over-year growth as we called out. We did see a seasonal rebound. Usually Q3 is stronger than Q2 and we talked about how that was smaller than in the prior year. So hopefully, that will help you all triangulate. Rudy Kessinger -- Analyst Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. I believe it was on your Q4 call back in March. At that point, Dev, you said it would be at least another year until AI applications are being deployed at scale. It sounds like the commentary that some early large workloads, but out of the thousands, just not many that are at large scale. I guess, is your expectation now that maybe it's still at least another year until we're seeing broad AI application rollouts at scale? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I think a lot of it's a function of the what's happening in the R&D side of AI, right? So for example, today, we don't have a very compelling model designed for our phones, right, because today the phones don't have the computing horsepower to run complex models. So, you don't see a ton of very, very successful consumer apps besides, say, ChatGPT or Claude. So we don't -- we also don't see like hundreds of apps taking off like you saw kind of the first generation of like the Internet or the cloud era, right, or the mobile era. So like I think we're still in the early days of AI. And so while we see a lot of people building AI apps, a lot of them have kind of fairly rudimentary functionality. But I think that over time that's going to change. In fact, I know it will change. I just can't predict when that will happen. But where we do see apps having production, we are having traction, we're seeing them grow very, very quickly and we have a lot of them on our platform. It's just very few of them are really have meaningful. Operator Thank you. And that concludes today's Q&A session. I would like to go ahead and turn the call back over to Dev for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, everyone. I just wanted to say we're really pleased with our Q3 results with strong new business performance and revenue exceeding expectations both -- across both Atlas and EA. We're making the necessary investments to expand our enterprise channel where we see the largest opportunity to establish MongoDB as a standard and the strongest returns on our go-to-market investments. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the progress we're making on both accelerating legacy app modernization with AI as well as establishing ourselves as a standard of the emerging AI tech stack for greenfield AI applications. And last but not least, I would like to thank Michael again for his contributions over the past 10 years and wish him well. Thank you, everyone, and we'll talk to you soon.

address previously expected, start making purchase november still expect total outlay $20 million $25 million fiscal year previously communicated. like turn outlook fourth quarter full fiscal year 2025. fourth quarter, expect revenue range $515 million $519 million. expect non-gaap income operation range $55 million $58 million non-gaap net income per share range $0.62 $0.65 based 84.9 million estimated diluted weighted-average share outstanding. full-fiscal year 2025, expect revenue range $1.973 billion $1.977 billion, non-gaap income operation range $242 million $245 million, non-gaap net income per share range $3.01 $3.03 based 84 million estimated diluted weighted-average share outstanding. note non-gaap net income per share guidance fourth-quarter full-fiscal year 2025 includes non-gaap tax provision approximately 20%. provide context around updated guidance. first, term atlas consumption, expect see typical seasonal slowdown q4, driven underlying application usage moderating holiday season. second, since atlas consumption remained lower year-over-year basis q3, expect see continued deceleration atlas year-over-year growth q4. third, expect see sequential decline non-atlas revenue q4, contrary normal pattern. reason experienced significant additional benefit multi-year deal q3, expect recur q4. addition, want provide incremental color recent product -- recent product go-to-market change impact growth reported customer count going forward. first, dev explained, reallocating portion go-to-market resource mid-market enterprise channel. result, expect see significantly fewer mid-market direct sale customer net addition result, slower direct sale customer growth going forward. believe reallocation investment dollar drive higher revenue growth time. so, trade-off make sense. second, introduce atlas flex cluster q4 automatically migrate customer q1, expect see one-time negative impact customer count since approximately 4,000 serverless customer low spending expect transition flex. customer negligible impact revenue impact reported customer count. summarize, pleased third quarter result especially ability win new business. small share one largest fastest-growing market software number secular tailwinds, including ai back. continue investing judiciously focusing execution capture long-term opportunity. that, like open questions. operator? question & answers: operator [operator instructions] first question day coming sanjit singh morgan stanley. line open. sanjit singh -- analyst thank taking question congrats, michael, outstanding career. absolutely fantastic run mongodb. excited see next, excited take breather. congrats, michael. guess take question -- start questions, look atlas past two quarters, correct wrong, think consumption coming least modestly ahead expectations. relative seen beginning year, sort -- function sale execution? function end-user activity sort improving? what's driving least improvement atlas consumption past two quarters? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. different things. think look outlook beginning year, indicated thought would see stable atlas growth consumption standpoint. seen talked -- actually seen lower year-over-year growth based underlying consumption. -- that's incorporated q4 guide. seen q3 q4 -- sorry, q2 q3, excuse me, better expectations, still year-over-year basis. want make sure sort confusing comparative set year-over-year versus relative expectations. sanjit singh -- analyst understood. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer core it, sanjit, question really underlying usage applications. sanjit singh -- analyst yeah, make total sense. then, dev, ask ai agent question. term ai agent needing context, going set tool take actions. mean mongodb operational data store customer start roll agentic applications? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. so, talk agents, think think agents, there's jobs, there's -- sorry, there's job, there's project there's task. right now, agent rolled really focused task like say something sierra company rolling agents. right, deemed deal able create rich complex data structures. important ai ai model look isolated data points, need understand relationships, hierarchies, pattern within data. need able essentially get real-time insights. example, chatbot someone querying, customer kind trying get update order placed five minute ago may gotten confirmation, chatbot need able deal real-time information. need able deal basically handling advanced use cases, understanding like, thing like fraud detection understand behavior supply chains, need understand intricate data relationships. thing consistent mongodb offers. believe end day, well-positioned handle this. thing would say embedded natural way search vector search. oltp database, tech search vector search. that's one experience platform offer that, think real advantage. integrated leading ai framework platforms. enterprise-grade security compliance, customer run u anywhere, either 118 cloud region on-prem, huge differentiator us. sanjit singh -- analyst awesome. appreciate thoughts, dev. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, sanjit. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line taylor -- tyler radke citi. line open. tyler radke -- analyst hi, thank much taking question. and, michael, best, congratulation 10 years. going back sale execution, mean, one thing talked earlier year challenge term recently acquired workload ramping. think lot past fiscal year. curious quality workload acquisition trended year. think ramp consumption potential next year, sort look versus time year ago? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. maybe talk change made michael talk little bit consumption trends. so, make change beginning year, really wanted focus volume quality workload slight adjustment made. think change reasonable positive impact. again, early declare victory workload usually start small grow time, really pleased result seeing far. -- again, early days. obviously, know fiscal '25 workload go fiscal '26. far, good. michael, consumption? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, couple things, thanks, tyler. fiscal '24 cohort called earlier, slower growth continue. line revised expectations. made change talked -- earlier year affect fiscal '25 cohorts, early tell. those, need quarter data really see -- seeing behave differently. say talked new business environment success new business. pleased that, show kind initial piece, need see grow cohort evolve. tyler radke -- analyst great. thanks. follow-up ea side, talked outsized strength non-atlas business quarter. maybe could unpack like relative upside driven simply duration versus new business. know called duration impact year-over-year, -- feel like sort one-off feel like maybe bigger customer indexing toward ea impact way think product introducing thing like vector search stream processing onto on-prem product? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah, thank you. overall, continue find ea product resonate customers. important part run anywhere strategy continued see success people wanting increase investment mongodb. there's always multiyear component continue see that. talked beginning year fiscal '24 abnormally high amount multi-year benefit therefore, anticipating headwind quantified roughly $40 million range. talked call earlier saw large accounts, surprising amount multiyear positively benefited q3 little $15 million revenue compared saw q3 year ago. so, much headwind expecting. obviously, 606 dynamics, things, especially large deal kind meaty chunky lumpy, try call sort help people understand, there's pretty healthy kind baseline flow, ea, also multiyear. see spikes, try call you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. want add, tyler, investing call ea business. first, starting investing search vector search community product. couple thing us. one, whenever anyone start mongodb open-source product, immediately get benefit complete highly integrated platform. two, capability migrate ea. so, ea u investment strategy. definitely see lot large customer very, committed running workload on-prem. even see customer want run run ai workload on-prem. so, optionality get using mongodb on-prem cloud, also cross-cloud compelling one. tyler radke -- analyst thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line brad reback stifel. line open. brad reback -- analyst great. thanks much. and, michael, best luck. great run. dev, started call talking bunch investments, great given growth business. obviously, talked reallocating expenses. net-net, think incremental investment phase next year gating margin upside? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer think that's something obviously ready talk next year now, would say -- reason looking invest summarize again, going up-market legacy app modernization see large workload potentially play ideal database genai apps, future important investment drive long-term growth. quite energized investment that's something high conviction on. brad reback -- analyst that's great. maap program, workload going wind atlas healthy combination ea atlas? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer think early days. would say -- would probably say side atlas ea early days. think introduce search vector search ea product, see on-prem. obviously, people use mongodb ai workload using technology well conjunction mongodb on-prem ai use cases. would say probably going see happen first atlas. brad reback -- analyst great. thanks much. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line jason ader william blair. line open. jason ader -- analyst yeah, thank you. going belabor congratulating michael, fun working best luck. question strength ea. think, dev, represents comment enterprise might rethinking reassessing kind on-prem versus cloud workload placement decision? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer well, think large enterprises, think large enterprise meaningful workload still running on-prem. think belief everything would go cloud probably something really popular good old day zurp. think customer assess investment already place, much judicious run workload think leverage existing investment infrastructure, going so. also bunch reason like regulatory reasons, customer quite moving aggressively cloud. see particularly europe, see lot european bank still running majority workload on-prem. also varies region conversely asia, seeing people much move much aggressively cloud. think really depends industry, geography, personal dynamic what's happening particular account. mean, see large u bank also committed running thing on-prem. really varies. that's feel really good run anywhere strategy give customer optionality. build something run on-prem. choose move cloud, easy mongodb. jason ader -- analyst right. follow-up also investment making strategic sale enterprise. could get little specific investment might be? hiring lot new salespeople? working sis, investing sis? additional detail would helpful. thanks. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. everyone's benefit, identified number accounts, call strategic accounts, think high upside us. seen number account grow quickly deploy right mix resources. necessarily quota-carrying resources. could additional technical sale resources, additional p resources, additional customer service resource better service support accounts. even thing like run education session developer accounts, called either hackathons like call developer day even design review meet development team looking build application, help think would potentially use mongodb build particular app. find many developers, experience mongodb quite limited, engage them, educate show simple easy is. like example, customer today think like use oltp database, search database, maybe vector database, like caching database. integrated mongodb. sudden, customer say, wow, simplify life, simplify back-end infrastructure, build app far quickly much easier manage long-term everything mongodb. really function educating power mongodb really open lot opportunity us. that's doubling down, mix resource really predicated accounts, quota counting resources, whole suite resource bringing table. jason ader -- analyst thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line andrew nowinski well fargo. line open. andrew nowinski -- analyst okay. good afternoon. thank much taking question congrats nice quarter. gave example customer migrated postgres think said issue pg vector function. wondering long customer using postgres decided make change mongo, meaning sort like rebound type customer chose pg -- excuse me, postgres work? frequently seeing type transition? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. can't give specific long using postgres, -- trend seeing business. remember postgres 40-year-old technology. -- beneficiary people lifting shifting type relational databases, oracle, sql server, mysql, et cetera. open-source database. part -- open-source relational database, inherent challenge relational database do. quite inflexible. build schema, hard change schema. hard scale hard distribute data. large data volumes, weird thing like, example, resort off-road storage large data objects, creates performance bottlenecks. again, people default postgres know anything better know relational everyone kind moving relational platforms. that's whole point saying earlier. educate developer flexibility schema, easily horizontally scale rich query language aggregation sophisticated geospatial indexes, productivity gain using document model easy organize data, -- people like, wow, life much easier. want clear, zero-sum game. postgres fail u successful. big market quite excited opportunity, see customer moving postgres coming mongodb. andrew nowinski -- analyst thank you. helpful. maybe quick follow-up. normalize $15 million multiyear deal impact q3, would ea still sequentially q4? thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer given level guidance, trying help understand context full-year number headwind talked beginning year, given strength saw q3. andrew nowinski -- analyst got it. thanks. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line raimo lenschow barclays. line open. raimo lenschow -- analyst hey, thank you. think ea strength quarter, michael, kind give u little bit there. like think renewal -- renewal situation renewal pool coming like q3, coming q4, et cetera, well like mean term upsell, cross-sell opportunity people think starting ai project self-serve, kind mentioned earlier call? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. think -- think ea q4, tends large renewal quarter, talking term guide strength multiyear, that's would expect see ea sequentially, typically pattern, called out. term ai workload things, think early tell obviously, continue evolve assess view get full-year guide march. also updated view cohort behaving sort multiyear played out. think term q4, comment made earlier hopefully help. raimo lenschow -- analyst yeah. okay, perfect. -- talk little bit like obviously, there's debate like database persistent layer ai projects, et cetera. see big hyperscalers term working guy partnerships? obviously aws kind summit, et-cetera. speak little bit like relationship big guy evolving around this? michael, best case talk you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. so, start partnership first, like -- aws, said, re:invent show last week. -- remains very, strong. closed ton deal past quarter. very, large deals. integration new product like q bedrock engagement field really strong. azure, think -- shared past, start-off little bit slow start, word person run partner leadership, azure mongodb relationship never stronger. closed large number deals. part what's called azure native ic service program bunch deep integration azure, including fabric, power bi, visual studio, semantic kernel, azure openai studio. also one azure's largest marketplace partners. gcp -- actually seen uptick term co-sales done past quarter gcp made comp change -- favorable working mongodb saw result field, focused closing -- closing handful large deal gcp q4. general, would say, thing going quite well. term of, guess, implying question like hyperscalers potentially bundling thing along ai offerings? mean, candidly, since day one, hyperscalers bundling database offering every offering that's predominant strategy. -- think executed well strategy database like by-the-way decision. important decision. think hyperscalers seeing performance realize better partner us. said, customer understand importance data layer, especially ai applications. partnership across three hyperscalers strong. raimo lenschow -- analyst ok, perfect. thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer thanks, raimo. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line brad sill bank america. line open. brad sill -- analyst great. thank much, congratulations, michael, next move. wanted ask new workload vector search, stream processing, relational migrator. one three that's ramping faster maybe expected? little bit color new workload type ramping. thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. kind give rundown -- mean, essentially asking new products, like -- search, introduced new capability called atlas search nodes, asymmetrically scale search node search-intensive use case, scale node become quite expensive. seen kind groundbreaking capability really well received. demand quite high customer like tune configuration unique need search requirements. one world's largest bank using atlas search provide like google-like search experience payment data massive corporate customers. customer-facing application performance, scalability critical. leading provider ai-powered accounting software us atlas search power invoice analytics future, allows end user finance team perform ad-hoc analysis easily find past-due invoice voice contain errors. search -- vector search, -- again, kind first full-year since going generally available. product uptake actually very, high. q3, released quantization atlas vector search, reduces memory requirement 96%, allowing u support larger vector workload vastly improved price performance. example, multinational news organization created genai powered tool designed help producer journalist efficiently search, summarize, verify information vast varied data sources. leading security firm using atlas vector search fight ai fraud leading global medium company replaced elastic search hybrid search vector search use case user recommendation engine that's built suggest -- that's built suggest article end users. that's super exciting see well. also seeing lot interest streaming product, demand high. rolled another hyperscaler, customer commenting use case able embed stream processing mongodb make life much easier. overall, quite pleased progress making new products. said before, natively bundling capability really reduces eliminates need customer bolt bunch different technology solve problem, saving lot time, money, cost, risk. brad sill -- analyst that's really exciting. thanks, dev. wanted ask question around cedric's appointment. focus may different leadership thinking going forward? thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer no, cedric cro for, gosh, like think like five, six years, -- interim cro three quarter took last made change really expansion responsibilities. known cedric long time. worked multiple different companies. think good barometer understanding sale leadership. there's number sale leader worked top-tier software company used work me. super-excited role cedric going take also making change cedric better align different organization tightly work together going up-market, app monetization positioning well ideal database genai apps. brad sill -- analyst super exciting. thanks, dev. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer thanks, brad. operator thank you. one moment next question, please. next question coming line mike cikos needham company. line open. mike cikos -- analyst hey guys, thanks taking question here. wanted come back consumption growth slightly better expectation second quarter row now. apology missed it, improvement seeing, across vintage geography potentially concentrated scope? trying get better understanding what's seeking place what's embedded guide. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. no, would describe broad-based, mike. obviously, pleased see continuing monitoring slicing dicing different ways. information insight you, share it. without trying throw whole bunch cold water mind, slightly better, step-function changed better, good see. mike cikos -- analyst terrific. maybe quick follow-up dev. think build maybe tyler's question top q&a, cited customer thinking workload holistically even looking run ai workload on-prem. much think function customer still trying figure optimize latency cost demonstration really early phase exploratory phase versus going production? way coarse two necessarily connected? thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer no, think kind little bit both. think customer committed running big part estate on-prem. definition, going build ai workload, run on-prem, mean also need access gpus that. customer leveraging basically renting gpus cloud provider building ai workloads. think very, early days. still learning, experimenting. more-and-more apps entering production. said prepared remarks, thousand workload -- ai workload running mongodb, small percentage demonstrated meaningful product market fit. initial traction kind still small. think people get sophisticated ai, ai technology matures becomes useful, think application -- start seeing application take-off. kind chuckled today see senior leader bragging chip using versus apps building. tell still very, early day big platform shift. mike cikos -- analyst great point. thank again, guys. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, mike. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line eric heath keybanc. line open. eric heath -- analyst hi, thanks taking question. dev, michael, sound like takeaway call greater focus ea enterprise. structurally rethink ea business differently think healthy double-digit growth business going forward foreseeable future? could ask follow-up question separate that. michael, understand still early identify fiscal '25 cohort workloads, curious high-level look feel like higher quality fiscal '24 cohort workflow. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer want take first one term ea... michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, mean, would say, mean, committed run anywhere strategy. said, first investing community many customer first way experience mongodb. want full experience integrating search vector search core product. gate really start building applications. transition building capability ea. so, clearly investing ea product. atlas still big, big part business big, big part growth engine typically launch new feature atlas capability already have, fact multi-cloud make very, compelling offering many customers. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. think term workloads, think early. reminder folks, tend start small, although grow quickly. think thing add is, pretty consistent pleased new business done. need time let cohort play track them. think like said, happy new business winning. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line william power baird. line open. brian raferty denyeau -- investor relation there, william? william power -- analyst sorry, yeah. thank you. dev, encouraging comment relational migrator. wonder could touch think driving higher interest here. mean, sound like ai contributing helping, great get color still feel like obviously meaningful long-term opportunity. maybe second part question dev michael, great get framework around professional service investments. way kind think quantification timing that? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. reason excited opportunity go legacy application that, one, seems like there's confluence event happening. one increasing cost tax supporting managing legacy apps going enough. second, many customer regulated industries, regulator calling -- fact running legacy apps systemic risk, longer kick road. third, also longer kick around, vendor going end-of-life, make decision migrate application modern tech stack. fourth, genai predicated data build competitive advantage, need leverage proprietary data, people want access data able easily. that's another reason want modernize. also people built application retiring longer firm, creates risk companies. given that, customer incredibly interested figuring way easily safely securely migrate -- applications. always could help easily move data map schema relational schema document schema. hardest part essentially rewriting application. advent genai, significantly reduce time. one, use genai analyze existing code. two, use genai reverse engineer test test code does. three, use genai build new code user test ensure new code produce result old code. time effort suddenly cut meaningful way that's suddenly creating lot interest customer saying, goodness. already relational app, moving another relational app feel like modernization. so, advantage moving mongodb give much modern platform, much agile, flexible, performant, scalable platform future needs. that's excited. again, early days. run number pilot gone well. process working customer migration process. take time very, complex applications. actually, one thing also mentioned going -- saying go tertiary tier 2 tier 3 application, saying, hey, want look crown jewel apps painful us. that's also exciting. again, take time, committed this, think going drive -- help u drive long-term -- meaningful long-term growth. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, will. last part question professional service investment, really building capacity order meet demand seeing relative opportunity. calling particular gross margin impact that's typically show up. maybe last thing probably obvious, sort underscore reason though arr, right, drive new workloads, additional workload mongodb part migration. time, talked before, hope expect able leverage technology more, least initially medium-term, there's going healthy human/services component that. wanted sort effectively telegraph folks. william power -- analyst that's helpful. thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, will. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line rudy kessinger da davidson. please go ahead. rudy kessinger -- analyst hey guys, thanks squeezing here. believe last quarter said consumption growth slightly ahead expectations. slower year-over-year growth versus q2 last year, year-over-year growth improve q1. so, guess curious q3, could make comment regard? obviously, slower year-over-year basis q3 last year, stable year-over-year consumption growth q2 better worse? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. rudy, thanks question. specifically called relative q2. see lower year-over-year growth called out. see seasonal rebound. usually q3 stronger q2 talked smaller prior year. hopefully, help triangulate. rudy kessinger -- analyst okay. quick follow-up. believe q4 call back march. point, dev, said would least another year ai application deployed scale. sound like commentary early large workloads, thousands, many large scale. guess, expectation maybe still least another year seeing broad ai application rollouts scale? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. think lot function what's happening r&d side ai, right? example, today, compelling model designed phones, right, today phone computing horsepower run complex models. so, see ton very, successful consumer apps besides, say, chatgpt claude. -- also see like hundred apps taking like saw kind first generation like internet cloud era, right, mobile era. like think still early day ai. see lot people building ai apps, lot kind fairly rudimentary functionality. think time that's going change. fact, know change. can't predict happen. see apps production, traction, seeing grow very, quickly lot platform. really meaningful. operator thank you. concludes today's q&a session. would like go ahead turn call back dev closing remarks. please go ahead. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thank you, everyone. wanted say really pleased q3 result strong new business performance revenue exceeding expectation -- across atlas ea. making necessary investment expand enterprise channel see largest opportunity establish mongodb standard strongest return go-to-market investments. looking ahead, encouraged progress making accelerating legacy app modernization ai well

Welcome to the MongoDB third-quarter fiscal year 2025 conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there'll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your speaker for today, Brian Denyeau. Please go ahead. Brian Raferty Denyeau -- Investor Relations Thank you, Lisa. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today to review MongoDB's third-quarter fiscal 2025 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued after the close of the market today. Joining me the call today are Dev Ittycheria, president and CEO of MongoDB; and Michael Gordon, MongoDB's COO and CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our market and future growth opportunities, our expectations for the macroeconomic environment in fiscal 2025 and the impact of AI, the benefits of our product platform, our competitive landscape, customer behaviors, our financial guidance, and our planned investments in growth opportunities in AI. These statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including the results of operations and financial condition that cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. For a discussion of the material risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please refer to the risks described in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 31st, 2024 that we filed with the SEC on August 30th, 2024. Any forward-looking statements made on this call reflect our views only as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them except as required by law. Additionally, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures on this conference call. Please refer to the tables in our earnings release in the Investor Relations portion of our website for a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dev. Dev? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we had a strong quarter of new business and executed well against our large market opportunity. Let's begin by reviewing our third quarter results before giving you a broader company update. We generated revenue of $529 million, a 22% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew 26% year-over-year, representing 68% of total revenue. We generated non-GAAP operating income of $101 million for a 19% non-GAAP operating margin and we ended the quarter with over 52,600 customers. Overall, we were pleased with our performance in the third quarter. We had a strong new business quarter and we're happy with our new workload acquisition on Atlas. Our non-Atlas business significantly exceeded expectations in part because we benefited from a few large multi-year deals as customers continue to value our run anywhere strategy and want to build a deeper longer-term relationship with MongoDB. Atlas consumption was slightly better than expected in a macro-environment that we would characterize as largely consistent with what we saw in the first half of the year. Michael will cover consumption trends in more detail. Retention rates remained strong in Q3, demonstrating the mission criticality of our platform. On our Q1 earnings call, we shared with you the three major strategic initiatives that we believe will enable us to maximize our long-term opportunity. I want to give you an update on the progress we're making on those initiatives. First, we are increasing our investment in the enterprise channel since we see the strongest returns in this part of the market. Specifically, we're expanding our strategic account program going to next year, as we see more accounts that will benefit from incremental investment. In addition, we're investing time and resources to educate developers in large enterprise accounts and uplevel their MongoDB skills. These organizations have thousands of developers and as we penetrate them more deeply, we encounter developers who have historically only built SQL applications and simply do not know how to use MongoDB to its full potential. In our experience, educating these developers on the benefits of MongoDB drives significant incremental adoption of our platform. To fund these up-market investments, we are reallocating a portion of our mid-market investments. The mid-market remains an attractive opportunity for us, but we believe that prioritizing investment up-market will deliver strong returns in the current environment. We also believe there are additional ways to serve the mid-market more efficiently through our self-serve channel and other scaled technology-enabled sales and customer service motions. Second, we are optimistic about the opportunity to accelerate legacy app modernization using AI and are investing more in this area. As you recall, we ran a few successful pilots earlier this year, demonstrating that AI tooling combined with professional services and our relational migrator product can significantly reduce the time, cost, and risk of migrating legacy applications onto MongoDB. While it's early days, we have observed a more than 50% reduction in the cost to modernize. On the back of these strong early results, additional customer interest is exceeding our expectations. Large enterprises in every industry and geography are experiencing acute pain from their legacy infrastructure and are eager for more agile, performant, and cost-effective solutions. Not only are customers excited to engage with us, they also want to focus on some of the most important applications in their enterprise, further demonstrating the level of interest and size of the long-term opportunity. As relational applications encompass a wide variety of database types, programming languages, versions, and other customer-specific variables, we expect modernization projects to continue to include meaningful service engagements in the short and medium term. Consequently, we're increasing our professional services delivery capabilities, both directly and through partners. In the long run, we expect to automate and simplify large parts of the modernization process. To that end, we are leveraging the learnings from early service engagement to develop new tools to accelerate future modernization efforts. Although it's early days and scaling our legacy app modernization capabilities will take time, we have increased conviction that this motion will significantly add to our growth in the long term. Third, we are investing to capitalize on our inherent technical advantages as a key component of the emerging AI tech stack. As a reminder, MongoDB is uniquely equipped to query rich and complex data structures typical of AI applications. The ability of a database to query rich and complex data structures is crucial because AI applications often rely on highly detailed, interrelated, and nuanced data to make accurate predictions and decisions. For example, a recommendation system doesn't just analyze a single customer's purchase but also considers their browsing history, peer group behavior, and product categories requiring a database that can query and interlink these complex data structures. In addition, MongoDB's architecture unifies source data, metadata, operational data, and vector data in an all-in-one platform, updating the need for multiple database systems and complex back-end architectures. This enables a more compelling developer experience than any other alternative. From what we see in the AI market today, most customers are still in the experimental stage as they work to understand the effectiveness of the underlying tech stack and build early proof-of-concept applications. However, we are seeing an increasing number of AI apps in production. Today, we have thousands of AI apps on our platform. What we don't yet see is many of these apps actually achieving meaningful product market fit and therefore significant traction. In fact, as you take a step back and look at the entire universe of AI apps, a very small percentage of them have achieved the type of scale that we commonly see with enterprise-specific applications. We do have some AI apps that are growing quickly, including one that is already a seven-figure workload that has grown 10 times since the beginning of the year. Similar to prior platform shifts as the usefulness of AI tech improves and becomes more cost-effective, we will see the emergence of many more AI apps that do nail product market fit, but it's difficult to predict when that will happen more broadly. We remain confident that we will capture our fair share of these successful AI applications as we see that our platform is popular with developers building more sophisticated AI use cases. We continue investing in our product capabilities, including enterprise-grade Atlas Vector Search functionality to build on this momentum and even better position MongoDB to capture the AI opportunity. In addition, as previously announced, we are bringing search and vector service to our community and EA offerings, leveraging our run anywhere competitive advantage in the world of AI. Finally, we are expanding our MongoDB AI applications program or MAAP, which helps enterprise customers build and bring AI applications into production by providing them with reference architectures, integrations with leading tech providers, and coordinated services and support. Last week, we announced a new code of partners including McKinsey, Confluent, Capgemini, and Unstructured, as well as the collaboration with Meta to enable developers to build AI-enriched applications on MongoDB using Llama. Next, I'd like to provide you with a brief product update. At our dot local developer conference in London in October, we announced the general availability of MongoDB 8.0, the fastest and most performant version of MongoDB ever. MongoDB 8.0 performs 20% to 60% better against common industry benchmarks compared to our prior version and is built to exceed our customers' most stringent security, resiliency, availability, and performance requirements. To best serve our customers, we regularly review and reprioritize investments in our product portfolio to ensure we're allocating our resources to products with the highest demand from our customers. And to do that, we also deprecate products that are not showing results we desired. Consequently, we made the decision to consolidate our Atlas serverless offerings with our smallest dedicated tiers to create Atlas Flex customers, a new offering with a simpler architecture that provides the elasticity features akin to serverless. We will begin migrating effective customers to the single, simple, entry-level solution in Q4. We also decided to deprecate Atlas DeviceSync and other capabilities not widely adopted in order to focus our engineering resources on the core platform. While these reprioritization decisions are not made lightly, they allow us to deliver the most value to the largest number of customers, reinforcing our commitment to being the best modern database and helping us to grow faster. Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the adoption trends of MongoDB across our customer base. Customers across industries and around the world are running mission-critical projects in MongoDB Atlas, leveraging the full power of our developer data platform, including Financial Times, CarGurus, and Victoria's Secret. As part of the digital transformation journey, global specialty retailer Victoria's Secret & Company migrated its e-commerce platform to MongoDB Atlas. As a fully managed platform, MongoDB Atlas allowed the company to simplify its architecture and improve performance, supporting the retailer to provide a resilient, secure, and fast web and mobile e-commerce experience for their millions of customers around the world. Allianz, Alphamad, Swiss Post, and Paylocity are turning to MongoDB to modernize applications. Paylocity, a leading provider of cloud-based payroll and human capital management software, selected MongoDB to power proprietary application aimed at fostering employee connections and engagement. When traffic increased and the original SQL-based solution was unable to keep up with the required performance metrics, Paylocity migrated to MongoDB Atlas to take advantage of the flexible schema architecture, performance, and scalability. MongoDB costs five times less than the previous SQL database solution and the company's developers can now create an application within minutes, something that used to take weeks. Mature companies and start-ups alike are using MongoDB to help deliver the next wave of AI-powered application to customers, including NerdWallet, Cisco, and Tealbook. Tealbook, a supplier intelligence platform, migrated from Postgres, pgvector, and ElasticSearch to MongoDB to eliminate technical debt and consolidate their tech stack. The company experienced workload isolation and scalability issues in pgvector and were concerned with the search index inconsistencies, which were all resolved with the migration to MongoDB. With Atlas Vector search and dedicated search nodes, Tealbook has realized improved cost-efficiency and increased scalability for the supplier data platform, an application that uses GenAI to collect, verify, and enrich supplier data across various sources. In summary, we had a healthy Q3 with both Atlas and EA exceeding expectations. We saw a strong new business quarter and we remain confident in our ability to become an increasing strategic provider in our large and growing market. Looking forward, we see a great opportunity to grow our adoption in the enterprise through new workloads, modernizing legacy applications, and winning the next generation of AI-powered applications. I would like to finish by providing an update on our senior leadership. First, as we announced early in the press release, after nearly 10 years, Michael Gordon has made the decision to leave MongoDB. Michael has been instrumental in MongoDB's success over the past decade, leading our successful IPO, helping us grow our revenue nearly 50-fold, and scaling -- and successfully scaling our business model to generate meaningful operating leverage. He has been a trusted advisor and business partner to the Board and me over the years and also has become a personal friend. Michael is excited to take a well-deserved break. We have commenced the search for Michael's replacement and will be evaluating both internal and external candidates. One of Michael's proudest compliments -- accomplishments has been building a world-class finance team under his leadership, and I'm confident that we will not miss a beat during this transition. Michael will continue to serve as CFO through January 31st to help us finish the fiscal year and then will transition to an Advisor to the company to ensure a seamless process. If we have not named Michael's successor by fiscal year-end, Serge Tanjga, SVP of Finance, will serve as Interim CFO, beginning on February 1st. Second, we are promoting Cedric Pech, currently our chief revenue officer to the newly created role of president worldwide field operations. In this new position, Cedric will oversee all our field-based customer-facing and go-to-market enablement teams, including professional services. We believe this org structure will best enable us to execute on some of the key strategic initiatives I discussed earlier, in particular, our increased focus on up-market and the app monetization opportunity. I would like to congratulate Cedric on this well-deserved promotion. With that, let me turn the call over to Michael. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Dev, and thanks for the kind words and our incredible partnership over the past decade. The past 10 years have been the most rewarding in my professional career and I'm extremely proud of what we've achieved together and of course, to the whole MongoDB team. With as much success as we had, I still believe that MongoDB is in the early stages of realizing its full potential as it continues to take share in one of the largest markets in software. Now, turning to the results for the quarter. I'll begin with a detailed review of our third-quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025. First, I'll start with our third quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $529.4 million, up 22% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance. Shifting to our product mix, Atlas grew 26% in the quarter compared to the previous year and now represents 68% of total revenue compared to 66% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and 71% last quarter. We recognized Atlas revenue primarily based on customer consumption of our platform and that consumption is closely tied to end user activity of their applications. Let me provide some context on Atlas consumption in the quarter. In Q3, consumption was slightly ahead of our expectations. This year's Q3 seasonal improvement was more muted than in years past as expected. On a year-over-year basis, consumption growth remains below that of prior year period. Turning to non-Atlas revenue. Non-Atlas came in significantly ahead of our expectations. As Dev mentioned, EA new business was strong, and we continue to have success selling incremental workloads into our existing customer base. In addition, our Q3 non-Atlas revenue benefited from a few large multi-year deals. As you know, due to ASC 606, we recognized the entire term license component of a multi-year contract at the start of that contract. Compared to Q3 of last year, the multi-year license component of non-Atlas revenues was over $15 million higher. Turning to customer growth. During the third quarter, we grew our customer base by approximately 1,900 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 52,600, which is up from over 46,400 in the year-ago period. Of our total customer count, over 7,400 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 6,900 in the year-ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven primarily by Atlas, which had over 51,100 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 44,900 in the year-ago period. It is important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers adding their first Atlas workload. Continuing on, in Q3, our net ARR expansion rate was approximately 120%. We ended the quarter with 2,314 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, up from $1,972 in the year-ago period. Moving down the income statement, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the third quarter was $405.7 million, representing a gross margin of 77%, which is flat versus the year-ago period. Our income from operations was $101.5 million or 19% operating margin for the third quarter compared to an 18% operating margin in the year-ago period. The primary reason for more favorable operating income results versus guidance is our revenue outperformance, including the very high margin multi-year license revenue benefit. Net income in the third quarter was $98.1 million or $1.16 per share, based on 84.2 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a net income of $79.1 million or $0.96 per share on 83.7 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding in the year-ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the third quarter with $2.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $37.4 million. After taking into consideration approximately $2.9 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was $34.6 million in the quarter. This compares to free cash flow of $35 million in the year-ago period. In Q3, we did not incur capital expenditures to purchase IPV4 addresses as we previously expected, but we did start making those purchases in November and still expect a total outlay of $20 million to $25 million this fiscal year as we previously communicated. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $515 million to $519 million. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $55 million to $58 million and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.65 based on 84.9 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. For the full-fiscal year 2025, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.973 billion to $1.977 billion, non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $242 million to $245 million, and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $3.01 to $3.03 based on 84 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. Note that the non-GAAP net income per share guidance for the fourth-quarter and full-fiscal year 2025 includes a non-GAAP tax provision of approximately 20%. I'll now provide some more context around our updated guidance. First, in terms of Atlas consumption, we expect to see a typical seasonal slowdown in Q4, driven by underlying application usage moderating during the holiday season. Second, since Atlas consumption remained lower on a year-over-year basis in Q3, we expect to see continued deceleration of Atlas year-over-year growth in Q4. Third, we expect to see a sequential decline in non-Atlas revenue in Q4, which is contrary to our normal pattern. The reason for this is that we experienced a significant additional benefit from multi-year deals in Q3, which we do not expect to recur in Q4. In addition, I want to provide some incremental color on some of our recent product and -- how some of our recent product and go-to-market changes will impact the growth of our reported customer count going forward. First, as Dev explained, we are reallocating a portion of our go-to-market resources from the mid-market to the enterprise channel. As a result, we expect to see significantly fewer mid-market direct sales customer net additions and as a result, slower direct sales customer growth going forward. We believe this reallocation of investment dollars will drive higher revenue growth over time. So, it's a trade-off that makes sense. Second, as we introduce Atlas Flex clusters in Q4 and automatically migrate customers in Q1, we expect to see a one-time negative impact to our customer count since we have approximately 4,000 serverless customers who are very low spending and we do not expect them to transition over to Flex. These customers have a negligible impact on our revenue but will impact our reported customer count. To summarize, we're pleased with our third quarter results and especially our ability to win new business. We have a small share in one of the largest and fastest-growing markets in all of software with a number of secular tailwinds, including AI at our back. We'll continue investing judiciously and focusing on our execution to capture this long-term opportunity. With that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator? Questions & Answers: Operator [Operator instructions] Our first question for the day will be coming from Sanjit Singh of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Thank you for taking the questions and congrats, Michael, on outstanding career. You had an absolutely fantastic run at MongoDB. I'm excited to see what you do next, or excited if you just take a breather. So congrats, Michael. I guess to take the question -- to start off with the questions, when we look at what Atlas has been doing in the past two quarters, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think consumption is coming in at least modestly ahead of your expectations. Relative to what we've seen at the beginning of the year, what sort of -- is it a function of sales execution? Is it a function of the end-user activity sort of improving? What's driving at least the improvement in Atlas consumption in the past two quarters? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So a few different things. So I think if you look at our outlook at the beginning of the year, we had indicated that we thought we would see stable Atlas growth from a consumption standpoint. What we've seen and what we've talked about is -- we've actually seen lower year-over-year growth based on the underlying consumption. And so -- and that's incorporated into our Q4 guide. We have seen the Q3 and Q4 be -- sorry, Q2 and Q3, excuse me, be better than our expectations, but it's still down on a year-over-year basis. And so I want to make sure that we're not sort of confusing the comparative set of year-over-year versus relative to our expectations. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Understood. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer And the core of it, Sanjit, to your question is really the underlying usage of the applications. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Yeah, that makes total sense. And then, Dev, I have to ask you the AI agent question. In terms of an AI agent needing more context, it has going to have a set of tools to take its actions. What does it mean for MongoDB as an operational data store as customers start to roll out more agentic applications? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, just to talk about agents, I think when you think about agents, there's jobs, there's -- sorry, there's a job, there's projects and then there's task. Right now, the agents that are being rolled out are really focused on task like say something from Sierra or some other companies are rolling out agents. But you're right, what they deemed to do is to deal with being able to create a rich and complex data structures. Now why is this important for AI is that AI models don't just look at isolated data points, but they need to understand relationships, hierarchies, and patterns within the data. They need to be able to essentially get real-time insights. For example, if you have a chatbot where someone is querying, a customer is kind of trying to get some update on the order they placed five minutes ago because they may have not gotten any confirmation, your chatbot needs to be able to deal with real-time information. You need to be able to deal with basically handling very advanced use cases, understanding like, to do things like fraud detection to understand behaviors of supply chains, you need to understand intricate data relationships. All these things are consistent with MongoDB offers. And so we believe that at the end of the day, we are well-positioned to handle this. And the other thing that I would say is that we've embedded in a very natural way of search and vector search. So we're just not an OLTP database, we do tech search and vector search. That's all one experience and no other platform offers that, and we think we have a real advantage. And so we're integrated with the leading AI frameworks and platforms. We have enterprise-grade security and compliance, and customers can run us anywhere, either on 118 cloud regions or on-prem, and that again is a huge differentiator for us. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Awesome. Appreciate the thoughts, Dev. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Sanjit. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Taylor -- Tyler Radke of Citi. Your line is open. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Hi, thank you very much for taking the question. And, Michael, all the best, and congratulations on 10 years. Going back to the sales execution, I mean, one of the things that you talked about earlier this year was some challenges just in terms of the recently acquired workloads ramping. And I think a lot of those were from the past fiscal year. So curious how the quality of workload acquisition has trended this year. And as you think about the ramp in consumption potential into next year, how does that sort of look versus this time a year ago? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Maybe I'll just talk about what we're doing and the changes we made and then Michael can talk a little bit about the consumption trends. So, we did make some changes at the beginning of the year, and we really wanted to focus on both the volume and the quality of the workloads and there were some slight adjustments that we made. We think those changes are having a reasonable positive impact. Again, it's too early to declare victory because these workloads usually start small and grow over time, but we're really pleased with the results we're seeing so far. And -- but again, it's early days. And obviously, we'll know about the fiscal '25 workloads as we go into fiscal '26. But so far, so good. Michael, on consumption? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, just a couple of things, and thanks, Tyler. The fiscal '24 cohorts that we called out earlier, that slower growth does continue. They've been in line with our revised expectations. We made some changes that we talked about at the -- earlier in the year that should affect the fiscal '25 cohorts, but it's just too early to tell. On those, we need a few more quarters of data before you can really see if we're -- how we're seeing those behave differently. I will say we've talked about the new business environment and our success in new business. We have been pleased with that, but that just shows kind of the initial piece, and we need to see how they grow and how those cohorts evolve. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Great. Thanks. And follow-up on the EA side, you talked about the outsized strength in non-Atlas business this quarter. Maybe if you could unpack like the relative upside that was driven by simply duration versus new business. I know you called out the duration impact year-over-year, but are -- do you feel like this was sort of a one-off or do you feel like maybe some of your bigger customers are indexing more toward EA and how does that impact the way you think about the product and introducing things like vector search and stream processing onto the on-prem product? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, thank you. So overall, we continue to find the EA product resonate with customers. It's an important part of the run anywhere strategy and we've continued to see success with that and people wanting to increase their investment in MongoDB. There's always been a multiyear component and we continue to see that. We talked about that at the beginning of the year as to how fiscal '24 had an abnormally high amount of multi-year benefit and therefore, we were anticipating that being a headwind and we quantified that in roughly the $40 million range. What we talked about on this call earlier is we saw from a few large accounts, a surprising amount of multiyear that positively benefited Q3 at a little more than $15 million in revenue compared to what we saw Q3 a year ago. So, not as much of a headwind as we had been expecting. Obviously, with the 606 dynamics, some of these things, especially for a large deal can be kind of meaty and chunky and lumpy, which is why we try and call it out and sort of help people understand, but there's a pretty healthy kind of baseline flow, not just of EA, but also of multiyear. And when we see spikes, we just try and call it out for you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I just want to add, Tyler, that we are investing in our what we call our EA business. First, we're starting by investing with search and vector search and a community product. That does a couple of things for us. One, whenever anyone starts with MongoDB with the open-source product, they immediately get all the benefits of that complete highly integrated platform. Two, those capabilities will then migrate to EA. So, EA for us is an investment strategy. We definitely see lots of large customers who are very, very committed to running workloads on-prem. We even see some customers want to run to run AI workloads on-prem. So, the optionality they get by using MongoDB to not just be on-prem and the cloud, but also cross-cloud is a very compelling one. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Brad Reback of Stifel. Your line is open. Brad Reback -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. And, Michael, best of luck. It's been a great run. Dev, you started the call talking about a bunch of investments, which are great given the growth of the business. And obviously, you talked about reallocating some expenses. But net-net, should we think about this incremental investment phase next year as gating margin upside? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think that's something that we obviously are not ready to talk about next year just now, but I would say that we -- the reason we're looking to invest and just to summarize again, going up-market on legacy app modernization where we see very large workloads potentially at play and being the ideal database for GenAI apps, which is the future as important investments to drive long-term growth. And we're quite energized by those investments and that's something that we have high conviction on. Brad Reback -- Analyst That's great. And then on the MAAP program, are most of those workloads going to wind up in Atlas or will that be a healthy combination of EA and Atlas? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think it's again early days. I would say -- I would probably say more on the side of Atlas and EA in the early days. I think once we introduce a search and vector search into the EA product, you'll see more of that on-prem. Obviously, people can use MongoDB for AI workloads using other technologies as well in conjunction with MongoDB for on-prem AI use cases. But I would say you're probably going to see that happen first in Atlas. Brad Reback -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Jason Ader of William Blair. Your line is open. Jason Ader -- Analyst Yeah, thank you. I'm not going to belabor congratulating Michael, but it has been it has been fun working with you and best of luck. The question I had is on the strength in EA. Do you think, Dev, it represents a comment on how enterprises might be rethinking or reassessing the kind of on-prem versus cloud workload placement decision? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Well, when I think about large enterprises, I think large enterprises have meaningful workloads that are still running on-prem. I think the belief that everything would go to the cloud was probably something that was really popular in the good old days of Zurp. But I think now as customers assess their investments that they already have in place, they're being much more judicious about where they run those workloads and if they think they can leverage their existing investments in their own infrastructure, then they're going to do so. Also for a bunch of other reasons like regulatory reasons, some customers are quite not moving as aggressively to the cloud. We see that in particularly in Europe, where we see a lot of the European banks still running majority of the workloads on-prem. So it also varies by region where conversely in Asia, we're seeing people much move much more aggressively to the cloud. So I think it really depends on industry, on geography, and on the personal dynamics of what's happening in that particular account. I mean, we see some large US banks are also very committed to running things on-prem. So it really varies. And that's why we feel really good about our run anywhere strategy because it gives customer optionality. They can build something and run on-prem. And if and when they choose to move to the cloud, it's very easy to do so with MongoDB. Jason Ader -- Analyst All right. And then just as a follow-up also on the investments you're making in strategic sales and enterprise. Could you just get a little more specific on what those investments might be? Is it hiring a lot of new salespeople? Is it working more with SIs, investing more in SIs? Any additional detail would be helpful. Thanks. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So just for everyone's benefit, we've identified a number of accounts, which we call strategic accounts, which we think that have high upside for us. We've seen a number of accounts that grow very quickly when we deploy the right mix of resources. Now they're all not necessarily quota-carrying resources. They could be additional technical sales resources, additional PS resources, additional customer service resources to better service and support those accounts. We even do things like run education sessions for developers of the accounts, they're called either hackathons or like what we call developer days or even design reviews where we'll meet with our development teams who are looking to build an application, help them think about how they would potentially use MongoDB to build that particular app. And what we find is that because many of these developers, the experience with MongoDB is quite limited, the more we can engage with them, the more we can educate them and the more we can show them how simple and easy it is. Like for example, most customers today think like they have to use an OLTP database, then a search database, maybe a vector database, and then like a caching database. And all that is integrated in MongoDB. So all of a sudden, customers can say, wow, I can simplify my life, simplify my back-end infrastructure, build this app far more quickly and it will be much more easier to manage long-term if I do everything on MongoDB. And it's really a function of just educating them on the power of MongoDB that really opens up a lot of opportunities for us. So that's why we're doubling down, and the mix of resources is really predicated on the accounts, but it's not just quota counting resources, it's the whole suite of resources that we're bringing to the table. Jason Ader -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Andrew Nowinski of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Okay. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking the question and congrats on a nice quarter. You gave an example of a customer that migrated off Postgres and I think you said they had issues with their PG vector function. I was wondering how long was that customer using Postgres before they decided to make a change to Mongo, meaning was this some sort of like a rebound type customer where they chose PG -- or excuse me, Postgres and it didn't work? And then how frequently are you seeing this type of transition? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So I can't give you the specifics on how long they were using Postgres, but this is not -- this is a trend that we're seeing in our business. You have to remember Postgres is a 40-year-old technology. It's -- and they have been the beneficiary of people lifting and shifting from other types of relational databases, Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, et cetera. And they're an open-source database. And but as part -- because they're an open-source and relational database, they have the same inherent challenges all relational databases do. They're quite inflexible. So once you build a schema, it's very hard to change the schema. It's hard to scale and hard to distribute data. And if you have large data volumes, you have to do weird things like, for example, resort to off-road storage for large data objects, which creates performance bottlenecks. And so again, people default to Postgres if they don't know anything better because all they know is relational and everyone is kind of moving off those other relational platforms. And that's the whole point I was saying earlier. Once we educate developers on the flexibility of schema, how easily or horizontally scale the rich query language where you can do aggregations and do sophisticated geospatial indexes, the productivity gains by using the document model and how easy is to organize data, it's -- people are just like, wow, life is so much easier. Now I want to be clear, this is not a zero-sum game. Postgres does not have to fail for us to be successful. It's a big market and we're quite excited about the opportunity, but we do see customers moving off Postgres and coming to MongoDB. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Thank you. That was very helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up. If we normalize the $15 million multiyear deal impact you had in Q3, would EA still be down sequentially in Q4? Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer We haven't given that level of guidance, but just trying to help you understand in the context of the full-year numbers and the headwind that we talked about at the beginning of the year, just given the strength that we saw in Q3. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Got it. Thanks. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. The next question will be coming from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst Hey, thank you. And if you think about the EA strength this quarter, Michael, you'd kind of give us a little bit there. Like how should we think about renewal -- the renewal situation renewal pool coming up like or that you had in Q3, coming up in Q4, et cetera, as well and then like what does it mean in terms of upsell, cross-sell opportunity as people think about starting AI projects by self-serve, as you kind of mentioned earlier on the call? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So I think about -- if you think about EA for Q4, it tends to be a large renewal quarter, but what we're talking about in terms of the guide is because we had such strength in multiyear, that's where we would expect to see our EA down sequentially, which is not typically our pattern, which is why we called it out. In terms of AI workloads and some of those other things, I think it's early to tell and obviously, we'll continue to evolve and assess our view when we get to the full-year guide in March. And then we'll also have an updated view on how the cohorts are behaving and sort of how multiyear played out. But I think in terms of Q4, the comments that I made earlier hopefully will help. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst Yeah. Okay, perfect. And then the -- and can you talk a little bit about like obviously, there's a debate of like which database will be the persistent layer if you do AI projects, et cetera. What do you see from the big hyperscalers in terms of working with you guys and partnerships? We obviously just have AWS kind of summit, et-cetera. Can you speak a little bit like how your relationship with those big guys is evolving around this? And Michael, All the best in case I don't talk to you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, I'll start with the partnerships first, like our -- with AWS, as you said, they just had their re:Invent show last week. Our -- it remains very, very strong. We've closed a ton of deals this past quarter. Some of them very, very large deals. We're doing integrations to some of the new products like Q and Bedrock and the engagement in the field has been really strong. On Azure, I think we -- as I've shared in the past, we start-off with a little bit of a slow start, but in the words of the person who runs their partner leadership, the Azure MongoDB relationship has never been stronger. We've closed a large number of deals. We're part of what's called the Azure native IC service program and have a bunch of deep integrations with Azure, including Fabric, Power BI, Visual Studio, Semantic Kernel, and Azure OpenAI Studio. And we're also one of Azure's largest marketplace partners. And GCP does -- we have actually seen some uptick in terms of co-sales that we've done this past quarter and GCP made some comp changes where they -- that were favorable to working with MongoDB that we saw some results in the field, and we're focused on closing on -- closing a handful of large deals with GCP in Q4. So in general, I would say, things are going quite well. And then in terms of, I guess, implying your question was like the hyperscalers and are they potentially bundling things along with their AI offerings? I mean, candidly, since day one, the hyperscalers have been bundling their database offerings with every offering that they have and that's been their predominant strategy. And we've -- I think we've executed well against strategy because databases are not like a by-the-way decision. It's an important decision. And I think the hyperscalers are seeing our performance and realize it's better to partner with us. And as I said, customers understand the importance of the data layer, especially for AI applications. And so the partnership across all three hyperscalers is strong. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst OK, perfect. Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Raimo. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. The next question will be coming from the line of Brad Sills of Bank of America. Your line is open. Brad Sills -- Analyst Great. Thank you so much, and congratulations, Michael, on your next move. I wanted to ask about new workloads here on vector search, stream processing, relational migrator. Is there any one of those three that's ramping faster than maybe you expected? Just a little bit of color on how those new workload types are ramping. Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I'll kind of give you just a rundown of some of the -- I mean, essentially you're asking about the new products, like our -- on search, we introduced a new capability called Atlas search nodes, which where you can asymmetrically scale your search nodes because if you have a search-intensive use case, you don't have to scale all your nodes because they have become quite expensive. And we've seen that this kind of groundbreaking capability really well received. The demand is quite high and because customers like they can tune the configuration to the unique needs of their search requirements. One of the world's largest banks is using Atlas Search to provide like a Google-like search experience on payments data for massive corporate customers. So this is a customer-facing application and so performance, and scalability are critical. A leading provider of AI-powered accounting software uses Atlas Search to power its invoice analytics future, which allows end users and finance teams to perform ad-hoc analysis and easily find past-due invoices and voices that contain errors. So that search -- on vector search, it -- again, and it's been our kind of our first full-year since going generally available. And the product uptake has been actually very, very high. In Q3, we released quantization for Atlas Vector Search, which reduces the memory requirements by up to 96%, allowing us to support larger vector workloads with vastly improved price performance. For example, a multinational news organization created a GenAI powered tool designed to help producers and journalists efficiently search, summarize, and verify information from vast and varied data sources. A leading security firm is using Atlas Vector Search to fight AI fraud and a leading global media company replaced elastic search with hybrid search and vector search use case for a user recommendation engine that's built to suggest -- that's built in to suggest articles to end users. And so that's super exciting to see as well. We're also seeing a lot of interest in our streaming product, demand is very high. We just rolled it out to another hyperscaler, and customers are commenting on that the use cases of being able to embed stream processing with MongoDB makes our life so much easier. So overall, we're quite pleased with the progress we're making on the new products. And as I said before, natively bundling all these capabilities really reduces or eliminates the need for customers to have to bolt on a bunch of different technologies to solve the same problem, saving them a lot of time, money, cost, and risk. Brad Sills -- Analyst That's really exciting. Thanks, Dev. And then I wanted to ask a question around Cedric's appointment. Any focus that may be different here under his leadership that we should be thinking about going forward? Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer No, Cedric has been our CRO for, gosh, now like I think like five, six years, and he -- I was the Interim CRO for about three quarters until he took over when we last made a change and this is really an expansion of his responsibilities. I've known Cedric for a long time. He and I have worked with at multiple different companies. I think I have a good barometer for understanding sales leadership. There's a number of sales leaders who worked at other top-tier software companies who used to work for me or with me. And so I'm super-excited by the role Cedric is going to take and then we're also making some changes under Cedric to better align the different organizations so that we can more tightly work together on going up-market, on app monetization and positioning ourselves well to be the ideal database for GenAI apps. Brad Sills -- Analyst Super exciting. Thanks, Dev. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Brad. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question, please. Our next question will be coming from the line of Mike Cikos of Needham and Company. Your line is open. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Hey guys, thanks for taking the question here. I just wanted to come back to the consumption growth being slightly better than expectations again for the second quarter in a row now. And apologies if I missed it, but this improvement that we're seeing, is this across all vintages and geographies or is it potentially more concentrated in scope? Just trying to get a better understanding of what's seeking place out there and what's embedded in the guide. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. No, I would describe it as broad-based, Mike. And obviously, we're pleased to see it and we're continuing monitoring and slicing and dicing it in different ways. And as we have information or insights to you, we'll share it. And without trying to throw a whole bunch of cold water on our mind, it was slightly better, or a step-function changed better, but good to see. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Terrific. And maybe for a quick follow-up for Dev. I think it builds off maybe Tyler's question at the top of the Q&A, but you had cited that some customers are thinking about their workloads more holistically and even looking to run AI workloads on-prem. How much of that do you think is just a function of customers are still trying to figure out how to optimize for latency and cost or is this more a demonstration of we really are in the early phases of the exploratory phase versus going into production? Is there any way to coarse that out or is the two not necessarily connected? Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer No, I think it's kind of a little bit of both. I think you have some customers who are very committed to running a big part of the estate on-prem. So by definition, then if they're going to build an AI workload, it has to be run on-prem, which means that they also need access to GPUs and they're doing that. And then other customers are leveraging basically renting GPUs from the cloud providers and building their own AI workloads. I do think we're in the very, very early days. They're still learning, experimenting. More-and-more apps are entering production. And as I said on the prepared remarks, we have thousands of workload -- AI workloads running on MongoDB, but a very small percentage of them have demonstrated meaningful product market fit. And so the initial traction is kind of still small. But I think as people get more sophisticated with AI, as the AI technology matures and becomes more and more useful, I think applications will -- you'll start seeing these applications take-off. I kind of chuckled that today I see more senior leaders bragging about the chips they're using versus the apps they're building. So it just tells you that we're still in the very, very early days of this big platform shift. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Great point. Thank you again, guys. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Mike. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Eric Heath of KeyBanc. Your line is open. Eric Heath -- Analyst Hi, thanks for taking the question. Dev, Michael, it sounds like the takeaway from the call is a greater focus on EA and on enterprise. So should we structurally rethink the EA business differently and think of this more as a healthy double-digit growth business going forward for the foreseeable future? And then if I could just ask a follow-up question separate to that. But Michael, I understand that it's still early to identify the fiscal '25 cohort of workloads, but just curious at a high-level if they look and feel like of higher quality than the fiscal '24 cohort of workflow. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Do you want to take on the first one in terms of EA... Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, I mean, I would say, I mean, we are very committed to our run anywhere strategy. And as I said, we are first investing in community where for many customers is the first way they experience MongoDB. And we want them to have the full experience of integrating search and Vector search into our core product. And so they can out of the gate really start building applications. That will then transition to building those capabilities into EA. So, we are clearly investing in the EA product. But Atlas is still a big, big part of our business and a big, big part of our growth engine and we typically launch new features on Atlas and because of the capabilities we already have, the fact it's multi-cloud makes it a very, very compelling offering for many customers. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. And I think in terms of the workloads, I do think it's early. Just as a reminder for folks, they tend to start small, although grow quickly. I think the only other thing that I can add is, we've been pretty consistent and that we've been pleased with the new business that we've done. But we need some time to let the cohorts play out as we track them. But I think like I said, we've been happy with the new business that we were winning. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of William Power of Baird. Your line is open. Brian Raferty Denyeau -- Investor Relations You there, William? William Power -- Analyst Sorry, yeah. Thank you. Dev, you had some encouraging comments on relational migrator. I wonder if you could just touch on what you think is driving the higher interest here. I mean, it sounds like AI is contributing and helping, but it'd be great to get some more color there because that still feels like obviously a meaningful long-term opportunity. And then maybe the second part of the question for Dev or Michael, just be great to get any other framework around the professional services investments. Any way to kind of think about quantification and timing of that? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So the reason we're so excited about the opportunity to go after legacy applications is that, one, it seems like there's a confluence of events happening. One is that the increasing cost and tax of supporting and managing these legacy apps are just going up enough. Second, for many customers who are in regulated industries, the regulators are calling their -- the fact that they're running on these legacy apps with systemic risk, so they can no longer kick the can down the road. Third, also because they no longer can kick the can around, some vendors are going end-of-life, so they have to make a decision to migrate those applications to a more modern tech stack. Fourth, because GenAI is so predicated on data and to build a competitive advantage, you need to leverage your proprietary data, people want to access that data and be able to do so easily. And so that's another reason for them to want to modernize. And then you also have people who built those applications who are retiring or just no longer in the firm, so it just creates more and more risk for the companies. Given all that, customers are incredibly interested in figuring out a way to easily and safely and securely migrate those -- off those applications. And we always could help them very easily move the data and map the schema from a relational schema to a document schema. The hardest part was essentially rewriting the application. Now with the advent of GenAI, you can now significantly reduce the time. One, you can use GenAI to analyze existing code. Two, you can use GenAI to reverse engineer tests to test what the code does. And then three, you can use GenAI to build new code and then users test it to ensure that the new code produces the same results as the old code. And so all that time and effort is suddenly cut in a meaningful way and that's suddenly creating a lot of interest from customers saying, my goodness. And if you're already on a relational app, moving to another relational app doesn't feel like modernization. So, the other advantage is that moving to MongoDB gives them a much more modern platform, a much more agile, flexible, performant, and scalable platform for their future needs. And that's why we're so excited. Again, it's early days. We've run a number of pilots that have gone well. We're in the process of working with some customers now in the migration process. This will take time because these are very, very complex applications. And actually, one thing I also mentioned was that they're not just going after -- saying go after some tertiary Tier 2 or Tier 3 application, they're saying, hey, we want you to look at some of our crown jewels because these are the apps that are most painful for us. So that's also very exciting. But again, this will take time, but we're very committed to this, and we think this is going to drive -- help us drive long-term -- meaningful long-term growth. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, Will. And to the last part of your question on the professional services investment, we're really building out that capacity in order to meet the demand that we're seeing relative to the opportunity. We're calling it in particular because it has a gross margin impact because that's where that will typically show up. And then maybe the last thing and it's probably obvious, but just to sort of underscore it is the reason we're doing this though is for the ARR, right, to drive the new workloads, the additional workloads over to MongoDB as part of that migration. And over time, as we've talked about before, we hope and expect to be able to leverage technology more and more, but at least initially and into the medium-term, there's going to be a healthy human/services component to that. Just wanted to sort of effectively telegraph that out to folks. William Power -- Analyst That's helpful. Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Will. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Rudy Kessinger of DA Davidson. Please go ahead. Rudy Kessinger -- Analyst Hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in here. I believe last quarter you said consumption growth slightly ahead of expectations. And while down slower year-over-year growth versus Q2 last year, the year-over-year growth did improve from Q1. And so, I guess I'm curious for Q3, could you make a comment in that same regard? Obviously, slower on a year-over-year basis than Q3 last year, but was it stable with year-over-year consumption growth in Q2 or better or worse? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Rudy, thanks for the question. We haven't specifically called that out relative to Q2. We did see a lower year-over-year growth as we called out. We did see a seasonal rebound. Usually Q3 is stronger than Q2 and we talked about how that was smaller than in the prior year. So hopefully, that will help you all triangulate. Rudy Kessinger -- Analyst Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. I believe it was on your Q4 call back in March. At that point, Dev, you said it would be at least another year until AI applications are being deployed at scale. It sounds like the commentary that some early large workloads, but out of the thousands, just not many that are at large scale. I guess, is your expectation now that maybe it's still at least another year until we're seeing broad AI application rollouts at scale? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I think a lot of it's a function of the what's happening in the R&D side of AI, right? So for example, today, we don't have a very compelling model designed for our phones, right, because today the phones don't have the computing horsepower to run complex models. So, you don't see a ton of very, very successful consumer apps besides, say, ChatGPT or Claude. So we don't -- we also don't see like hundreds of apps taking off like you saw kind of the first generation of like the Internet or the cloud era, right, or the mobile era. So like I think we're still in the early days of AI. And so while we see a lot of people building AI apps, a lot of them have kind of fairly rudimentary functionality. But I think that over time that's going to change. In fact, I know it will change. I just can't predict when that will happen. But where we do see apps having production, we are having traction, we're seeing them grow very, very quickly and we have a lot of them on our platform. It's just very few of them are really have meaningful. Operator Thank you. And that concludes today's Q&A session. I would like to go ahead and turn the call back over to Dev for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, everyone. I just wanted to say we're really pleased with our Q3 results with strong new business performance and revenue exceeding expectations both -- across both Atlas and EA. We're making the necessary investments to expand our enterprise channel where we see the largest opportunity to establish MongoDB as a standard and the strongest returns on our go-to-market investments. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the progress we're making on both accelerating legacy app modernization with AI as well as establishing ourselves as a standard of the emerging AI tech stack for greenfield AI applications. And last but not least, I would like to thank Michael again for his contributions over the past 10 years and wish him well. Thank you, everyone, and we'll talk to you soon.

low spending expect transition flex. customer negligible impact revenue impact reported customer count. summarize, pleased third quarter result especially ability win new business. small share one largest fastest-growing market software number secular tailwinds, including ai back. continue investing judiciously focusing execution capture long-term opportunity. that, like open questions. operator? question & answers: operator [operator instructions] first question day coming sanjit singh morgan stanley. line open. sanjit singh -- analyst thank taking question congrats, michael, outstanding career. absolutely fantastic run mongodb. excited see next, excited take breather. congrats, michael. guess take question -- start questions, look atlas past two quarters, correct wrong, think consumption coming least modestly ahead expectations. relative seen beginning year, sort -- function sale execution? function end-user activity sort improving? what's driving least improvement atlas consumption past two quarters? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. different things. think look outlook beginning year, indicated thought would see stable atlas growth consumption standpoint. seen talked -- actually seen lower year-over-year growth based underlying consumption. -- that's incorporated q4 guide. seen q3 q4 -- sorry, q2 q3, excuse me, better expectations, still year-over-year basis. want make sure sort confusing comparative set year-over-year versus relative expectations. sanjit singh -- analyst understood. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer core it, sanjit, question really underlying usage applications. sanjit singh -- analyst yeah, make total sense. then, dev, ask ai agent question. term ai agent needing context, going set tool take actions. mean mongodb operational data store customer start roll agentic applications? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. so, talk agents, think think agents, there's jobs, there's -- sorry, there's job, there's project there's task. right now, agent rolled really focused task like say something sierra company rolling agents. right, deemed deal able create rich complex data structures. important ai ai model look isolated data points, need understand relationships, hierarchies, pattern within data. need able essentially get real-time insights. example, chatbot someone querying, customer kind trying get update order placed five minute ago may gotten confirmation, chatbot need able deal real-time information. need able deal basically handling advanced use cases, understanding like, thing like fraud detection understand behavior supply chains, need understand intricate data relationships. thing consistent mongodb offers. believe end day, well-positioned handle this. thing would say embedded natural way search vector search. oltp database, tech search vector search. that's one experience platform offer that, think real advantage. integrated leading ai framework platforms. enterprise-grade security compliance, customer run u anywhere, either 118 cloud region on-prem, huge differentiator us. sanjit singh -- analyst awesome. appreciate thoughts, dev. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, sanjit. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line taylor -- tyler radke citi. line open. tyler radke -- analyst hi, thank much taking question. and, michael, best, congratulation 10 years. going back sale execution, mean, one thing talked earlier year challenge term recently acquired workload ramping. think lot past fiscal year. curious quality workload acquisition trended year. think ramp consumption potential next year, sort look versus time year ago? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. maybe talk change made michael talk little bit consumption trends. so, make change beginning year, really wanted focus volume quality workload slight adjustment made. think change reasonable positive impact. again, early declare victory workload usually start small grow time, really pleased result seeing far. -- again, early days. obviously, know fiscal '25 workload go fiscal '26. far, good. michael, consumption? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, couple things, thanks, tyler. fiscal '24 cohort called earlier, slower growth continue. line revised expectations. made change talked -- earlier year affect fiscal '25 cohorts, early tell. those, need quarter data really see -- seeing behave differently. say talked new business environment success new business. pleased that, show kind initial piece, need see grow cohort evolve. tyler radke -- analyst great. thanks. follow-up ea side, talked outsized strength non-atlas business quarter. maybe could unpack like relative upside driven simply duration versus new business. know called duration impact year-over-year, -- feel like sort one-off feel like maybe bigger customer indexing toward ea impact way think product introducing thing like vector search stream processing onto on-prem product? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah, thank you. overall, continue find ea product resonate customers. important part run anywhere strategy continued see success people wanting increase investment mongodb. there's always multiyear component continue see that. talked beginning year fiscal '24 abnormally high amount multi-year benefit therefore, anticipating headwind quantified roughly $40 million range. talked call earlier saw large accounts, surprising amount multiyear positively benefited q3 little $15 million revenue compared saw q3 year ago. so, much headwind expecting. obviously, 606 dynamics, things, especially large deal kind meaty chunky lumpy, try call sort help people understand, there's pretty healthy kind baseline flow, ea, also multiyear. see spikes, try call you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. want add, tyler, investing call ea business. first, starting investing search vector search community product. couple thing us. one, whenever anyone start mongodb open-source product, immediately get benefit complete highly integrated platform. two, capability migrate ea. so, ea u investment strategy. definitely see lot large customer very, committed running workload on-prem. even see customer want run run ai workload on-prem. so, optionality get using mongodb on-prem cloud, also cross-cloud compelling one. tyler radke -- analyst thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line brad reback stifel. line open. brad reback -- analyst great. thanks much. and, michael, best luck. great run. dev, started call talking bunch investments, great given growth business. obviously, talked reallocating expenses. net-net, think incremental investment phase next year gating margin upside? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer think that's something obviously ready talk next year now, would say -- reason looking invest summarize again, going up-market legacy app modernization see large workload potentially play ideal database genai apps, future important investment drive long-term growth. quite energized investment that's something high conviction on. brad reback -- analyst that's great. maap program, workload going wind atlas healthy combination ea atlas? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer think early days. would say -- would probably say side atlas ea early days. think introduce search vector search ea product, see on-prem. obviously, people use mongodb ai workload using technology well conjunction mongodb on-prem ai use cases. would say probably going see happen first atlas. brad reback -- analyst great. thanks much. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line jason ader william blair. line open. jason ader -- analyst yeah, thank you. going belabor congratulating michael, fun working best luck. question strength ea. think, dev, represents comment enterprise might rethinking reassessing kind on-prem versus cloud workload placement decision? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer well, think large enterprises, think large enterprise meaningful workload still running on-prem. think belief everything would go cloud probably something really popular good old day zurp. think customer assess investment already place, much judicious run workload think leverage existing investment infrastructure, going so. also bunch reason like regulatory reasons, customer quite moving aggressively cloud. see particularly europe, see lot european bank still running majority workload on-prem. also varies region conversely asia, seeing people much move much aggressively cloud. think really depends industry, geography, personal dynamic what's happening particular account. mean, see large u bank also committed running thing on-prem. really varies. that's feel really good run anywhere strategy give customer optionality. build something run on-prem. choose move cloud, easy mongodb. jason ader -- analyst right. follow-up also investment making strategic sale enterprise. could get little specific investment might be? hiring lot new salespeople? working sis, investing sis? additional detail would helpful. thanks. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. everyone's benefit, identified number accounts, call strategic accounts, think high upside us. seen number account grow quickly deploy right mix resources. necessarily quota-carrying resources. could additional technical sale resources, additional p resources, additional customer service resource better service support accounts. even thing like run education session developer accounts, called either hackathons like call developer day even design review meet development team looking build application, help think would potentially use mongodb build particular app. find many developers, experience mongodb quite limited, engage them, educate show simple easy is. like example, customer today think like use oltp database, search database, maybe vector database, like caching database. integrated mongodb. sudden, customer say, wow, simplify life, simplify back-end infrastructure, build app far quickly much easier manage long-term everything mongodb. really function educating power mongodb really open lot opportunity us. that's doubling down, mix resource really predicated accounts, quota counting resources, whole suite resource bringing table. jason ader -- analyst thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line andrew nowinski well fargo. line open. andrew nowinski -- analyst okay. good afternoon. thank much taking question congrats nice quarter. gave example customer migrated postgres think said issue pg vector function. wondering long customer using postgres decided make change mongo, meaning sort like rebound type customer chose pg -- excuse me, postgres work? frequently seeing type transition? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. can't give specific long using postgres, -- trend seeing business. remember postgres 40-year-old technology. -- beneficiary people lifting shifting type relational databases, oracle, sql server, mysql, et cetera. open-source database. part -- open-source relational database, inherent challenge relational database do. quite inflexible. build schema, hard change schema. hard scale hard distribute data. large data volumes, weird thing like, example, resort off-road storage large data objects, creates performance bottlenecks. again, people default postgres know anything better know relational everyone kind moving relational platforms. that's whole point saying earlier. educate developer flexibility schema, easily horizontally scale rich query language aggregation sophisticated geospatial indexes, productivity gain using document model easy organize data, -- people like, wow, life much easier. want clear, zero-sum game. postgres fail u successful. big market quite excited opportunity, see customer moving postgres coming mongodb. andrew nowinski -- analyst thank you. helpful. maybe quick follow-up. normalize $15 million multiyear deal impact q3, would ea still sequentially q4? thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer given level guidance, trying help understand context full-year number headwind talked beginning year, given strength saw q3. andrew nowinski -- analyst got it. thanks. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line raimo lenschow barclays. line open. raimo lenschow -- analyst hey, thank you. think ea strength quarter, michael, kind give u little bit there. like think renewal -- renewal situation renewal pool coming like q3, coming q4, et cetera, well like mean term upsell, cross-sell opportunity people think starting ai project self-serve, kind mentioned earlier call? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. think -- think ea q4, tends large renewal quarter, talking term guide strength multiyear, that's would expect see ea sequentially, typically pattern, called out. term ai workload things, think early tell obviously, continue evolve assess view get full-year guide march. also updated view cohort behaving sort multiyear played out. think term q4, comment made earlier hopefully help. raimo lenschow -- analyst yeah. okay, perfect. -- talk little bit like obviously, there's debate like database persistent layer ai projects, et cetera. see big hyperscalers term working guy partnerships? obviously aws kind summit, et-cetera. speak little bit like relationship big guy evolving around this? michael, best case talk you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. so, start partnership first, like -- aws, said, re:invent show last week. -- remains very, strong. closed ton deal past quarter. very, large deals. integration new product like q bedrock engagement field really strong. azure, think -- shared past, start-off little bit slow start, word person run partner leadership, azure mongodb relationship never stronger. closed large number deals. part what's called azure native ic service program bunch deep integration azure, including fabric, power bi, visual studio, semantic kernel, azure openai studio. also one azure's largest marketplace partners. gcp -- actually seen uptick term co-sales done past quarter gcp made comp change -- favorable working mongodb saw result field, focused closing -- closing handful large deal gcp q4. general, would say, thing going quite well. term of, guess, implying question like hyperscalers potentially bundling thing along ai offerings? mean, candidly, since day one, hyperscalers bundling database offering every offering that's predominant strategy. -- think executed well strategy database like by-the-way decision. important decision. think hyperscalers seeing performance realize better partner us. said, customer understand importance data layer, especially ai applications. partnership across three hyperscalers strong. raimo lenschow -- analyst ok, perfect. thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer thanks, raimo. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line brad sill bank america. line open. brad sill -- analyst great. thank much, congratulations, michael, next move. wanted ask new workload vector search, stream processing, relational migrator. one three that's ramping faster maybe expected? little bit color new workload type ramping. thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. kind give rundown -- mean, essentially asking new products, like -- search, introduced new capability called atlas search nodes, asymmetrically scale search node search-intensive use case, scale node become quite expensive. seen kind groundbreaking capability really well received. demand quite high customer like tune configuration unique need search requirements. one world's largest bank using atlas search provide like google-like search experience payment data massive corporate customers. customer-facing application performance, scalability critical. leading provider ai-powered accounting software us atlas search power invoice analytics future, allows end user finance team perform ad-hoc analysis easily find past-due invoice voice contain errors. search -- vector search, -- again, kind first full-year since going generally available. product uptake actually very, high. q3, released quantization atlas vector search, reduces memory requirement 96%, allowing u support larger vector workload vastly improved price performance. example, multinational news organization created genai powered tool designed help producer journalist efficiently search, summarize, verify information vast varied data sources. leading security firm using atlas vector search fight ai fraud leading global medium company replaced elastic search hybrid search vector search use case user recommendation engine that's built suggest -- that's built suggest article end users. that's super exciting see well. also seeing lot interest streaming product, demand high. rolled another hyperscaler, customer commenting use case able embed stream processing mongodb make life much easier. overall, quite pleased progress making new products. said before, natively bundling capability really reduces eliminates need customer bolt bunch different technology solve problem, saving lot time, money, cost, risk. brad sill -- analyst that's really exciting. thanks, dev. wanted ask question around cedric's appointment. focus may different leadership thinking going forward? thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer no, cedric cro for, gosh, like think like five, six years, -- interim cro three quarter took last made change really expansion responsibilities. known cedric long time. worked multiple different companies. think good barometer understanding sale leadership. there's number sale leader worked top-tier software company used work me. super-excited role cedric going take also making change cedric better align different organization tightly work together going up-market, app monetization positioning well ideal database genai apps. brad sill -- analyst super exciting. thanks, dev. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer thanks, brad. operator thank you. one moment next question, please. next question coming line mike cikos needham company. line open. mike cikos -- analyst hey guys, thanks taking question here. wanted come back consumption growth slightly better expectation second quarter row now. apology missed it, improvement seeing, across vintage geography potentially concentrated scope? trying get better understanding what's seeking place what's embedded guide. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. no, would describe broad-based, mike. obviously, pleased see continuing monitoring slicing dicing different ways. information insight you, share it. without trying throw whole bunch cold water mind, slightly better, step-function changed better, good see. mike cikos -- analyst terrific. maybe quick follow-up dev. think build maybe tyler's question top q&a, cited customer thinking workload holistically even looking run ai workload on-prem. much think function customer still trying figure optimize latency cost demonstration really early phase exploratory phase versus going production? way coarse two necessarily connected? thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer no, think kind little bit both. think customer committed running big part estate on-prem. definition, going build ai workload, run on-prem, mean also need access gpus that. customer leveraging basically renting gpus cloud provider building ai workloads. think very, early days. still learning, experimenting. more-and-more apps entering production. said prepared remarks, thousand workload -- ai workload running mongodb, small percentage demonstrated meaningful product market fit. initial traction kind still small. think people get sophisticated ai, ai technology matures becomes useful, think application -- start seeing application take-off. kind chuckled today see senior leader bragging chip using versus apps building. tell still very, early day big platform shift. mike cikos -- analyst great point. thank again, guys. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, mike. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line eric heath keybanc. line open. eric heath -- analyst hi, thanks taking question. dev, michael, sound like takeaway call greater focus ea enterprise. structurally rethink ea business differently think healthy double-digit growth business going forward foreseeable future? could ask follow-up question separate that. michael, understand still early identify fiscal '25 cohort workloads, curious high-level look feel like higher quality fiscal '24 cohort workflow. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer want take first one term ea... michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, mean, would say, mean, committed run anywhere strategy. said, first investing community many customer first way experience mongodb. want full experience integrating search vector search core product. gate really start building applications. transition building capability ea. so, clearly investing ea product. atlas still big, big part business big, big part growth engine typically launch new feature atlas capability already have, fact multi-cloud make very, compelling offering many customers. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. think term workloads, think early. reminder folks, tend start small, although grow quickly. think thing add is, pretty consistent pleased new business done. need time let cohort play track them. think like said, happy new business winning. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line william power baird. line open. brian raferty denyeau -- investor relation there, william? william power -- analyst sorry, yeah. thank you. dev, encouraging comment relational migrator. wonder could touch think driving higher interest here. mean, sound like ai contributing helping, great get color still feel like obviously meaningful long-term opportunity. maybe second part question dev michael, great get framework around professional service investments. way kind think quantification timing that? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. reason excited opportunity go legacy application that, one, seems like there's confluence event happening. one increasing cost tax supporting managing legacy apps going enough. second, many customer regulated industries, regulator calling -- fact running legacy apps systemic risk, longer kick road. third, also longer kick around, vendor going end-of-life, make decision migrate application modern tech stack. fourth, genai predicated data build competitive advantage, need leverage proprietary data, people want access data able easily. that's another reason want modernize. also people built application retiring longer firm, creates risk companies. given that, customer incredibly interested figuring way easily safely securely migrate -- applications. always could help easily move data map schema relational schema document schema. hardest part essentially rewriting application. advent genai, significantly reduce time. one, use genai analyze existing code. two, use genai reverse engineer test test code does. three, use genai build new code user test ensure new code produce result old code. time effort suddenly cut meaningful way that's suddenly creating lot interest customer saying, goodness. already relational app, moving another relational app feel like modernization. so, advantage moving mongodb give much modern platform, much agile, flexible, performant, scalable platform future needs. that's excited. again, early days. run number pilot gone well. process working customer migration process. take time very, complex applications. actually, one thing also mentioned going -- saying go tertiary tier 2 tier 3 application, saying, hey, want look crown jewel apps painful us. that's also exciting. again, take time, committed this, think going drive -- help u drive long-term -- meaningful long-term growth. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, will. last part question professional service investment, really building capacity order meet demand seeing relative opportunity. calling particular gross margin impact that's typically show up. maybe last thing probably obvious, sort underscore reason though arr, right, drive new workloads, additional workload mongodb part migration. time, talked before, hope expect able leverage technology more, least initially medium-term, there's going healthy human/services component that. wanted sort effectively telegraph folks. william power -- analyst that's helpful. thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, will. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line rudy kessinger da davidson. please go ahead. rudy kessinger -- analyst hey guys, thanks squeezing here. believe last quarter said consumption growth slightly ahead expectations. slower year-over-year growth versus q2 last year, year-over-year growth improve q1. so, guess curious q3, could make comment regard? obviously, slower year-over-year basis q3 last year, stable year-over-year consumption growth q2 better worse? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. rudy, thanks question. specifically called relative q2. see lower year-over-year growth called out. see seasonal rebound. usually q3 stronger q2 talked smaller prior year. hopefully, help triangulate. rudy kessinger -- analyst okay. quick follow-up. believe q4 call back march. point, dev, said would least another year ai application deployed scale. sound like commentary early large workloads, thousands, many large scale. guess, expectation maybe still least another year seeing broad ai application rollouts scale? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. think lot function what's happening r&d side ai, right? example, today, compelling model designed phones, right, today phone computing horsepower run complex models. so, see ton very, successful consumer apps besides, say, chatgpt claude. -- also see like hundred apps taking like saw kind first generation like internet cloud era, right, mobile era. like think still early day ai. see lot people building ai apps, lot kind fairly rudimentary functionality. think time that's going change. fact, know change. can't predict happen. see apps production, traction, seeing grow very, quickly lot platform. really meaningful. operator thank you. concludes today's q&a session. would like go ahead turn call back dev closing remarks. please go ahead. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief

Welcome to the MongoDB third-quarter fiscal year 2025 conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there'll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your speaker for today, Brian Denyeau. Please go ahead. Brian Raferty Denyeau -- Investor Relations Thank you, Lisa. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today to review MongoDB's third-quarter fiscal 2025 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued after the close of the market today. Joining me the call today are Dev Ittycheria, president and CEO of MongoDB; and Michael Gordon, MongoDB's COO and CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our market and future growth opportunities, our expectations for the macroeconomic environment in fiscal 2025 and the impact of AI, the benefits of our product platform, our competitive landscape, customer behaviors, our financial guidance, and our planned investments in growth opportunities in AI. These statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including the results of operations and financial condition that cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. For a discussion of the material risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please refer to the risks described in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 31st, 2024 that we filed with the SEC on August 30th, 2024. Any forward-looking statements made on this call reflect our views only as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them except as required by law. Additionally, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures on this conference call. Please refer to the tables in our earnings release in the Investor Relations portion of our website for a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dev. Dev? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we had a strong quarter of new business and executed well against our large market opportunity. Let's begin by reviewing our third quarter results before giving you a broader company update. We generated revenue of $529 million, a 22% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew 26% year-over-year, representing 68% of total revenue. We generated non-GAAP operating income of $101 million for a 19% non-GAAP operating margin and we ended the quarter with over 52,600 customers. Overall, we were pleased with our performance in the third quarter. We had a strong new business quarter and we're happy with our new workload acquisition on Atlas. Our non-Atlas business significantly exceeded expectations in part because we benefited from a few large multi-year deals as customers continue to value our run anywhere strategy and want to build a deeper longer-term relationship with MongoDB. Atlas consumption was slightly better than expected in a macro-environment that we would characterize as largely consistent with what we saw in the first half of the year. Michael will cover consumption trends in more detail. Retention rates remained strong in Q3, demonstrating the mission criticality of our platform. On our Q1 earnings call, we shared with you the three major strategic initiatives that we believe will enable us to maximize our long-term opportunity. I want to give you an update on the progress we're making on those initiatives. First, we are increasing our investment in the enterprise channel since we see the strongest returns in this part of the market. Specifically, we're expanding our strategic account program going to next year, as we see more accounts that will benefit from incremental investment. In addition, we're investing time and resources to educate developers in large enterprise accounts and uplevel their MongoDB skills. These organizations have thousands of developers and as we penetrate them more deeply, we encounter developers who have historically only built SQL applications and simply do not know how to use MongoDB to its full potential. In our experience, educating these developers on the benefits of MongoDB drives significant incremental adoption of our platform. To fund these up-market investments, we are reallocating a portion of our mid-market investments. The mid-market remains an attractive opportunity for us, but we believe that prioritizing investment up-market will deliver strong returns in the current environment. We also believe there are additional ways to serve the mid-market more efficiently through our self-serve channel and other scaled technology-enabled sales and customer service motions. Second, we are optimistic about the opportunity to accelerate legacy app modernization using AI and are investing more in this area. As you recall, we ran a few successful pilots earlier this year, demonstrating that AI tooling combined with professional services and our relational migrator product can significantly reduce the time, cost, and risk of migrating legacy applications onto MongoDB. While it's early days, we have observed a more than 50% reduction in the cost to modernize. On the back of these strong early results, additional customer interest is exceeding our expectations. Large enterprises in every industry and geography are experiencing acute pain from their legacy infrastructure and are eager for more agile, performant, and cost-effective solutions. Not only are customers excited to engage with us, they also want to focus on some of the most important applications in their enterprise, further demonstrating the level of interest and size of the long-term opportunity. As relational applications encompass a wide variety of database types, programming languages, versions, and other customer-specific variables, we expect modernization projects to continue to include meaningful service engagements in the short and medium term. Consequently, we're increasing our professional services delivery capabilities, both directly and through partners. In the long run, we expect to automate and simplify large parts of the modernization process. To that end, we are leveraging the learnings from early service engagement to develop new tools to accelerate future modernization efforts. Although it's early days and scaling our legacy app modernization capabilities will take time, we have increased conviction that this motion will significantly add to our growth in the long term. Third, we are investing to capitalize on our inherent technical advantages as a key component of the emerging AI tech stack. As a reminder, MongoDB is uniquely equipped to query rich and complex data structures typical of AI applications. The ability of a database to query rich and complex data structures is crucial because AI applications often rely on highly detailed, interrelated, and nuanced data to make accurate predictions and decisions. For example, a recommendation system doesn't just analyze a single customer's purchase but also considers their browsing history, peer group behavior, and product categories requiring a database that can query and interlink these complex data structures. In addition, MongoDB's architecture unifies source data, metadata, operational data, and vector data in an all-in-one platform, updating the need for multiple database systems and complex back-end architectures. This enables a more compelling developer experience than any other alternative. From what we see in the AI market today, most customers are still in the experimental stage as they work to understand the effectiveness of the underlying tech stack and build early proof-of-concept applications. However, we are seeing an increasing number of AI apps in production. Today, we have thousands of AI apps on our platform. What we don't yet see is many of these apps actually achieving meaningful product market fit and therefore significant traction. In fact, as you take a step back and look at the entire universe of AI apps, a very small percentage of them have achieved the type of scale that we commonly see with enterprise-specific applications. We do have some AI apps that are growing quickly, including one that is already a seven-figure workload that has grown 10 times since the beginning of the year. Similar to prior platform shifts as the usefulness of AI tech improves and becomes more cost-effective, we will see the emergence of many more AI apps that do nail product market fit, but it's difficult to predict when that will happen more broadly. We remain confident that we will capture our fair share of these successful AI applications as we see that our platform is popular with developers building more sophisticated AI use cases. We continue investing in our product capabilities, including enterprise-grade Atlas Vector Search functionality to build on this momentum and even better position MongoDB to capture the AI opportunity. In addition, as previously announced, we are bringing search and vector service to our community and EA offerings, leveraging our run anywhere competitive advantage in the world of AI. Finally, we are expanding our MongoDB AI applications program or MAAP, which helps enterprise customers build and bring AI applications into production by providing them with reference architectures, integrations with leading tech providers, and coordinated services and support. Last week, we announced a new code of partners including McKinsey, Confluent, Capgemini, and Unstructured, as well as the collaboration with Meta to enable developers to build AI-enriched applications on MongoDB using Llama. Next, I'd like to provide you with a brief product update. At our dot local developer conference in London in October, we announced the general availability of MongoDB 8.0, the fastest and most performant version of MongoDB ever. MongoDB 8.0 performs 20% to 60% better against common industry benchmarks compared to our prior version and is built to exceed our customers' most stringent security, resiliency, availability, and performance requirements. To best serve our customers, we regularly review and reprioritize investments in our product portfolio to ensure we're allocating our resources to products with the highest demand from our customers. And to do that, we also deprecate products that are not showing results we desired. Consequently, we made the decision to consolidate our Atlas serverless offerings with our smallest dedicated tiers to create Atlas Flex customers, a new offering with a simpler architecture that provides the elasticity features akin to serverless. We will begin migrating effective customers to the single, simple, entry-level solution in Q4. We also decided to deprecate Atlas DeviceSync and other capabilities not widely adopted in order to focus our engineering resources on the core platform. While these reprioritization decisions are not made lightly, they allow us to deliver the most value to the largest number of customers, reinforcing our commitment to being the best modern database and helping us to grow faster. Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the adoption trends of MongoDB across our customer base. Customers across industries and around the world are running mission-critical projects in MongoDB Atlas, leveraging the full power of our developer data platform, including Financial Times, CarGurus, and Victoria's Secret. As part of the digital transformation journey, global specialty retailer Victoria's Secret & Company migrated its e-commerce platform to MongoDB Atlas. As a fully managed platform, MongoDB Atlas allowed the company to simplify its architecture and improve performance, supporting the retailer to provide a resilient, secure, and fast web and mobile e-commerce experience for their millions of customers around the world. Allianz, Alphamad, Swiss Post, and Paylocity are turning to MongoDB to modernize applications. Paylocity, a leading provider of cloud-based payroll and human capital management software, selected MongoDB to power proprietary application aimed at fostering employee connections and engagement. When traffic increased and the original SQL-based solution was unable to keep up with the required performance metrics, Paylocity migrated to MongoDB Atlas to take advantage of the flexible schema architecture, performance, and scalability. MongoDB costs five times less than the previous SQL database solution and the company's developers can now create an application within minutes, something that used to take weeks. Mature companies and start-ups alike are using MongoDB to help deliver the next wave of AI-powered application to customers, including NerdWallet, Cisco, and Tealbook. Tealbook, a supplier intelligence platform, migrated from Postgres, pgvector, and ElasticSearch to MongoDB to eliminate technical debt and consolidate their tech stack. The company experienced workload isolation and scalability issues in pgvector and were concerned with the search index inconsistencies, which were all resolved with the migration to MongoDB. With Atlas Vector search and dedicated search nodes, Tealbook has realized improved cost-efficiency and increased scalability for the supplier data platform, an application that uses GenAI to collect, verify, and enrich supplier data across various sources. In summary, we had a healthy Q3 with both Atlas and EA exceeding expectations. We saw a strong new business quarter and we remain confident in our ability to become an increasing strategic provider in our large and growing market. Looking forward, we see a great opportunity to grow our adoption in the enterprise through new workloads, modernizing legacy applications, and winning the next generation of AI-powered applications. I would like to finish by providing an update on our senior leadership. First, as we announced early in the press release, after nearly 10 years, Michael Gordon has made the decision to leave MongoDB. Michael has been instrumental in MongoDB's success over the past decade, leading our successful IPO, helping us grow our revenue nearly 50-fold, and scaling -- and successfully scaling our business model to generate meaningful operating leverage. He has been a trusted advisor and business partner to the Board and me over the years and also has become a personal friend. Michael is excited to take a well-deserved break. We have commenced the search for Michael's replacement and will be evaluating both internal and external candidates. One of Michael's proudest compliments -- accomplishments has been building a world-class finance team under his leadership, and I'm confident that we will not miss a beat during this transition. Michael will continue to serve as CFO through January 31st to help us finish the fiscal year and then will transition to an Advisor to the company to ensure a seamless process. If we have not named Michael's successor by fiscal year-end, Serge Tanjga, SVP of Finance, will serve as Interim CFO, beginning on February 1st. Second, we are promoting Cedric Pech, currently our chief revenue officer to the newly created role of president worldwide field operations. In this new position, Cedric will oversee all our field-based customer-facing and go-to-market enablement teams, including professional services. We believe this org structure will best enable us to execute on some of the key strategic initiatives I discussed earlier, in particular, our increased focus on up-market and the app monetization opportunity. I would like to congratulate Cedric on this well-deserved promotion. With that, let me turn the call over to Michael. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Dev, and thanks for the kind words and our incredible partnership over the past decade. The past 10 years have been the most rewarding in my professional career and I'm extremely proud of what we've achieved together and of course, to the whole MongoDB team. With as much success as we had, I still believe that MongoDB is in the early stages of realizing its full potential as it continues to take share in one of the largest markets in software. Now, turning to the results for the quarter. I'll begin with a detailed review of our third-quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025. First, I'll start with our third quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $529.4 million, up 22% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance. Shifting to our product mix, Atlas grew 26% in the quarter compared to the previous year and now represents 68% of total revenue compared to 66% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and 71% last quarter. We recognized Atlas revenue primarily based on customer consumption of our platform and that consumption is closely tied to end user activity of their applications. Let me provide some context on Atlas consumption in the quarter. In Q3, consumption was slightly ahead of our expectations. This year's Q3 seasonal improvement was more muted than in years past as expected. On a year-over-year basis, consumption growth remains below that of prior year period. Turning to non-Atlas revenue. Non-Atlas came in significantly ahead of our expectations. As Dev mentioned, EA new business was strong, and we continue to have success selling incremental workloads into our existing customer base. In addition, our Q3 non-Atlas revenue benefited from a few large multi-year deals. As you know, due to ASC 606, we recognized the entire term license component of a multi-year contract at the start of that contract. Compared to Q3 of last year, the multi-year license component of non-Atlas revenues was over $15 million higher. Turning to customer growth. During the third quarter, we grew our customer base by approximately 1,900 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 52,600, which is up from over 46,400 in the year-ago period. Of our total customer count, over 7,400 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 6,900 in the year-ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven primarily by Atlas, which had over 51,100 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 44,900 in the year-ago period. It is important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers adding their first Atlas workload. Continuing on, in Q3, our net ARR expansion rate was approximately 120%. We ended the quarter with 2,314 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, up from $1,972 in the year-ago period. Moving down the income statement, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the third quarter was $405.7 million, representing a gross margin of 77%, which is flat versus the year-ago period. Our income from operations was $101.5 million or 19% operating margin for the third quarter compared to an 18% operating margin in the year-ago period. The primary reason for more favorable operating income results versus guidance is our revenue outperformance, including the very high margin multi-year license revenue benefit. Net income in the third quarter was $98.1 million or $1.16 per share, based on 84.2 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a net income of $79.1 million or $0.96 per share on 83.7 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding in the year-ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the third quarter with $2.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $37.4 million. After taking into consideration approximately $2.9 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was $34.6 million in the quarter. This compares to free cash flow of $35 million in the year-ago period. In Q3, we did not incur capital expenditures to purchase IPV4 addresses as we previously expected, but we did start making those purchases in November and still expect a total outlay of $20 million to $25 million this fiscal year as we previously communicated. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $515 million to $519 million. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $55 million to $58 million and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.65 based on 84.9 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. For the full-fiscal year 2025, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.973 billion to $1.977 billion, non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $242 million to $245 million, and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $3.01 to $3.03 based on 84 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. Note that the non-GAAP net income per share guidance for the fourth-quarter and full-fiscal year 2025 includes a non-GAAP tax provision of approximately 20%. I'll now provide some more context around our updated guidance. First, in terms of Atlas consumption, we expect to see a typical seasonal slowdown in Q4, driven by underlying application usage moderating during the holiday season. Second, since Atlas consumption remained lower on a year-over-year basis in Q3, we expect to see continued deceleration of Atlas year-over-year growth in Q4. Third, we expect to see a sequential decline in non-Atlas revenue in Q4, which is contrary to our normal pattern. The reason for this is that we experienced a significant additional benefit from multi-year deals in Q3, which we do not expect to recur in Q4. In addition, I want to provide some incremental color on some of our recent product and -- how some of our recent product and go-to-market changes will impact the growth of our reported customer count going forward. First, as Dev explained, we are reallocating a portion of our go-to-market resources from the mid-market to the enterprise channel. As a result, we expect to see significantly fewer mid-market direct sales customer net additions and as a result, slower direct sales customer growth going forward. We believe this reallocation of investment dollars will drive higher revenue growth over time. So, it's a trade-off that makes sense. Second, as we introduce Atlas Flex clusters in Q4 and automatically migrate customers in Q1, we expect to see a one-time negative impact to our customer count since we have approximately 4,000 serverless customers who are very low spending and we do not expect them to transition over to Flex. These customers have a negligible impact on our revenue but will impact our reported customer count. To summarize, we're pleased with our third quarter results and especially our ability to win new business. We have a small share in one of the largest and fastest-growing markets in all of software with a number of secular tailwinds, including AI at our back. We'll continue investing judiciously and focusing on our execution to capture this long-term opportunity. With that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator? Questions & Answers: Operator [Operator instructions] Our first question for the day will be coming from Sanjit Singh of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Thank you for taking the questions and congrats, Michael, on outstanding career. You had an absolutely fantastic run at MongoDB. I'm excited to see what you do next, or excited if you just take a breather. So congrats, Michael. I guess to take the question -- to start off with the questions, when we look at what Atlas has been doing in the past two quarters, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think consumption is coming in at least modestly ahead of your expectations. Relative to what we've seen at the beginning of the year, what sort of -- is it a function of sales execution? Is it a function of the end-user activity sort of improving? What's driving at least the improvement in Atlas consumption in the past two quarters? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So a few different things. So I think if you look at our outlook at the beginning of the year, we had indicated that we thought we would see stable Atlas growth from a consumption standpoint. What we've seen and what we've talked about is -- we've actually seen lower year-over-year growth based on the underlying consumption. And so -- and that's incorporated into our Q4 guide. We have seen the Q3 and Q4 be -- sorry, Q2 and Q3, excuse me, be better than our expectations, but it's still down on a year-over-year basis. And so I want to make sure that we're not sort of confusing the comparative set of year-over-year versus relative to our expectations. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Understood. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer And the core of it, Sanjit, to your question is really the underlying usage of the applications. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Yeah, that makes total sense. And then, Dev, I have to ask you the AI agent question. In terms of an AI agent needing more context, it has going to have a set of tools to take its actions. What does it mean for MongoDB as an operational data store as customers start to roll out more agentic applications? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, just to talk about agents, I think when you think about agents, there's jobs, there's -- sorry, there's a job, there's projects and then there's task. Right now, the agents that are being rolled out are really focused on task like say something from Sierra or some other companies are rolling out agents. But you're right, what they deemed to do is to deal with being able to create a rich and complex data structures. Now why is this important for AI is that AI models don't just look at isolated data points, but they need to understand relationships, hierarchies, and patterns within the data. They need to be able to essentially get real-time insights. For example, if you have a chatbot where someone is querying, a customer is kind of trying to get some update on the order they placed five minutes ago because they may have not gotten any confirmation, your chatbot needs to be able to deal with real-time information. You need to be able to deal with basically handling very advanced use cases, understanding like, to do things like fraud detection to understand behaviors of supply chains, you need to understand intricate data relationships. All these things are consistent with MongoDB offers. And so we believe that at the end of the day, we are well-positioned to handle this. And the other thing that I would say is that we've embedded in a very natural way of search and vector search. So we're just not an OLTP database, we do tech search and vector search. That's all one experience and no other platform offers that, and we think we have a real advantage. And so we're integrated with the leading AI frameworks and platforms. We have enterprise-grade security and compliance, and customers can run us anywhere, either on 118 cloud regions or on-prem, and that again is a huge differentiator for us. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Awesome. Appreciate the thoughts, Dev. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Sanjit. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Taylor -- Tyler Radke of Citi. Your line is open. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Hi, thank you very much for taking the question. And, Michael, all the best, and congratulations on 10 years. Going back to the sales execution, I mean, one of the things that you talked about earlier this year was some challenges just in terms of the recently acquired workloads ramping. And I think a lot of those were from the past fiscal year. So curious how the quality of workload acquisition has trended this year. And as you think about the ramp in consumption potential into next year, how does that sort of look versus this time a year ago? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Maybe I'll just talk about what we're doing and the changes we made and then Michael can talk a little bit about the consumption trends. So, we did make some changes at the beginning of the year, and we really wanted to focus on both the volume and the quality of the workloads and there were some slight adjustments that we made. We think those changes are having a reasonable positive impact. Again, it's too early to declare victory because these workloads usually start small and grow over time, but we're really pleased with the results we're seeing so far. And -- but again, it's early days. And obviously, we'll know about the fiscal '25 workloads as we go into fiscal '26. But so far, so good. Michael, on consumption? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, just a couple of things, and thanks, Tyler. The fiscal '24 cohorts that we called out earlier, that slower growth does continue. They've been in line with our revised expectations. We made some changes that we talked about at the -- earlier in the year that should affect the fiscal '25 cohorts, but it's just too early to tell. On those, we need a few more quarters of data before you can really see if we're -- how we're seeing those behave differently. I will say we've talked about the new business environment and our success in new business. We have been pleased with that, but that just shows kind of the initial piece, and we need to see how they grow and how those cohorts evolve. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Great. Thanks. And follow-up on the EA side, you talked about the outsized strength in non-Atlas business this quarter. Maybe if you could unpack like the relative upside that was driven by simply duration versus new business. I know you called out the duration impact year-over-year, but are -- do you feel like this was sort of a one-off or do you feel like maybe some of your bigger customers are indexing more toward EA and how does that impact the way you think about the product and introducing things like vector search and stream processing onto the on-prem product? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, thank you. So overall, we continue to find the EA product resonate with customers. It's an important part of the run anywhere strategy and we've continued to see success with that and people wanting to increase their investment in MongoDB. There's always been a multiyear component and we continue to see that. We talked about that at the beginning of the year as to how fiscal '24 had an abnormally high amount of multi-year benefit and therefore, we were anticipating that being a headwind and we quantified that in roughly the $40 million range. What we talked about on this call earlier is we saw from a few large accounts, a surprising amount of multiyear that positively benefited Q3 at a little more than $15 million in revenue compared to what we saw Q3 a year ago. So, not as much of a headwind as we had been expecting. Obviously, with the 606 dynamics, some of these things, especially for a large deal can be kind of meaty and chunky and lumpy, which is why we try and call it out and sort of help people understand, but there's a pretty healthy kind of baseline flow, not just of EA, but also of multiyear. And when we see spikes, we just try and call it out for you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I just want to add, Tyler, that we are investing in our what we call our EA business. First, we're starting by investing with search and vector search and a community product. That does a couple of things for us. One, whenever anyone starts with MongoDB with the open-source product, they immediately get all the benefits of that complete highly integrated platform. Two, those capabilities will then migrate to EA. So, EA for us is an investment strategy. We definitely see lots of large customers who are very, very committed to running workloads on-prem. We even see some customers want to run to run AI workloads on-prem. So, the optionality they get by using MongoDB to not just be on-prem and the cloud, but also cross-cloud is a very compelling one. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Brad Reback of Stifel. Your line is open. Brad Reback -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. And, Michael, best of luck. It's been a great run. Dev, you started the call talking about a bunch of investments, which are great given the growth of the business. And obviously, you talked about reallocating some expenses. But net-net, should we think about this incremental investment phase next year as gating margin upside? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think that's something that we obviously are not ready to talk about next year just now, but I would say that we -- the reason we're looking to invest and just to summarize again, going up-market on legacy app modernization where we see very large workloads potentially at play and being the ideal database for GenAI apps, which is the future as important investments to drive long-term growth. And we're quite energized by those investments and that's something that we have high conviction on. Brad Reback -- Analyst That's great. And then on the MAAP program, are most of those workloads going to wind up in Atlas or will that be a healthy combination of EA and Atlas? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think it's again early days. I would say -- I would probably say more on the side of Atlas and EA in the early days. I think once we introduce a search and vector search into the EA product, you'll see more of that on-prem. Obviously, people can use MongoDB for AI workloads using other technologies as well in conjunction with MongoDB for on-prem AI use cases. But I would say you're probably going to see that happen first in Atlas. Brad Reback -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Jason Ader of William Blair. Your line is open. Jason Ader -- Analyst Yeah, thank you. I'm not going to belabor congratulating Michael, but it has been it has been fun working with you and best of luck. The question I had is on the strength in EA. Do you think, Dev, it represents a comment on how enterprises might be rethinking or reassessing the kind of on-prem versus cloud workload placement decision? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Well, when I think about large enterprises, I think large enterprises have meaningful workloads that are still running on-prem. I think the belief that everything would go to the cloud was probably something that was really popular in the good old days of Zurp. But I think now as customers assess their investments that they already have in place, they're being much more judicious about where they run those workloads and if they think they can leverage their existing investments in their own infrastructure, then they're going to do so. Also for a bunch of other reasons like regulatory reasons, some customers are quite not moving as aggressively to the cloud. We see that in particularly in Europe, where we see a lot of the European banks still running majority of the workloads on-prem. So it also varies by region where conversely in Asia, we're seeing people much move much more aggressively to the cloud. So I think it really depends on industry, on geography, and on the personal dynamics of what's happening in that particular account. I mean, we see some large US banks are also very committed to running things on-prem. So it really varies. And that's why we feel really good about our run anywhere strategy because it gives customer optionality. They can build something and run on-prem. And if and when they choose to move to the cloud, it's very easy to do so with MongoDB. Jason Ader -- Analyst All right. And then just as a follow-up also on the investments you're making in strategic sales and enterprise. Could you just get a little more specific on what those investments might be? Is it hiring a lot of new salespeople? Is it working more with SIs, investing more in SIs? Any additional detail would be helpful. Thanks. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So just for everyone's benefit, we've identified a number of accounts, which we call strategic accounts, which we think that have high upside for us. We've seen a number of accounts that grow very quickly when we deploy the right mix of resources. Now they're all not necessarily quota-carrying resources. They could be additional technical sales resources, additional PS resources, additional customer service resources to better service and support those accounts. We even do things like run education sessions for developers of the accounts, they're called either hackathons or like what we call developer days or even design reviews where we'll meet with our development teams who are looking to build an application, help them think about how they would potentially use MongoDB to build that particular app. And what we find is that because many of these developers, the experience with MongoDB is quite limited, the more we can engage with them, the more we can educate them and the more we can show them how simple and easy it is. Like for example, most customers today think like they have to use an OLTP database, then a search database, maybe a vector database, and then like a caching database. And all that is integrated in MongoDB. So all of a sudden, customers can say, wow, I can simplify my life, simplify my back-end infrastructure, build this app far more quickly and it will be much more easier to manage long-term if I do everything on MongoDB. And it's really a function of just educating them on the power of MongoDB that really opens up a lot of opportunities for us. So that's why we're doubling down, and the mix of resources is really predicated on the accounts, but it's not just quota counting resources, it's the whole suite of resources that we're bringing to the table. Jason Ader -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Andrew Nowinski of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Okay. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking the question and congrats on a nice quarter. You gave an example of a customer that migrated off Postgres and I think you said they had issues with their PG vector function. I was wondering how long was that customer using Postgres before they decided to make a change to Mongo, meaning was this some sort of like a rebound type customer where they chose PG -- or excuse me, Postgres and it didn't work? And then how frequently are you seeing this type of transition? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So I can't give you the specifics on how long they were using Postgres, but this is not -- this is a trend that we're seeing in our business. You have to remember Postgres is a 40-year-old technology. It's -- and they have been the beneficiary of people lifting and shifting from other types of relational databases, Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, et cetera. And they're an open-source database. And but as part -- because they're an open-source and relational database, they have the same inherent challenges all relational databases do. They're quite inflexible. So once you build a schema, it's very hard to change the schema. It's hard to scale and hard to distribute data. And if you have large data volumes, you have to do weird things like, for example, resort to off-road storage for large data objects, which creates performance bottlenecks. And so again, people default to Postgres if they don't know anything better because all they know is relational and everyone is kind of moving off those other relational platforms. And that's the whole point I was saying earlier. Once we educate developers on the flexibility of schema, how easily or horizontally scale the rich query language where you can do aggregations and do sophisticated geospatial indexes, the productivity gains by using the document model and how easy is to organize data, it's -- people are just like, wow, life is so much easier. Now I want to be clear, this is not a zero-sum game. Postgres does not have to fail for us to be successful. It's a big market and we're quite excited about the opportunity, but we do see customers moving off Postgres and coming to MongoDB. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Thank you. That was very helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up. If we normalize the $15 million multiyear deal impact you had in Q3, would EA still be down sequentially in Q4? Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer We haven't given that level of guidance, but just trying to help you understand in the context of the full-year numbers and the headwind that we talked about at the beginning of the year, just given the strength that we saw in Q3. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Got it. Thanks. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. The next question will be coming from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst Hey, thank you. And if you think about the EA strength this quarter, Michael, you'd kind of give us a little bit there. Like how should we think about renewal -- the renewal situation renewal pool coming up like or that you had in Q3, coming up in Q4, et cetera, as well and then like what does it mean in terms of upsell, cross-sell opportunity as people think about starting AI projects by self-serve, as you kind of mentioned earlier on the call? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So I think about -- if you think about EA for Q4, it tends to be a large renewal quarter, but what we're talking about in terms of the guide is because we had such strength in multiyear, that's where we would expect to see our EA down sequentially, which is not typically our pattern, which is why we called it out. In terms of AI workloads and some of those other things, I think it's early to tell and obviously, we'll continue to evolve and assess our view when we get to the full-year guide in March. And then we'll also have an updated view on how the cohorts are behaving and sort of how multiyear played out. But I think in terms of Q4, the comments that I made earlier hopefully will help. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst Yeah. Okay, perfect. And then the -- and can you talk a little bit about like obviously, there's a debate of like which database will be the persistent layer if you do AI projects, et cetera. What do you see from the big hyperscalers in terms of working with you guys and partnerships? We obviously just have AWS kind of summit, et-cetera. Can you speak a little bit like how your relationship with those big guys is evolving around this? And Michael, All the best in case I don't talk to you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, I'll start with the partnerships first, like our -- with AWS, as you said, they just had their re:Invent show last week. Our -- it remains very, very strong. We've closed a ton of deals this past quarter. Some of them very, very large deals. We're doing integrations to some of the new products like Q and Bedrock and the engagement in the field has been really strong. On Azure, I think we -- as I've shared in the past, we start-off with a little bit of a slow start, but in the words of the person who runs their partner leadership, the Azure MongoDB relationship has never been stronger. We've closed a large number of deals. We're part of what's called the Azure native IC service program and have a bunch of deep integrations with Azure, including Fabric, Power BI, Visual Studio, Semantic Kernel, and Azure OpenAI Studio. And we're also one of Azure's largest marketplace partners. And GCP does -- we have actually seen some uptick in terms of co-sales that we've done this past quarter and GCP made some comp changes where they -- that were favorable to working with MongoDB that we saw some results in the field, and we're focused on closing on -- closing a handful of large deals with GCP in Q4. So in general, I would say, things are going quite well. And then in terms of, I guess, implying your question was like the hyperscalers and are they potentially bundling things along with their AI offerings? I mean, candidly, since day one, the hyperscalers have been bundling their database offerings with every offering that they have and that's been their predominant strategy. And we've -- I think we've executed well against strategy because databases are not like a by-the-way decision. It's an important decision. And I think the hyperscalers are seeing our performance and realize it's better to partner with us. And as I said, customers understand the importance of the data layer, especially for AI applications. And so the partnership across all three hyperscalers is strong. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst OK, perfect. Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Raimo. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. The next question will be coming from the line of Brad Sills of Bank of America. Your line is open. Brad Sills -- Analyst Great. Thank you so much, and congratulations, Michael, on your next move. I wanted to ask about new workloads here on vector search, stream processing, relational migrator. Is there any one of those three that's ramping faster than maybe you expected? Just a little bit of color on how those new workload types are ramping. Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I'll kind of give you just a rundown of some of the -- I mean, essentially you're asking about the new products, like our -- on search, we introduced a new capability called Atlas search nodes, which where you can asymmetrically scale your search nodes because if you have a search-intensive use case, you don't have to scale all your nodes because they have become quite expensive. And we've seen that this kind of groundbreaking capability really well received. The demand is quite high and because customers like they can tune the configuration to the unique needs of their search requirements. One of the world's largest banks is using Atlas Search to provide like a Google-like search experience on payments data for massive corporate customers. So this is a customer-facing application and so performance, and scalability are critical. A leading provider of AI-powered accounting software uses Atlas Search to power its invoice analytics future, which allows end users and finance teams to perform ad-hoc analysis and easily find past-due invoices and voices that contain errors. So that search -- on vector search, it -- again, and it's been our kind of our first full-year since going generally available. And the product uptake has been actually very, very high. In Q3, we released quantization for Atlas Vector Search, which reduces the memory requirements by up to 96%, allowing us to support larger vector workloads with vastly improved price performance. For example, a multinational news organization created a GenAI powered tool designed to help producers and journalists efficiently search, summarize, and verify information from vast and varied data sources. A leading security firm is using Atlas Vector Search to fight AI fraud and a leading global media company replaced elastic search with hybrid search and vector search use case for a user recommendation engine that's built to suggest -- that's built in to suggest articles to end users. And so that's super exciting to see as well. We're also seeing a lot of interest in our streaming product, demand is very high. We just rolled it out to another hyperscaler, and customers are commenting on that the use cases of being able to embed stream processing with MongoDB makes our life so much easier. So overall, we're quite pleased with the progress we're making on the new products. And as I said before, natively bundling all these capabilities really reduces or eliminates the need for customers to have to bolt on a bunch of different technologies to solve the same problem, saving them a lot of time, money, cost, and risk. Brad Sills -- Analyst That's really exciting. Thanks, Dev. And then I wanted to ask a question around Cedric's appointment. Any focus that may be different here under his leadership that we should be thinking about going forward? Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer No, Cedric has been our CRO for, gosh, now like I think like five, six years, and he -- I was the Interim CRO for about three quarters until he took over when we last made a change and this is really an expansion of his responsibilities. I've known Cedric for a long time. He and I have worked with at multiple different companies. I think I have a good barometer for understanding sales leadership. There's a number of sales leaders who worked at other top-tier software companies who used to work for me or with me. And so I'm super-excited by the role Cedric is going to take and then we're also making some changes under Cedric to better align the different organizations so that we can more tightly work together on going up-market, on app monetization and positioning ourselves well to be the ideal database for GenAI apps. Brad Sills -- Analyst Super exciting. Thanks, Dev. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Brad. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question, please. Our next question will be coming from the line of Mike Cikos of Needham and Company. Your line is open. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Hey guys, thanks for taking the question here. I just wanted to come back to the consumption growth being slightly better than expectations again for the second quarter in a row now. And apologies if I missed it, but this improvement that we're seeing, is this across all vintages and geographies or is it potentially more concentrated in scope? Just trying to get a better understanding of what's seeking place out there and what's embedded in the guide. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. No, I would describe it as broad-based, Mike. And obviously, we're pleased to see it and we're continuing monitoring and slicing and dicing it in different ways. And as we have information or insights to you, we'll share it. And without trying to throw a whole bunch of cold water on our mind, it was slightly better, or a step-function changed better, but good to see. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Terrific. And maybe for a quick follow-up for Dev. I think it builds off maybe Tyler's question at the top of the Q&A, but you had cited that some customers are thinking about their workloads more holistically and even looking to run AI workloads on-prem. How much of that do you think is just a function of customers are still trying to figure out how to optimize for latency and cost or is this more a demonstration of we really are in the early phases of the exploratory phase versus going into production? Is there any way to coarse that out or is the two not necessarily connected? Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer No, I think it's kind of a little bit of both. I think you have some customers who are very committed to running a big part of the estate on-prem. So by definition, then if they're going to build an AI workload, it has to be run on-prem, which means that they also need access to GPUs and they're doing that. And then other customers are leveraging basically renting GPUs from the cloud providers and building their own AI workloads. I do think we're in the very, very early days. They're still learning, experimenting. More-and-more apps are entering production. And as I said on the prepared remarks, we have thousands of workload -- AI workloads running on MongoDB, but a very small percentage of them have demonstrated meaningful product market fit. And so the initial traction is kind of still small. But I think as people get more sophisticated with AI, as the AI technology matures and becomes more and more useful, I think applications will -- you'll start seeing these applications take-off. I kind of chuckled that today I see more senior leaders bragging about the chips they're using versus the apps they're building. So it just tells you that we're still in the very, very early days of this big platform shift. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Great point. Thank you again, guys. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Mike. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Eric Heath of KeyBanc. Your line is open. Eric Heath -- Analyst Hi, thanks for taking the question. Dev, Michael, it sounds like the takeaway from the call is a greater focus on EA and on enterprise. So should we structurally rethink the EA business differently and think of this more as a healthy double-digit growth business going forward for the foreseeable future? And then if I could just ask a follow-up question separate to that. But Michael, I understand that it's still early to identify the fiscal '25 cohort of workloads, but just curious at a high-level if they look and feel like of higher quality than the fiscal '24 cohort of workflow. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Do you want to take on the first one in terms of EA... Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, I mean, I would say, I mean, we are very committed to our run anywhere strategy. And as I said, we are first investing in community where for many customers is the first way they experience MongoDB. And we want them to have the full experience of integrating search and Vector search into our core product. And so they can out of the gate really start building applications. That will then transition to building those capabilities into EA. So, we are clearly investing in the EA product. But Atlas is still a big, big part of our business and a big, big part of our growth engine and we typically launch new features on Atlas and because of the capabilities we already have, the fact it's multi-cloud makes it a very, very compelling offering for many customers. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. And I think in terms of the workloads, I do think it's early. Just as a reminder for folks, they tend to start small, although grow quickly. I think the only other thing that I can add is, we've been pretty consistent and that we've been pleased with the new business that we've done. But we need some time to let the cohorts play out as we track them. But I think like I said, we've been happy with the new business that we were winning. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of William Power of Baird. Your line is open. Brian Raferty Denyeau -- Investor Relations You there, William? William Power -- Analyst Sorry, yeah. Thank you. Dev, you had some encouraging comments on relational migrator. I wonder if you could just touch on what you think is driving the higher interest here. I mean, it sounds like AI is contributing and helping, but it'd be great to get some more color there because that still feels like obviously a meaningful long-term opportunity. And then maybe the second part of the question for Dev or Michael, just be great to get any other framework around the professional services investments. Any way to kind of think about quantification and timing of that? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So the reason we're so excited about the opportunity to go after legacy applications is that, one, it seems like there's a confluence of events happening. One is that the increasing cost and tax of supporting and managing these legacy apps are just going up enough. Second, for many customers who are in regulated industries, the regulators are calling their -- the fact that they're running on these legacy apps with systemic risk, so they can no longer kick the can down the road. Third, also because they no longer can kick the can around, some vendors are going end-of-life, so they have to make a decision to migrate those applications to a more modern tech stack. Fourth, because GenAI is so predicated on data and to build a competitive advantage, you need to leverage your proprietary data, people want to access that data and be able to do so easily. And so that's another reason for them to want to modernize. And then you also have people who built those applications who are retiring or just no longer in the firm, so it just creates more and more risk for the companies. Given all that, customers are incredibly interested in figuring out a way to easily and safely and securely migrate those -- off those applications. And we always could help them very easily move the data and map the schema from a relational schema to a document schema. The hardest part was essentially rewriting the application. Now with the advent of GenAI, you can now significantly reduce the time. One, you can use GenAI to analyze existing code. Two, you can use GenAI to reverse engineer tests to test what the code does. And then three, you can use GenAI to build new code and then users test it to ensure that the new code produces the same results as the old code. And so all that time and effort is suddenly cut in a meaningful way and that's suddenly creating a lot of interest from customers saying, my goodness. And if you're already on a relational app, moving to another relational app doesn't feel like modernization. So, the other advantage is that moving to MongoDB gives them a much more modern platform, a much more agile, flexible, performant, and scalable platform for their future needs. And that's why we're so excited. Again, it's early days. We've run a number of pilots that have gone well. We're in the process of working with some customers now in the migration process. This will take time because these are very, very complex applications. And actually, one thing I also mentioned was that they're not just going after -- saying go after some tertiary Tier 2 or Tier 3 application, they're saying, hey, we want you to look at some of our crown jewels because these are the apps that are most painful for us. So that's also very exciting. But again, this will take time, but we're very committed to this, and we think this is going to drive -- help us drive long-term -- meaningful long-term growth. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, Will. And to the last part of your question on the professional services investment, we're really building out that capacity in order to meet the demand that we're seeing relative to the opportunity. We're calling it in particular because it has a gross margin impact because that's where that will typically show up. And then maybe the last thing and it's probably obvious, but just to sort of underscore it is the reason we're doing this though is for the ARR, right, to drive the new workloads, the additional workloads over to MongoDB as part of that migration. And over time, as we've talked about before, we hope and expect to be able to leverage technology more and more, but at least initially and into the medium-term, there's going to be a healthy human/services component to that. Just wanted to sort of effectively telegraph that out to folks. William Power -- Analyst That's helpful. Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Will. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Rudy Kessinger of DA Davidson. Please go ahead. Rudy Kessinger -- Analyst Hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in here. I believe last quarter you said consumption growth slightly ahead of expectations. And while down slower year-over-year growth versus Q2 last year, the year-over-year growth did improve from Q1. And so, I guess I'm curious for Q3, could you make a comment in that same regard? Obviously, slower on a year-over-year basis than Q3 last year, but was it stable with year-over-year consumption growth in Q2 or better or worse? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Rudy, thanks for the question. We haven't specifically called that out relative to Q2. We did see a lower year-over-year growth as we called out. We did see a seasonal rebound. Usually Q3 is stronger than Q2 and we talked about how that was smaller than in the prior year. So hopefully, that will help you all triangulate. Rudy Kessinger -- Analyst Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. I believe it was on your Q4 call back in March. At that point, Dev, you said it would be at least another year until AI applications are being deployed at scale. It sounds like the commentary that some early large workloads, but out of the thousands, just not many that are at large scale. I guess, is your expectation now that maybe it's still at least another year until we're seeing broad AI application rollouts at scale? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I think a lot of it's a function of the what's happening in the R&D side of AI, right? So for example, today, we don't have a very compelling model designed for our phones, right, because today the phones don't have the computing horsepower to run complex models. So, you don't see a ton of very, very successful consumer apps besides, say, ChatGPT or Claude. So we don't -- we also don't see like hundreds of apps taking off like you saw kind of the first generation of like the Internet or the cloud era, right, or the mobile era. So like I think we're still in the early days of AI. And so while we see a lot of people building AI apps, a lot of them have kind of fairly rudimentary functionality. But I think that over time that's going to change. In fact, I know it will change. I just can't predict when that will happen. But where we do see apps having production, we are having traction, we're seeing them grow very, very quickly and we have a lot of them on our platform. It's just very few of them are really have meaningful. Operator Thank you. And that concludes today's Q&A session. I would like to go ahead and turn the call back over to Dev for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, everyone. I just wanted to say we're really pleased with our Q3 results with strong new business performance and revenue exceeding expectations both -- across both Atlas and EA. We're making the necessary investments to expand our enterprise channel where we see the largest opportunity to establish MongoDB as a standard and the strongest returns on our go-to-market investments. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the progress we're making on both accelerating legacy app modernization with AI as well as establishing ourselves as a standard of the emerging AI tech stack for greenfield AI applications. And last but not least, I would like to thank Michael again for his contributions over the past 10 years and wish him well. Thank you, everyone, and we'll talk to you soon.

operator? question & answers: operator [operator instructions] first question day coming sanjit singh morgan stanley. line open. sanjit singh -- analyst thank taking question congrats, michael, outstanding career. absolutely fantastic run mongodb. excited see next, excited take breather. congrats, michael. guess take question -- start questions, look atlas past two quarters, correct wrong, think consumption coming least modestly ahead expectations. relative seen beginning year, sort -- function sale execution? function end-user activity sort improving? what's driving least improvement atlas consumption past two quarters? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. different things. think look outlook beginning year, indicated thought would see stable atlas growth consumption standpoint. seen talked -- actually seen lower year-over-year growth based underlying consumption. -- that's incorporated q4 guide. seen q3 q4 -- sorry, q2 q3, excuse me, better expectations, still year-over-year basis. want make sure sort confusing comparative set year-over-year versus relative expectations. sanjit singh -- analyst understood. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer core it, sanjit, question really underlying usage applications. sanjit singh -- analyst yeah, make total sense. then, dev, ask ai agent question. term ai agent needing context, going set tool take actions. mean mongodb operational data store customer start roll agentic applications? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. so, talk agents, think think agents, there's jobs, there's -- sorry, there's job, there's project there's task. right now, agent rolled really focused task like say something sierra company rolling agents. right, deemed deal able create rich complex data structures. important ai ai model look isolated data points, need understand relationships, hierarchies, pattern within data. need able essentially get real-time insights. example, chatbot someone querying, customer kind trying get update order placed five minute ago may gotten confirmation, chatbot need able deal real-time information. need able deal basically handling advanced use cases, understanding like, thing like fraud detection understand behavior supply chains, need understand intricate data relationships. thing consistent mongodb offers. believe end day, well-positioned handle this. thing would say embedded natural way search vector search. oltp database, tech search vector search. that's one experience platform offer that, think real advantage. integrated leading ai framework platforms. enterprise-grade security compliance, customer run u anywhere, either 118 cloud region on-prem, huge differentiator us. sanjit singh -- analyst awesome. appreciate thoughts, dev. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, sanjit. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line taylor -- tyler radke citi. line open. tyler radke -- analyst hi, thank much taking question. and, michael, best, congratulation 10 years. going back sale execution, mean, one thing talked earlier year challenge term recently acquired workload ramping. think lot past fiscal year. curious quality workload acquisition trended year. think ramp consumption potential next year, sort look versus time year ago? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. maybe talk change made michael talk little bit consumption trends. so, make change beginning year, really wanted focus volume quality workload slight adjustment made. think change reasonable positive impact. again, early declare victory workload usually start small grow time, really pleased result seeing far. -- again, early days. obviously, know fiscal '25 workload go fiscal '26. far, good. michael, consumption? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, couple things, thanks, tyler. fiscal '24 cohort called earlier, slower growth continue. line revised expectations. made change talked -- earlier year affect fiscal '25 cohorts, early tell. those, need quarter data really see -- seeing behave differently. say talked new business environment success new business. pleased that, show kind initial piece, need see grow cohort evolve. tyler radke -- analyst great. thanks. follow-up ea side, talked outsized strength non-atlas business quarter. maybe could unpack like relative upside driven simply duration versus new business. know called duration impact year-over-year, -- feel like sort one-off feel like maybe bigger customer indexing toward ea impact way think product introducing thing like vector search stream processing onto on-prem product? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah, thank you. overall, continue find ea product resonate customers. important part run anywhere strategy continued see success people wanting increase investment mongodb. there's always multiyear component continue see that. talked beginning year fiscal '24 abnormally high amount multi-year benefit therefore, anticipating headwind quantified roughly $40 million range. talked call earlier saw large accounts, surprising amount multiyear positively benefited q3 little $15 million revenue compared saw q3 year ago. so, much headwind expecting. obviously, 606 dynamics, things, especially large deal kind meaty chunky lumpy, try call sort help people understand, there's pretty healthy kind baseline flow, ea, also multiyear. see spikes, try call you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. want add, tyler, investing call ea business. first, starting investing search vector search community product. couple thing us. one, whenever anyone start mongodb open-source product, immediately get benefit complete highly integrated platform. two, capability migrate ea. so, ea u investment strategy. definitely see lot large customer very, committed running workload on-prem. even see customer want run run ai workload on-prem. so, optionality get using mongodb on-prem cloud, also cross-cloud compelling one. tyler radke -- analyst thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line brad reback stifel. line open. brad reback -- analyst great. thanks much. and, michael, best luck. great run. dev, started call talking bunch investments, great given growth business. obviously, talked reallocating expenses. net-net, think incremental investment phase next year gating margin upside? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer think that's something obviously ready talk next year now, would say -- reason looking invest summarize again, going up-market legacy app modernization see large workload potentially play ideal database genai apps, future important investment drive long-term growth. quite energized investment that's something high conviction on. brad reback -- analyst that's great. maap program, workload going wind atlas healthy combination ea atlas? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer think early days. would say -- would probably say side atlas ea early days. think introduce search vector search ea product, see on-prem. obviously, people use mongodb ai workload using technology well conjunction mongodb on-prem ai use cases. would say probably going see happen first atlas. brad reback -- analyst great. thanks much. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line jason ader william blair. line open. jason ader -- analyst yeah, thank you. going belabor congratulating michael, fun working best luck. question strength ea. think, dev, represents comment enterprise might rethinking reassessing kind on-prem versus cloud workload placement decision? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer well, think large enterprises, think large enterprise meaningful workload still running on-prem. think belief everything would go cloud probably something really popular good old day zurp. think customer assess investment already place, much judicious run workload think leverage existing investment infrastructure, going so. also bunch reason like regulatory reasons, customer quite moving aggressively cloud. see particularly europe, see lot european bank still running majority workload on-prem. also varies region conversely asia, seeing people much move much aggressively cloud. think really depends industry, geography, personal dynamic what's happening particular account. mean, see large u bank also committed running thing on-prem. really varies. that's feel really good run anywhere strategy give customer optionality. build something run on-prem. choose move cloud, easy mongodb. jason ader -- analyst right. follow-up also investment making strategic sale enterprise. could get little specific investment might be? hiring lot new salespeople? working sis, investing sis? additional detail would helpful. thanks. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. everyone's benefit, identified number accounts, call strategic accounts, think high upside us. seen number account grow quickly deploy right mix resources. necessarily quota-carrying resources. could additional technical sale resources, additional p resources, additional customer service resource better service support accounts. even thing like run education session developer accounts, called either hackathons like call developer day even design review meet development team looking build application, help think would potentially use mongodb build particular app. find many developers, experience mongodb quite limited, engage them, educate show simple easy is. like example, customer today think like use oltp database, search database, maybe vector database, like caching database. integrated mongodb. sudden, customer say, wow, simplify life, simplify back-end infrastructure, build app far quickly much easier manage long-term everything mongodb. really function educating power mongodb really open lot opportunity us. that's doubling down, mix resource really predicated accounts, quota counting resources, whole suite resource bringing table. jason ader -- analyst thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line andrew nowinski well fargo. line open. andrew nowinski -- analyst okay. good afternoon. thank much taking question congrats nice quarter. gave example customer migrated postgres think said issue pg vector function. wondering long customer using postgres decided make change mongo, meaning sort like rebound type customer chose pg -- excuse me, postgres work? frequently seeing type transition? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. can't give specific long using postgres, -- trend seeing business. remember postgres 40-year-old technology. -- beneficiary people lifting shifting type relational databases, oracle, sql server, mysql, et cetera. open-source database. part -- open-source relational database, inherent challenge relational database do. quite inflexible. build schema, hard change schema. hard scale hard distribute data. large data volumes, weird thing like, example, resort off-road storage large data objects, creates performance bottlenecks. again, people default postgres know anything better know relational everyone kind moving relational platforms. that's whole point saying earlier. educate developer flexibility schema, easily horizontally scale rich query language aggregation sophisticated geospatial indexes, productivity gain using document model easy organize data, -- people like, wow, life much easier. want clear, zero-sum game. postgres fail u successful. big market quite excited opportunity, see customer moving postgres coming mongodb. andrew nowinski -- analyst thank you. helpful. maybe quick follow-up. normalize $15 million multiyear deal impact q3, would ea still sequentially q4? thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer given level guidance, trying help understand context full-year number headwind talked beginning year, given strength saw q3. andrew nowinski -- analyst got it. thanks. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line raimo lenschow barclays. line open. raimo lenschow -- analyst hey, thank you. think ea strength quarter, michael, kind give u little bit there. like think renewal -- renewal situation renewal pool coming like q3, coming q4, et cetera, well like mean term upsell, cross-sell opportunity people think starting ai project self-serve, kind mentioned earlier call? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. think -- think ea q4, tends large renewal quarter, talking term guide strength multiyear, that's would expect see ea sequentially, typically pattern, called out. term ai workload things, think early tell obviously, continue evolve assess view get full-year guide march. also updated view cohort behaving sort multiyear played out. think term q4, comment made earlier hopefully help. raimo lenschow -- analyst yeah. okay, perfect. -- talk little bit like obviously, there's debate like database persistent layer ai projects, et cetera. see big hyperscalers term working guy partnerships? obviously aws kind summit, et-cetera. speak little bit like relationship big guy evolving around this? michael, best case talk you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. so, start partnership first, like -- aws, said, re:invent show last week. -- remains very, strong. closed ton deal past quarter. very, large deals. integration new product like q bedrock engagement field really strong. azure, think -- shared past, start-off little bit slow start, word person run partner leadership, azure mongodb relationship never stronger. closed large number deals. part what's called azure native ic service program bunch deep integration azure, including fabric, power bi, visual studio, semantic kernel, azure openai studio. also one azure's largest marketplace partners. gcp -- actually seen uptick term co-sales done past quarter gcp made comp change -- favorable working mongodb saw result field, focused closing -- closing handful large deal gcp q4. general, would say, thing going quite well. term of, guess, implying question like hyperscalers potentially bundling thing along ai offerings? mean, candidly, since day one, hyperscalers bundling database offering every offering that's predominant strategy. -- think executed well strategy database like by-the-way decision. important decision. think hyperscalers seeing performance realize better partner us. said, customer understand importance data layer, especially ai applications. partnership across three hyperscalers strong. raimo lenschow -- analyst ok, perfect. thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer thanks, raimo. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line brad sill bank america. line open. brad sill -- analyst great. thank much, congratulations, michael, next move. wanted ask new workload vector search, stream processing, relational migrator. one three that's ramping faster maybe expected? little bit color new workload type ramping. thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. kind give rundown -- mean, essentially asking new products, like -- search, introduced new capability called atlas search nodes, asymmetrically scale search node search-intensive use case, scale node become quite expensive. seen kind groundbreaking capability really well received. demand quite high customer like tune configuration unique need search requirements. one world's largest bank using atlas search provide like google-like search experience payment data massive corporate customers. customer-facing application performance, scalability critical. leading provider ai-powered accounting software us atlas search power invoice analytics future, allows end user finance team perform ad-hoc analysis easily find past-due invoice voice contain errors. search -- vector search, -- again, kind first full-year since going generally available. product uptake actually very, high. q3, released quantization atlas vector search, reduces memory requirement 96%, allowing u support larger vector workload vastly improved price performance. example, multinational news organization created genai powered tool designed help producer journalist efficiently search, summarize, verify information vast varied data sources. leading security firm using atlas vector search fight ai fraud leading global medium company replaced elastic search hybrid search vector search use case user recommendation engine that's built suggest -- that's built suggest article end users. that's super exciting see well. also seeing lot interest streaming product, demand high. rolled another hyperscaler, customer commenting use case able embed stream processing mongodb make life much easier. overall, quite pleased progress making new products. said before, natively bundling capability really reduces eliminates need customer bolt bunch different technology solve problem, saving lot time, money, cost, risk. brad sill -- analyst that's really exciting. thanks, dev. wanted ask question around cedric's appointment. focus may different leadership thinking going forward? thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer no, cedric cro for, gosh, like think like five, six years, -- interim cro three quarter took last made change really expansion responsibilities. known cedric long time. worked multiple different companies. think good barometer understanding sale leadership. there's number sale leader worked top-tier software company used work me. super-excited role cedric going take also making change cedric better align different organization tightly work together going up-market, app monetization positioning well ideal database genai apps. brad sill -- analyst super exciting. thanks, dev. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer thanks, brad. operator thank you. one moment next question, please. next question coming line mike cikos needham company. line open. mike cikos -- analyst hey guys, thanks taking question here. wanted come back consumption growth slightly better expectation second quarter row now. apology missed it, improvement seeing, across vintage geography potentially concentrated scope? trying get better understanding what's seeking place what's embedded guide. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. no, would describe broad-based, mike. obviously, pleased see continuing monitoring slicing dicing different ways. information insight you, share it. without trying throw whole bunch cold water mind, slightly better, step-function changed better, good see. mike cikos -- analyst terrific. maybe quick follow-up dev. think build maybe tyler's question top q&a, cited customer thinking workload holistically even looking run ai workload on-prem. much think function customer still trying figure optimize latency cost demonstration really early phase exploratory phase versus going production? way coarse two necessarily connected? thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer no, think kind little bit both. think customer committed running big part estate on-prem. definition, going build ai workload, run on-prem, mean also need access gpus that. customer leveraging basically renting gpus cloud provider building ai workloads. think very, early days. still learning, experimenting. more-and-more apps entering production. said prepared remarks, thousand workload -- ai workload running mongodb, small percentage demonstrated meaningful product market fit. initial traction kind still small. think people get sophisticated ai, ai technology matures becomes useful, think application -- start seeing application take-off. kind chuckled today see senior leader bragging chip using versus apps building. tell still very, early day big platform shift. mike cikos -- analyst great point. thank again, guys. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, mike. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line eric heath keybanc. line open. eric heath -- analyst hi, thanks taking question. dev, michael, sound like takeaway call greater focus ea enterprise. structurally rethink ea business differently think healthy double-digit growth business going forward foreseeable future? could ask follow-up question separate that. michael, understand still early identify fiscal '25 cohort workloads, curious high-level look feel like higher quality fiscal '24 cohort workflow. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer want take first one term ea... michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, mean, would say, mean, committed run anywhere strategy. said, first investing community many customer first way experience mongodb. want full experience integrating search vector search core product. gate really start building applications. transition building capability ea. so, clearly investing ea product. atlas still big, big part business big, big part growth engine typically launch new feature atlas capability already have, fact multi-cloud make very, compelling offering many customers. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. think term workloads, think early. reminder folks, tend start small, although grow quickly. think thing add is, pretty consistent pleased new business done. need time let cohort play track them. think like said, happy new business winning. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line william power baird. line open. brian raferty denyeau -- investor relation there, william? william power -- analyst sorry, yeah. thank you. dev, encouraging comment relational migrator. wonder could touch think driving higher interest here. mean, sound like ai contributing helping, great get color still feel like obviously meaningful long-term opportunity. maybe second part question dev michael, great get framework around professional service investments. way kind think quantification timing that? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. reason excited opportunity go legacy application that, one, seems like there's confluence event happening. one increasing cost tax supporting managing legacy apps going enough. second, many customer regulated industries, regulator calling -- fact running legacy apps systemic risk, longer kick road. third, also longer kick around, vendor going end-of-life, make decision migrate application modern tech stack. fourth, genai predicated data build competitive advantage, need leverage proprietary data, people want access data able easily. that's another reason want modernize. also people built application retiring longer firm, creates risk companies. given that, customer incredibly interested figuring way easily safely securely migrate -- applications. always could help easily move data map schema relational schema document schema. hardest part essentially rewriting application. advent genai, significantly reduce time. one, use genai analyze existing code. two, use genai reverse engineer test test code does. three, use genai build new code user test ensure new code produce result old code. time effort suddenly cut meaningful way that's suddenly creating lot interest customer saying, goodness. already relational app, moving another relational app feel like modernization. so, advantage moving mongodb give much modern platform, much agile, flexible, performant, scalable platform future needs. that's excited. again, early days. run number pilot gone well. process working customer migration process. take time very, complex applications. actually, one thing also mentioned going -- saying go tertiary tier 2 tier 3 application, saying, hey, want look crown jewel apps painful us. that's also exciting. again, take time, committed this, think going drive -- help u drive long-term -- meaningful long-term growth. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, will. last part question professional service investment, really building capacity order meet demand seeing relative opportunity. calling particular gross margin impact that's typically show up. maybe last thing probably obvious, sort underscore reason though arr, right, drive new workloads, additional workload mongodb part migration. time, talked before, hope expect able leverage technology more, least initially medium-term, there's going healthy human/services component that. wanted sort effectively telegraph folks. william power -- analyst that's helpful. thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, will. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line rudy kessinger da davidson. please go ahead. rudy kessinger -- analyst hey guys, thanks squeezing here. believe last quarter said consumption growth slightly ahead expectations. slower year-over-year growth versus q2 last year, year-over-year growth improve q1. so, guess curious q3, could make comment regard? obviously, slower year-over-year basis q3 last year, stable year-over-year consumption growth q2 better worse? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. rudy, thanks question. specifically called relative q2. see lower year-over-year growth called out. see seasonal rebound. usually q3 stronger q2 talked smaller prior year. hopefully, help triangulate. rudy kessinger -- analyst okay. quick follow-up. believe q4 call back march. point, dev, said would least another year ai application deployed scale. sound like commentary early large workloads, thousands, many large scale. guess, expectation maybe still least another year seeing broad ai application rollouts scale? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. think lot function what's happening r&d side ai, right? example, today, compelling model designed phones, right, today phone computing horsepower run complex models. so, see ton very, successful consumer apps besides, say, chatgpt claude. -- also see like hundred apps taking like saw kind first generation like internet cloud era, right, mobile era. like think still early day ai. see lot people building ai apps, lot kind fairly rudimentary functionality. think time that's going change. fact, know change. can't predict happen. see apps production, traction, seeing grow very, quickly lot platform. really meaningful. operator thank you. concludes today's q&a session. would like go ahead turn call back dev closing remarks. please go ahead. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief

Welcome to the MongoDB third-quarter fiscal year 2025 conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there'll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your speaker for today, Brian Denyeau. Please go ahead. Brian Raferty Denyeau -- Investor Relations Thank you, Lisa. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today to review MongoDB's third-quarter fiscal 2025 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued after the close of the market today. Joining me the call today are Dev Ittycheria, president and CEO of MongoDB; and Michael Gordon, MongoDB's COO and CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our market and future growth opportunities, our expectations for the macroeconomic environment in fiscal 2025 and the impact of AI, the benefits of our product platform, our competitive landscape, customer behaviors, our financial guidance, and our planned investments in growth opportunities in AI. These statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including the results of operations and financial condition that cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. For a discussion of the material risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please refer to the risks described in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 31st, 2024 that we filed with the SEC on August 30th, 2024. Any forward-looking statements made on this call reflect our views only as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them except as required by law. Additionally, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures on this conference call. Please refer to the tables in our earnings release in the Investor Relations portion of our website for a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dev. Dev? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we had a strong quarter of new business and executed well against our large market opportunity. Let's begin by reviewing our third quarter results before giving you a broader company update. We generated revenue of $529 million, a 22% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew 26% year-over-year, representing 68% of total revenue. We generated non-GAAP operating income of $101 million for a 19% non-GAAP operating margin and we ended the quarter with over 52,600 customers. Overall, we were pleased with our performance in the third quarter. We had a strong new business quarter and we're happy with our new workload acquisition on Atlas. Our non-Atlas business significantly exceeded expectations in part because we benefited from a few large multi-year deals as customers continue to value our run anywhere strategy and want to build a deeper longer-term relationship with MongoDB. Atlas consumption was slightly better than expected in a macro-environment that we would characterize as largely consistent with what we saw in the first half of the year. Michael will cover consumption trends in more detail. Retention rates remained strong in Q3, demonstrating the mission criticality of our platform. On our Q1 earnings call, we shared with you the three major strategic initiatives that we believe will enable us to maximize our long-term opportunity. I want to give you an update on the progress we're making on those initiatives. First, we are increasing our investment in the enterprise channel since we see the strongest returns in this part of the market. Specifically, we're expanding our strategic account program going to next year, as we see more accounts that will benefit from incremental investment. In addition, we're investing time and resources to educate developers in large enterprise accounts and uplevel their MongoDB skills. These organizations have thousands of developers and as we penetrate them more deeply, we encounter developers who have historically only built SQL applications and simply do not know how to use MongoDB to its full potential. In our experience, educating these developers on the benefits of MongoDB drives significant incremental adoption of our platform. To fund these up-market investments, we are reallocating a portion of our mid-market investments. The mid-market remains an attractive opportunity for us, but we believe that prioritizing investment up-market will deliver strong returns in the current environment. We also believe there are additional ways to serve the mid-market more efficiently through our self-serve channel and other scaled technology-enabled sales and customer service motions. Second, we are optimistic about the opportunity to accelerate legacy app modernization using AI and are investing more in this area. As you recall, we ran a few successful pilots earlier this year, demonstrating that AI tooling combined with professional services and our relational migrator product can significantly reduce the time, cost, and risk of migrating legacy applications onto MongoDB. While it's early days, we have observed a more than 50% reduction in the cost to modernize. On the back of these strong early results, additional customer interest is exceeding our expectations. Large enterprises in every industry and geography are experiencing acute pain from their legacy infrastructure and are eager for more agile, performant, and cost-effective solutions. Not only are customers excited to engage with us, they also want to focus on some of the most important applications in their enterprise, further demonstrating the level of interest and size of the long-term opportunity. As relational applications encompass a wide variety of database types, programming languages, versions, and other customer-specific variables, we expect modernization projects to continue to include meaningful service engagements in the short and medium term. Consequently, we're increasing our professional services delivery capabilities, both directly and through partners. In the long run, we expect to automate and simplify large parts of the modernization process. To that end, we are leveraging the learnings from early service engagement to develop new tools to accelerate future modernization efforts. Although it's early days and scaling our legacy app modernization capabilities will take time, we have increased conviction that this motion will significantly add to our growth in the long term. Third, we are investing to capitalize on our inherent technical advantages as a key component of the emerging AI tech stack. As a reminder, MongoDB is uniquely equipped to query rich and complex data structures typical of AI applications. The ability of a database to query rich and complex data structures is crucial because AI applications often rely on highly detailed, interrelated, and nuanced data to make accurate predictions and decisions. For example, a recommendation system doesn't just analyze a single customer's purchase but also considers their browsing history, peer group behavior, and product categories requiring a database that can query and interlink these complex data structures. In addition, MongoDB's architecture unifies source data, metadata, operational data, and vector data in an all-in-one platform, updating the need for multiple database systems and complex back-end architectures. This enables a more compelling developer experience than any other alternative. From what we see in the AI market today, most customers are still in the experimental stage as they work to understand the effectiveness of the underlying tech stack and build early proof-of-concept applications. However, we are seeing an increasing number of AI apps in production. Today, we have thousands of AI apps on our platform. What we don't yet see is many of these apps actually achieving meaningful product market fit and therefore significant traction. In fact, as you take a step back and look at the entire universe of AI apps, a very small percentage of them have achieved the type of scale that we commonly see with enterprise-specific applications. We do have some AI apps that are growing quickly, including one that is already a seven-figure workload that has grown 10 times since the beginning of the year. Similar to prior platform shifts as the usefulness of AI tech improves and becomes more cost-effective, we will see the emergence of many more AI apps that do nail product market fit, but it's difficult to predict when that will happen more broadly. We remain confident that we will capture our fair share of these successful AI applications as we see that our platform is popular with developers building more sophisticated AI use cases. We continue investing in our product capabilities, including enterprise-grade Atlas Vector Search functionality to build on this momentum and even better position MongoDB to capture the AI opportunity. In addition, as previously announced, we are bringing search and vector service to our community and EA offerings, leveraging our run anywhere competitive advantage in the world of AI. Finally, we are expanding our MongoDB AI applications program or MAAP, which helps enterprise customers build and bring AI applications into production by providing them with reference architectures, integrations with leading tech providers, and coordinated services and support. Last week, we announced a new code of partners including McKinsey, Confluent, Capgemini, and Unstructured, as well as the collaboration with Meta to enable developers to build AI-enriched applications on MongoDB using Llama. Next, I'd like to provide you with a brief product update. At our dot local developer conference in London in October, we announced the general availability of MongoDB 8.0, the fastest and most performant version of MongoDB ever. MongoDB 8.0 performs 20% to 60% better against common industry benchmarks compared to our prior version and is built to exceed our customers' most stringent security, resiliency, availability, and performance requirements. To best serve our customers, we regularly review and reprioritize investments in our product portfolio to ensure we're allocating our resources to products with the highest demand from our customers. And to do that, we also deprecate products that are not showing results we desired. Consequently, we made the decision to consolidate our Atlas serverless offerings with our smallest dedicated tiers to create Atlas Flex customers, a new offering with a simpler architecture that provides the elasticity features akin to serverless. We will begin migrating effective customers to the single, simple, entry-level solution in Q4. We also decided to deprecate Atlas DeviceSync and other capabilities not widely adopted in order to focus our engineering resources on the core platform. While these reprioritization decisions are not made lightly, they allow us to deliver the most value to the largest number of customers, reinforcing our commitment to being the best modern database and helping us to grow faster. Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the adoption trends of MongoDB across our customer base. Customers across industries and around the world are running mission-critical projects in MongoDB Atlas, leveraging the full power of our developer data platform, including Financial Times, CarGurus, and Victoria's Secret. As part of the digital transformation journey, global specialty retailer Victoria's Secret & Company migrated its e-commerce platform to MongoDB Atlas. As a fully managed platform, MongoDB Atlas allowed the company to simplify its architecture and improve performance, supporting the retailer to provide a resilient, secure, and fast web and mobile e-commerce experience for their millions of customers around the world. Allianz, Alphamad, Swiss Post, and Paylocity are turning to MongoDB to modernize applications. Paylocity, a leading provider of cloud-based payroll and human capital management software, selected MongoDB to power proprietary application aimed at fostering employee connections and engagement. When traffic increased and the original SQL-based solution was unable to keep up with the required performance metrics, Paylocity migrated to MongoDB Atlas to take advantage of the flexible schema architecture, performance, and scalability. MongoDB costs five times less than the previous SQL database solution and the company's developers can now create an application within minutes, something that used to take weeks. Mature companies and start-ups alike are using MongoDB to help deliver the next wave of AI-powered application to customers, including NerdWallet, Cisco, and Tealbook. Tealbook, a supplier intelligence platform, migrated from Postgres, pgvector, and ElasticSearch to MongoDB to eliminate technical debt and consolidate their tech stack. The company experienced workload isolation and scalability issues in pgvector and were concerned with the search index inconsistencies, which were all resolved with the migration to MongoDB. With Atlas Vector search and dedicated search nodes, Tealbook has realized improved cost-efficiency and increased scalability for the supplier data platform, an application that uses GenAI to collect, verify, and enrich supplier data across various sources. In summary, we had a healthy Q3 with both Atlas and EA exceeding expectations. We saw a strong new business quarter and we remain confident in our ability to become an increasing strategic provider in our large and growing market. Looking forward, we see a great opportunity to grow our adoption in the enterprise through new workloads, modernizing legacy applications, and winning the next generation of AI-powered applications. I would like to finish by providing an update on our senior leadership. First, as we announced early in the press release, after nearly 10 years, Michael Gordon has made the decision to leave MongoDB. Michael has been instrumental in MongoDB's success over the past decade, leading our successful IPO, helping us grow our revenue nearly 50-fold, and scaling -- and successfully scaling our business model to generate meaningful operating leverage. He has been a trusted advisor and business partner to the Board and me over the years and also has become a personal friend. Michael is excited to take a well-deserved break. We have commenced the search for Michael's replacement and will be evaluating both internal and external candidates. One of Michael's proudest compliments -- accomplishments has been building a world-class finance team under his leadership, and I'm confident that we will not miss a beat during this transition. Michael will continue to serve as CFO through January 31st to help us finish the fiscal year and then will transition to an Advisor to the company to ensure a seamless process. If we have not named Michael's successor by fiscal year-end, Serge Tanjga, SVP of Finance, will serve as Interim CFO, beginning on February 1st. Second, we are promoting Cedric Pech, currently our chief revenue officer to the newly created role of president worldwide field operations. In this new position, Cedric will oversee all our field-based customer-facing and go-to-market enablement teams, including professional services. We believe this org structure will best enable us to execute on some of the key strategic initiatives I discussed earlier, in particular, our increased focus on up-market and the app monetization opportunity. I would like to congratulate Cedric on this well-deserved promotion. With that, let me turn the call over to Michael. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Dev, and thanks for the kind words and our incredible partnership over the past decade. The past 10 years have been the most rewarding in my professional career and I'm extremely proud of what we've achieved together and of course, to the whole MongoDB team. With as much success as we had, I still believe that MongoDB is in the early stages of realizing its full potential as it continues to take share in one of the largest markets in software. Now, turning to the results for the quarter. I'll begin with a detailed review of our third-quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025. First, I'll start with our third quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $529.4 million, up 22% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance. Shifting to our product mix, Atlas grew 26% in the quarter compared to the previous year and now represents 68% of total revenue compared to 66% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and 71% last quarter. We recognized Atlas revenue primarily based on customer consumption of our platform and that consumption is closely tied to end user activity of their applications. Let me provide some context on Atlas consumption in the quarter. In Q3, consumption was slightly ahead of our expectations. This year's Q3 seasonal improvement was more muted than in years past as expected. On a year-over-year basis, consumption growth remains below that of prior year period. Turning to non-Atlas revenue. Non-Atlas came in significantly ahead of our expectations. As Dev mentioned, EA new business was strong, and we continue to have success selling incremental workloads into our existing customer base. In addition, our Q3 non-Atlas revenue benefited from a few large multi-year deals. As you know, due to ASC 606, we recognized the entire term license component of a multi-year contract at the start of that contract. Compared to Q3 of last year, the multi-year license component of non-Atlas revenues was over $15 million higher. Turning to customer growth. During the third quarter, we grew our customer base by approximately 1,900 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 52,600, which is up from over 46,400 in the year-ago period. Of our total customer count, over 7,400 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 6,900 in the year-ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven primarily by Atlas, which had over 51,100 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 44,900 in the year-ago period. It is important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers adding their first Atlas workload. Continuing on, in Q3, our net ARR expansion rate was approximately 120%. We ended the quarter with 2,314 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, up from $1,972 in the year-ago period. Moving down the income statement, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the third quarter was $405.7 million, representing a gross margin of 77%, which is flat versus the year-ago period. Our income from operations was $101.5 million or 19% operating margin for the third quarter compared to an 18% operating margin in the year-ago period. The primary reason for more favorable operating income results versus guidance is our revenue outperformance, including the very high margin multi-year license revenue benefit. Net income in the third quarter was $98.1 million or $1.16 per share, based on 84.2 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a net income of $79.1 million or $0.96 per share on 83.7 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding in the year-ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the third quarter with $2.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $37.4 million. After taking into consideration approximately $2.9 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was $34.6 million in the quarter. This compares to free cash flow of $35 million in the year-ago period. In Q3, we did not incur capital expenditures to purchase IPV4 addresses as we previously expected, but we did start making those purchases in November and still expect a total outlay of $20 million to $25 million this fiscal year as we previously communicated. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $515 million to $519 million. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $55 million to $58 million and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.65 based on 84.9 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. For the full-fiscal year 2025, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.973 billion to $1.977 billion, non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $242 million to $245 million, and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $3.01 to $3.03 based on 84 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. Note that the non-GAAP net income per share guidance for the fourth-quarter and full-fiscal year 2025 includes a non-GAAP tax provision of approximately 20%. I'll now provide some more context around our updated guidance. First, in terms of Atlas consumption, we expect to see a typical seasonal slowdown in Q4, driven by underlying application usage moderating during the holiday season. Second, since Atlas consumption remained lower on a year-over-year basis in Q3, we expect to see continued deceleration of Atlas year-over-year growth in Q4. Third, we expect to see a sequential decline in non-Atlas revenue in Q4, which is contrary to our normal pattern. The reason for this is that we experienced a significant additional benefit from multi-year deals in Q3, which we do not expect to recur in Q4. In addition, I want to provide some incremental color on some of our recent product and -- how some of our recent product and go-to-market changes will impact the growth of our reported customer count going forward. First, as Dev explained, we are reallocating a portion of our go-to-market resources from the mid-market to the enterprise channel. As a result, we expect to see significantly fewer mid-market direct sales customer net additions and as a result, slower direct sales customer growth going forward. We believe this reallocation of investment dollars will drive higher revenue growth over time. So, it's a trade-off that makes sense. Second, as we introduce Atlas Flex clusters in Q4 and automatically migrate customers in Q1, we expect to see a one-time negative impact to our customer count since we have approximately 4,000 serverless customers who are very low spending and we do not expect them to transition over to Flex. These customers have a negligible impact on our revenue but will impact our reported customer count. To summarize, we're pleased with our third quarter results and especially our ability to win new business. We have a small share in one of the largest and fastest-growing markets in all of software with a number of secular tailwinds, including AI at our back. We'll continue investing judiciously and focusing on our execution to capture this long-term opportunity. With that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator? Questions & Answers: Operator [Operator instructions] Our first question for the day will be coming from Sanjit Singh of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Thank you for taking the questions and congrats, Michael, on outstanding career. You had an absolutely fantastic run at MongoDB. I'm excited to see what you do next, or excited if you just take a breather. So congrats, Michael. I guess to take the question -- to start off with the questions, when we look at what Atlas has been doing in the past two quarters, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think consumption is coming in at least modestly ahead of your expectations. Relative to what we've seen at the beginning of the year, what sort of -- is it a function of sales execution? Is it a function of the end-user activity sort of improving? What's driving at least the improvement in Atlas consumption in the past two quarters? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So a few different things. So I think if you look at our outlook at the beginning of the year, we had indicated that we thought we would see stable Atlas growth from a consumption standpoint. What we've seen and what we've talked about is -- we've actually seen lower year-over-year growth based on the underlying consumption. And so -- and that's incorporated into our Q4 guide. We have seen the Q3 and Q4 be -- sorry, Q2 and Q3, excuse me, be better than our expectations, but it's still down on a year-over-year basis. And so I want to make sure that we're not sort of confusing the comparative set of year-over-year versus relative to our expectations. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Understood. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer And the core of it, Sanjit, to your question is really the underlying usage of the applications. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Yeah, that makes total sense. And then, Dev, I have to ask you the AI agent question. In terms of an AI agent needing more context, it has going to have a set of tools to take its actions. What does it mean for MongoDB as an operational data store as customers start to roll out more agentic applications? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, just to talk about agents, I think when you think about agents, there's jobs, there's -- sorry, there's a job, there's projects and then there's task. Right now, the agents that are being rolled out are really focused on task like say something from Sierra or some other companies are rolling out agents. But you're right, what they deemed to do is to deal with being able to create a rich and complex data structures. Now why is this important for AI is that AI models don't just look at isolated data points, but they need to understand relationships, hierarchies, and patterns within the data. They need to be able to essentially get real-time insights. For example, if you have a chatbot where someone is querying, a customer is kind of trying to get some update on the order they placed five minutes ago because they may have not gotten any confirmation, your chatbot needs to be able to deal with real-time information. You need to be able to deal with basically handling very advanced use cases, understanding like, to do things like fraud detection to understand behaviors of supply chains, you need to understand intricate data relationships. All these things are consistent with MongoDB offers. And so we believe that at the end of the day, we are well-positioned to handle this. And the other thing that I would say is that we've embedded in a very natural way of search and vector search. So we're just not an OLTP database, we do tech search and vector search. That's all one experience and no other platform offers that, and we think we have a real advantage. And so we're integrated with the leading AI frameworks and platforms. We have enterprise-grade security and compliance, and customers can run us anywhere, either on 118 cloud regions or on-prem, and that again is a huge differentiator for us. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Awesome. Appreciate the thoughts, Dev. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Sanjit. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Taylor -- Tyler Radke of Citi. Your line is open. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Hi, thank you very much for taking the question. And, Michael, all the best, and congratulations on 10 years. Going back to the sales execution, I mean, one of the things that you talked about earlier this year was some challenges just in terms of the recently acquired workloads ramping. And I think a lot of those were from the past fiscal year. So curious how the quality of workload acquisition has trended this year. And as you think about the ramp in consumption potential into next year, how does that sort of look versus this time a year ago? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Maybe I'll just talk about what we're doing and the changes we made and then Michael can talk a little bit about the consumption trends. So, we did make some changes at the beginning of the year, and we really wanted to focus on both the volume and the quality of the workloads and there were some slight adjustments that we made. We think those changes are having a reasonable positive impact. Again, it's too early to declare victory because these workloads usually start small and grow over time, but we're really pleased with the results we're seeing so far. And -- but again, it's early days. And obviously, we'll know about the fiscal '25 workloads as we go into fiscal '26. But so far, so good. Michael, on consumption? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, just a couple of things, and thanks, Tyler. The fiscal '24 cohorts that we called out earlier, that slower growth does continue. They've been in line with our revised expectations. We made some changes that we talked about at the -- earlier in the year that should affect the fiscal '25 cohorts, but it's just too early to tell. On those, we need a few more quarters of data before you can really see if we're -- how we're seeing those behave differently. I will say we've talked about the new business environment and our success in new business. We have been pleased with that, but that just shows kind of the initial piece, and we need to see how they grow and how those cohorts evolve. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Great. Thanks. And follow-up on the EA side, you talked about the outsized strength in non-Atlas business this quarter. Maybe if you could unpack like the relative upside that was driven by simply duration versus new business. I know you called out the duration impact year-over-year, but are -- do you feel like this was sort of a one-off or do you feel like maybe some of your bigger customers are indexing more toward EA and how does that impact the way you think about the product and introducing things like vector search and stream processing onto the on-prem product? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, thank you. So overall, we continue to find the EA product resonate with customers. It's an important part of the run anywhere strategy and we've continued to see success with that and people wanting to increase their investment in MongoDB. There's always been a multiyear component and we continue to see that. We talked about that at the beginning of the year as to how fiscal '24 had an abnormally high amount of multi-year benefit and therefore, we were anticipating that being a headwind and we quantified that in roughly the $40 million range. What we talked about on this call earlier is we saw from a few large accounts, a surprising amount of multiyear that positively benefited Q3 at a little more than $15 million in revenue compared to what we saw Q3 a year ago. So, not as much of a headwind as we had been expecting. Obviously, with the 606 dynamics, some of these things, especially for a large deal can be kind of meaty and chunky and lumpy, which is why we try and call it out and sort of help people understand, but there's a pretty healthy kind of baseline flow, not just of EA, but also of multiyear. And when we see spikes, we just try and call it out for you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I just want to add, Tyler, that we are investing in our what we call our EA business. First, we're starting by investing with search and vector search and a community product. That does a couple of things for us. One, whenever anyone starts with MongoDB with the open-source product, they immediately get all the benefits of that complete highly integrated platform. Two, those capabilities will then migrate to EA. So, EA for us is an investment strategy. We definitely see lots of large customers who are very, very committed to running workloads on-prem. We even see some customers want to run to run AI workloads on-prem. So, the optionality they get by using MongoDB to not just be on-prem and the cloud, but also cross-cloud is a very compelling one. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Brad Reback of Stifel. Your line is open. Brad Reback -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. And, Michael, best of luck. It's been a great run. Dev, you started the call talking about a bunch of investments, which are great given the growth of the business. And obviously, you talked about reallocating some expenses. But net-net, should we think about this incremental investment phase next year as gating margin upside? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think that's something that we obviously are not ready to talk about next year just now, but I would say that we -- the reason we're looking to invest and just to summarize again, going up-market on legacy app modernization where we see very large workloads potentially at play and being the ideal database for GenAI apps, which is the future as important investments to drive long-term growth. And we're quite energized by those investments and that's something that we have high conviction on. Brad Reback -- Analyst That's great. And then on the MAAP program, are most of those workloads going to wind up in Atlas or will that be a healthy combination of EA and Atlas? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think it's again early days. I would say -- I would probably say more on the side of Atlas and EA in the early days. I think once we introduce a search and vector search into the EA product, you'll see more of that on-prem. Obviously, people can use MongoDB for AI workloads using other technologies as well in conjunction with MongoDB for on-prem AI use cases. But I would say you're probably going to see that happen first in Atlas. Brad Reback -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Jason Ader of William Blair. Your line is open. Jason Ader -- Analyst Yeah, thank you. I'm not going to belabor congratulating Michael, but it has been it has been fun working with you and best of luck. The question I had is on the strength in EA. Do you think, Dev, it represents a comment on how enterprises might be rethinking or reassessing the kind of on-prem versus cloud workload placement decision? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Well, when I think about large enterprises, I think large enterprises have meaningful workloads that are still running on-prem. I think the belief that everything would go to the cloud was probably something that was really popular in the good old days of Zurp. But I think now as customers assess their investments that they already have in place, they're being much more judicious about where they run those workloads and if they think they can leverage their existing investments in their own infrastructure, then they're going to do so. Also for a bunch of other reasons like regulatory reasons, some customers are quite not moving as aggressively to the cloud. We see that in particularly in Europe, where we see a lot of the European banks still running majority of the workloads on-prem. So it also varies by region where conversely in Asia, we're seeing people much move much more aggressively to the cloud. So I think it really depends on industry, on geography, and on the personal dynamics of what's happening in that particular account. I mean, we see some large US banks are also very committed to running things on-prem. So it really varies. And that's why we feel really good about our run anywhere strategy because it gives customer optionality. They can build something and run on-prem. And if and when they choose to move to the cloud, it's very easy to do so with MongoDB. Jason Ader -- Analyst All right. And then just as a follow-up also on the investments you're making in strategic sales and enterprise. Could you just get a little more specific on what those investments might be? Is it hiring a lot of new salespeople? Is it working more with SIs, investing more in SIs? Any additional detail would be helpful. Thanks. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So just for everyone's benefit, we've identified a number of accounts, which we call strategic accounts, which we think that have high upside for us. We've seen a number of accounts that grow very quickly when we deploy the right mix of resources. Now they're all not necessarily quota-carrying resources. They could be additional technical sales resources, additional PS resources, additional customer service resources to better service and support those accounts. We even do things like run education sessions for developers of the accounts, they're called either hackathons or like what we call developer days or even design reviews where we'll meet with our development teams who are looking to build an application, help them think about how they would potentially use MongoDB to build that particular app. And what we find is that because many of these developers, the experience with MongoDB is quite limited, the more we can engage with them, the more we can educate them and the more we can show them how simple and easy it is. Like for example, most customers today think like they have to use an OLTP database, then a search database, maybe a vector database, and then like a caching database. And all that is integrated in MongoDB. So all of a sudden, customers can say, wow, I can simplify my life, simplify my back-end infrastructure, build this app far more quickly and it will be much more easier to manage long-term if I do everything on MongoDB. And it's really a function of just educating them on the power of MongoDB that really opens up a lot of opportunities for us. So that's why we're doubling down, and the mix of resources is really predicated on the accounts, but it's not just quota counting resources, it's the whole suite of resources that we're bringing to the table. Jason Ader -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Andrew Nowinski of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Okay. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking the question and congrats on a nice quarter. You gave an example of a customer that migrated off Postgres and I think you said they had issues with their PG vector function. I was wondering how long was that customer using Postgres before they decided to make a change to Mongo, meaning was this some sort of like a rebound type customer where they chose PG -- or excuse me, Postgres and it didn't work? And then how frequently are you seeing this type of transition? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So I can't give you the specifics on how long they were using Postgres, but this is not -- this is a trend that we're seeing in our business. You have to remember Postgres is a 40-year-old technology. It's -- and they have been the beneficiary of people lifting and shifting from other types of relational databases, Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, et cetera. And they're an open-source database. And but as part -- because they're an open-source and relational database, they have the same inherent challenges all relational databases do. They're quite inflexible. So once you build a schema, it's very hard to change the schema. It's hard to scale and hard to distribute data. And if you have large data volumes, you have to do weird things like, for example, resort to off-road storage for large data objects, which creates performance bottlenecks. And so again, people default to Postgres if they don't know anything better because all they know is relational and everyone is kind of moving off those other relational platforms. And that's the whole point I was saying earlier. Once we educate developers on the flexibility of schema, how easily or horizontally scale the rich query language where you can do aggregations and do sophisticated geospatial indexes, the productivity gains by using the document model and how easy is to organize data, it's -- people are just like, wow, life is so much easier. Now I want to be clear, this is not a zero-sum game. Postgres does not have to fail for us to be successful. It's a big market and we're quite excited about the opportunity, but we do see customers moving off Postgres and coming to MongoDB. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Thank you. That was very helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up. If we normalize the $15 million multiyear deal impact you had in Q3, would EA still be down sequentially in Q4? Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer We haven't given that level of guidance, but just trying to help you understand in the context of the full-year numbers and the headwind that we talked about at the beginning of the year, just given the strength that we saw in Q3. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Got it. Thanks. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. The next question will be coming from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst Hey, thank you. And if you think about the EA strength this quarter, Michael, you'd kind of give us a little bit there. Like how should we think about renewal -- the renewal situation renewal pool coming up like or that you had in Q3, coming up in Q4, et cetera, as well and then like what does it mean in terms of upsell, cross-sell opportunity as people think about starting AI projects by self-serve, as you kind of mentioned earlier on the call? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So I think about -- if you think about EA for Q4, it tends to be a large renewal quarter, but what we're talking about in terms of the guide is because we had such strength in multiyear, that's where we would expect to see our EA down sequentially, which is not typically our pattern, which is why we called it out. In terms of AI workloads and some of those other things, I think it's early to tell and obviously, we'll continue to evolve and assess our view when we get to the full-year guide in March. And then we'll also have an updated view on how the cohorts are behaving and sort of how multiyear played out. But I think in terms of Q4, the comments that I made earlier hopefully will help. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst Yeah. Okay, perfect. And then the -- and can you talk a little bit about like obviously, there's a debate of like which database will be the persistent layer if you do AI projects, et cetera. What do you see from the big hyperscalers in terms of working with you guys and partnerships? We obviously just have AWS kind of summit, et-cetera. Can you speak a little bit like how your relationship with those big guys is evolving around this? And Michael, All the best in case I don't talk to you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, I'll start with the partnerships first, like our -- with AWS, as you said, they just had their re:Invent show last week. Our -- it remains very, very strong. We've closed a ton of deals this past quarter. Some of them very, very large deals. We're doing integrations to some of the new products like Q and Bedrock and the engagement in the field has been really strong. On Azure, I think we -- as I've shared in the past, we start-off with a little bit of a slow start, but in the words of the person who runs their partner leadership, the Azure MongoDB relationship has never been stronger. We've closed a large number of deals. We're part of what's called the Azure native IC service program and have a bunch of deep integrations with Azure, including Fabric, Power BI, Visual Studio, Semantic Kernel, and Azure OpenAI Studio. And we're also one of Azure's largest marketplace partners. And GCP does -- we have actually seen some uptick in terms of co-sales that we've done this past quarter and GCP made some comp changes where they -- that were favorable to working with MongoDB that we saw some results in the field, and we're focused on closing on -- closing a handful of large deals with GCP in Q4. So in general, I would say, things are going quite well. And then in terms of, I guess, implying your question was like the hyperscalers and are they potentially bundling things along with their AI offerings? I mean, candidly, since day one, the hyperscalers have been bundling their database offerings with every offering that they have and that's been their predominant strategy. And we've -- I think we've executed well against strategy because databases are not like a by-the-way decision. It's an important decision. And I think the hyperscalers are seeing our performance and realize it's better to partner with us. And as I said, customers understand the importance of the data layer, especially for AI applications. And so the partnership across all three hyperscalers is strong. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst OK, perfect. Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Raimo. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. The next question will be coming from the line of Brad Sills of Bank of America. Your line is open. Brad Sills -- Analyst Great. Thank you so much, and congratulations, Michael, on your next move. I wanted to ask about new workloads here on vector search, stream processing, relational migrator. Is there any one of those three that's ramping faster than maybe you expected? Just a little bit of color on how those new workload types are ramping. Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I'll kind of give you just a rundown of some of the -- I mean, essentially you're asking about the new products, like our -- on search, we introduced a new capability called Atlas search nodes, which where you can asymmetrically scale your search nodes because if you have a search-intensive use case, you don't have to scale all your nodes because they have become quite expensive. And we've seen that this kind of groundbreaking capability really well received. The demand is quite high and because customers like they can tune the configuration to the unique needs of their search requirements. One of the world's largest banks is using Atlas Search to provide like a Google-like search experience on payments data for massive corporate customers. So this is a customer-facing application and so performance, and scalability are critical. A leading provider of AI-powered accounting software uses Atlas Search to power its invoice analytics future, which allows end users and finance teams to perform ad-hoc analysis and easily find past-due invoices and voices that contain errors. So that search -- on vector search, it -- again, and it's been our kind of our first full-year since going generally available. And the product uptake has been actually very, very high. In Q3, we released quantization for Atlas Vector Search, which reduces the memory requirements by up to 96%, allowing us to support larger vector workloads with vastly improved price performance. For example, a multinational news organization created a GenAI powered tool designed to help producers and journalists efficiently search, summarize, and verify information from vast and varied data sources. A leading security firm is using Atlas Vector Search to fight AI fraud and a leading global media company replaced elastic search with hybrid search and vector search use case for a user recommendation engine that's built to suggest -- that's built in to suggest articles to end users. And so that's super exciting to see as well. We're also seeing a lot of interest in our streaming product, demand is very high. We just rolled it out to another hyperscaler, and customers are commenting on that the use cases of being able to embed stream processing with MongoDB makes our life so much easier. So overall, we're quite pleased with the progress we're making on the new products. And as I said before, natively bundling all these capabilities really reduces or eliminates the need for customers to have to bolt on a bunch of different technologies to solve the same problem, saving them a lot of time, money, cost, and risk. Brad Sills -- Analyst That's really exciting. Thanks, Dev. And then I wanted to ask a question around Cedric's appointment. Any focus that may be different here under his leadership that we should be thinking about going forward? Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer No, Cedric has been our CRO for, gosh, now like I think like five, six years, and he -- I was the Interim CRO for about three quarters until he took over when we last made a change and this is really an expansion of his responsibilities. I've known Cedric for a long time. He and I have worked with at multiple different companies. I think I have a good barometer for understanding sales leadership. There's a number of sales leaders who worked at other top-tier software companies who used to work for me or with me. And so I'm super-excited by the role Cedric is going to take and then we're also making some changes under Cedric to better align the different organizations so that we can more tightly work together on going up-market, on app monetization and positioning ourselves well to be the ideal database for GenAI apps. Brad Sills -- Analyst Super exciting. Thanks, Dev. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Brad. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question, please. Our next question will be coming from the line of Mike Cikos of Needham and Company. Your line is open. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Hey guys, thanks for taking the question here. I just wanted to come back to the consumption growth being slightly better than expectations again for the second quarter in a row now. And apologies if I missed it, but this improvement that we're seeing, is this across all vintages and geographies or is it potentially more concentrated in scope? Just trying to get a better understanding of what's seeking place out there and what's embedded in the guide. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. No, I would describe it as broad-based, Mike. And obviously, we're pleased to see it and we're continuing monitoring and slicing and dicing it in different ways. And as we have information or insights to you, we'll share it. And without trying to throw a whole bunch of cold water on our mind, it was slightly better, or a step-function changed better, but good to see. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Terrific. And maybe for a quick follow-up for Dev. I think it builds off maybe Tyler's question at the top of the Q&A, but you had cited that some customers are thinking about their workloads more holistically and even looking to run AI workloads on-prem. How much of that do you think is just a function of customers are still trying to figure out how to optimize for latency and cost or is this more a demonstration of we really are in the early phases of the exploratory phase versus going into production? Is there any way to coarse that out or is the two not necessarily connected? Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer No, I think it's kind of a little bit of both. I think you have some customers who are very committed to running a big part of the estate on-prem. So by definition, then if they're going to build an AI workload, it has to be run on-prem, which means that they also need access to GPUs and they're doing that. And then other customers are leveraging basically renting GPUs from the cloud providers and building their own AI workloads. I do think we're in the very, very early days. They're still learning, experimenting. More-and-more apps are entering production. And as I said on the prepared remarks, we have thousands of workload -- AI workloads running on MongoDB, but a very small percentage of them have demonstrated meaningful product market fit. And so the initial traction is kind of still small. But I think as people get more sophisticated with AI, as the AI technology matures and becomes more and more useful, I think applications will -- you'll start seeing these applications take-off. I kind of chuckled that today I see more senior leaders bragging about the chips they're using versus the apps they're building. So it just tells you that we're still in the very, very early days of this big platform shift. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Great point. Thank you again, guys. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Mike. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Eric Heath of KeyBanc. Your line is open. Eric Heath -- Analyst Hi, thanks for taking the question. Dev, Michael, it sounds like the takeaway from the call is a greater focus on EA and on enterprise. So should we structurally rethink the EA business differently and think of this more as a healthy double-digit growth business going forward for the foreseeable future? And then if I could just ask a follow-up question separate to that. But Michael, I understand that it's still early to identify the fiscal '25 cohort of workloads, but just curious at a high-level if they look and feel like of higher quality than the fiscal '24 cohort of workflow. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Do you want to take on the first one in terms of EA... Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, I mean, I would say, I mean, we are very committed to our run anywhere strategy. And as I said, we are first investing in community where for many customers is the first way they experience MongoDB. And we want them to have the full experience of integrating search and Vector search into our core product. And so they can out of the gate really start building applications. That will then transition to building those capabilities into EA. So, we are clearly investing in the EA product. But Atlas is still a big, big part of our business and a big, big part of our growth engine and we typically launch new features on Atlas and because of the capabilities we already have, the fact it's multi-cloud makes it a very, very compelling offering for many customers. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. And I think in terms of the workloads, I do think it's early. Just as a reminder for folks, they tend to start small, although grow quickly. I think the only other thing that I can add is, we've been pretty consistent and that we've been pleased with the new business that we've done. But we need some time to let the cohorts play out as we track them. But I think like I said, we've been happy with the new business that we were winning. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of William Power of Baird. Your line is open. Brian Raferty Denyeau -- Investor Relations You there, William? William Power -- Analyst Sorry, yeah. Thank you. Dev, you had some encouraging comments on relational migrator. I wonder if you could just touch on what you think is driving the higher interest here. I mean, it sounds like AI is contributing and helping, but it'd be great to get some more color there because that still feels like obviously a meaningful long-term opportunity. And then maybe the second part of the question for Dev or Michael, just be great to get any other framework around the professional services investments. Any way to kind of think about quantification and timing of that? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So the reason we're so excited about the opportunity to go after legacy applications is that, one, it seems like there's a confluence of events happening. One is that the increasing cost and tax of supporting and managing these legacy apps are just going up enough. Second, for many customers who are in regulated industries, the regulators are calling their -- the fact that they're running on these legacy apps with systemic risk, so they can no longer kick the can down the road. Third, also because they no longer can kick the can around, some vendors are going end-of-life, so they have to make a decision to migrate those applications to a more modern tech stack. Fourth, because GenAI is so predicated on data and to build a competitive advantage, you need to leverage your proprietary data, people want to access that data and be able to do so easily. And so that's another reason for them to want to modernize. And then you also have people who built those applications who are retiring or just no longer in the firm, so it just creates more and more risk for the companies. Given all that, customers are incredibly interested in figuring out a way to easily and safely and securely migrate those -- off those applications. And we always could help them very easily move the data and map the schema from a relational schema to a document schema. The hardest part was essentially rewriting the application. Now with the advent of GenAI, you can now significantly reduce the time. One, you can use GenAI to analyze existing code. Two, you can use GenAI to reverse engineer tests to test what the code does. And then three, you can use GenAI to build new code and then users test it to ensure that the new code produces the same results as the old code. And so all that time and effort is suddenly cut in a meaningful way and that's suddenly creating a lot of interest from customers saying, my goodness. And if you're already on a relational app, moving to another relational app doesn't feel like modernization. So, the other advantage is that moving to MongoDB gives them a much more modern platform, a much more agile, flexible, performant, and scalable platform for their future needs. And that's why we're so excited. Again, it's early days. We've run a number of pilots that have gone well. We're in the process of working with some customers now in the migration process. This will take time because these are very, very complex applications. And actually, one thing I also mentioned was that they're not just going after -- saying go after some tertiary Tier 2 or Tier 3 application, they're saying, hey, we want you to look at some of our crown jewels because these are the apps that are most painful for us. So that's also very exciting. But again, this will take time, but we're very committed to this, and we think this is going to drive -- help us drive long-term -- meaningful long-term growth. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, Will. And to the last part of your question on the professional services investment, we're really building out that capacity in order to meet the demand that we're seeing relative to the opportunity. We're calling it in particular because it has a gross margin impact because that's where that will typically show up. And then maybe the last thing and it's probably obvious, but just to sort of underscore it is the reason we're doing this though is for the ARR, right, to drive the new workloads, the additional workloads over to MongoDB as part of that migration. And over time, as we've talked about before, we hope and expect to be able to leverage technology more and more, but at least initially and into the medium-term, there's going to be a healthy human/services component to that. Just wanted to sort of effectively telegraph that out to folks. William Power -- Analyst That's helpful. Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Will. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Rudy Kessinger of DA Davidson. Please go ahead. Rudy Kessinger -- Analyst Hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in here. I believe last quarter you said consumption growth slightly ahead of expectations. And while down slower year-over-year growth versus Q2 last year, the year-over-year growth did improve from Q1. And so, I guess I'm curious for Q3, could you make a comment in that same regard? Obviously, slower on a year-over-year basis than Q3 last year, but was it stable with year-over-year consumption growth in Q2 or better or worse? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Rudy, thanks for the question. We haven't specifically called that out relative to Q2. We did see a lower year-over-year growth as we called out. We did see a seasonal rebound. Usually Q3 is stronger than Q2 and we talked about how that was smaller than in the prior year. So hopefully, that will help you all triangulate. Rudy Kessinger -- Analyst Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. I believe it was on your Q4 call back in March. At that point, Dev, you said it would be at least another year until AI applications are being deployed at scale. It sounds like the commentary that some early large workloads, but out of the thousands, just not many that are at large scale. I guess, is your expectation now that maybe it's still at least another year until we're seeing broad AI application rollouts at scale? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I think a lot of it's a function of the what's happening in the R&D side of AI, right? So for example, today, we don't have a very compelling model designed for our phones, right, because today the phones don't have the computing horsepower to run complex models. So, you don't see a ton of very, very successful consumer apps besides, say, ChatGPT or Claude. So we don't -- we also don't see like hundreds of apps taking off like you saw kind of the first generation of like the Internet or the cloud era, right, or the mobile era. So like I think we're still in the early days of AI. And so while we see a lot of people building AI apps, a lot of them have kind of fairly rudimentary functionality. But I think that over time that's going to change. In fact, I know it will change. I just can't predict when that will happen. But where we do see apps having production, we are having traction, we're seeing them grow very, very quickly and we have a lot of them on our platform. It's just very few of them are really have meaningful. Operator Thank you. And that concludes today's Q&A session. I would like to go ahead and turn the call back over to Dev for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, everyone. I just wanted to say we're really pleased with our Q3 results with strong new business performance and revenue exceeding expectations both -- across both Atlas and EA. We're making the necessary investments to expand our enterprise channel where we see the largest opportunity to establish MongoDB as a standard and the strongest returns on our go-to-market investments. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the progress we're making on both accelerating legacy app modernization with AI as well as establishing ourselves as a standard of the emerging AI tech stack for greenfield AI applications. And last but not least, I would like to thank Michael again for his contributions over the past 10 years and wish him well. Thank you, everyone, and we'll talk to you soon.

operator? question & answers: operator [operator instructions] first question day coming sanjit singh morgan stanley. line open. sanjit singh -- analyst thank taking question congrats, michael, outstanding career. absolutely fantastic run mongodb. excited see next, excited take breather. congrats, michael. guess take question -- start questions, look atlas past two quarters, correct wrong, think consumption coming least modestly ahead expectations. relative seen beginning year, sort -- function sale execution? function end-user activity sort improving? what's driving least improvement atlas consumption past two quarters? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. different things. think look outlook beginning year, indicated thought would see stable atlas growth consumption standpoint. seen talked -- actually seen lower year-over-year growth based underlying consumption. -- that's incorporated q4 guide. seen q3 q4 -- sorry, q2 q3, excuse me, better expectations, still year-over-year basis. want make sure sort confusing comparative set year-over-year versus relative expectations. sanjit singh -- analyst understood. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer core it, sanjit, question really underlying usage applications. sanjit singh -- analyst yeah, make total sense. then, dev, ask ai agent question. term ai agent needing context, going set tool take actions. mean mongodb operational data store customer start roll agentic applications? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. so, talk agents, think think agents, there's jobs, there's -- sorry, there's job, there's project there's task. right now, agent rolled really focused task like say something sierra company rolling agents. right, deemed deal able create rich complex data structures. important ai ai model look isolated data points, need understand relationships, hierarchies, pattern within data. need able essentially get real-time insights. example, chatbot someone querying, customer kind trying get update order placed five minute ago may gotten confirmation, chatbot need able deal real-time information. need able deal basically handling advanced use cases, understanding like, thing like fraud detection understand behavior supply chains, need understand intricate data relationships. thing consistent mongodb offers. believe end day, well-positioned handle this. thing would say embedded natural way search vector search. oltp database, tech search vector search. that's one experience platform offer that, think real advantage. integrated leading ai framework platforms. enterprise-grade security compliance, customer run u anywhere, either 118 cloud region on-prem, huge differentiator us. sanjit singh -- analyst awesome. appreciate thoughts, dev. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, sanjit. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line taylor -- tyler radke citi. line open. tyler radke -- analyst hi, thank much taking question. and, michael, best, congratulation 10 years. going back sale execution, mean, one thing talked earlier year challenge term recently acquired workload ramping. think lot past fiscal year. curious quality workload acquisition trended year. think ramp consumption potential next year, sort look versus time year ago? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. maybe talk change made michael talk little bit consumption trends. so, make change beginning year, really wanted focus volume quality workload slight adjustment made. think change reasonable positive impact. again, early declare victory workload usually start small grow time, really pleased result seeing far. -- again, early days. obviously, know fiscal '25 workload go fiscal '26. far, good. michael, consumption? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, couple things, thanks, tyler. fiscal '24 cohort called earlier, slower growth continue. line revised expectations. made change talked -- earlier year affect fiscal '25 cohorts, early tell. those, need quarter data really see -- seeing behave differently. say talked new business environment success new business. pleased that, show kind initial piece, need see grow cohort evolve. tyler radke -- analyst great. thanks. follow-up ea side, talked outsized strength non-atlas business quarter. maybe could unpack like relative upside driven simply duration versus new business. know called duration impact year-over-year, -- feel like sort one-off feel like maybe bigger customer indexing toward ea impact way think product introducing thing like vector search stream processing onto on-prem product? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah, thank you. overall, continue find ea product resonate customers. important part run anywhere strategy continued see success people wanting increase investment mongodb. there's always multiyear component continue see that. talked beginning year fiscal '24 abnormally high amount multi-year benefit therefore, anticipating headwind quantified roughly $40 million range. talked call earlier saw large accounts, surprising amount multiyear positively benefited q3 little $15 million revenue compared saw q3 year ago. so, much headwind expecting. obviously, 606 dynamics, things, especially large deal kind meaty chunky lumpy, try call sort help people understand, there's pretty healthy kind baseline flow, ea, also multiyear. see spikes, try call you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. want add, tyler, investing call ea business. first, starting investing search vector search community product. couple thing us. one, whenever anyone start mongodb open-source product, immediately get benefit complete highly integrated platform. two, capability migrate ea. so, ea u investment strategy. definitely see lot large customer very, committed running workload on-prem. even see customer want run run ai workload on-prem. so, optionality get using mongodb on-prem cloud, also cross-cloud compelling one. tyler radke -- analyst thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line brad reback stifel. line open. brad reback -- analyst great. thanks much. and, michael, best luck. great run. dev, started call talking bunch investments, great given growth business. obviously, talked reallocating expenses. net-net, think incremental investment phase next year gating margin upside? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer think that's something obviously ready talk next year now, would say -- reason looking invest summarize again, going up-market legacy app modernization see large workload potentially play ideal database genai apps, future important investment drive long-term growth. quite energized investment that's something high conviction on. brad reback -- analyst that's great. maap program, workload going wind atlas healthy combination ea atlas? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer think early days. would say -- would probably say side atlas ea early days. think introduce search vector search ea product, see on-prem. obviously, people use mongodb ai workload using technology well conjunction mongodb on-prem ai use cases. would say probably going see happen first atlas. brad reback -- analyst great. thanks much. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line jason ader william blair. line open. jason ader -- analyst yeah, thank you. going belabor congratulating michael, fun working best luck. question strength ea. think, dev, represents comment enterprise might rethinking reassessing kind on-prem versus cloud workload placement decision? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer well, think large enterprises, think large enterprise meaningful workload still running on-prem. think belief everything would go cloud probably something really popular good old day zurp. think customer assess investment already place, much judicious run workload think leverage existing investment infrastructure, going so. also bunch reason like regulatory reasons, customer quite moving aggressively cloud. see particularly europe, see lot european bank still running majority workload on-prem. also varies region conversely asia, seeing people much move much aggressively cloud. think really depends industry, geography, personal dynamic what's happening particular account. mean, see large u bank also committed running thing on-prem. really varies. that's feel really good run anywhere strategy give customer optionality. build something run on-prem. choose move cloud, easy mongodb. jason ader -- analyst right. follow-up also investment making strategic sale enterprise. could get little specific investment might be? hiring lot new salespeople? working sis, investing sis? additional detail would helpful. thanks. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. everyone's benefit, identified number accounts, call strategic accounts, think high upside us. seen number account grow quickly deploy right mix resources. necessarily quota-carrying resources. could additional technical sale resources, additional p resources, additional customer service resource better service support accounts. even thing like run education session developer accounts, called either hackathons like call developer day even design review meet development team looking build application, help think would potentially use mongodb build particular app. find many developers, experience mongodb quite limited, engage them, educate show simple easy is. like example, customer today think like use oltp database, search database, maybe vector database, like caching database. integrated mongodb. sudden, customer say, wow, simplify life, simplify back-end infrastructure, build app far quickly much easier manage long-term everything mongodb. really function educating power mongodb really open lot opportunity us. that's doubling down, mix resource really predicated accounts, quota counting resources, whole suite resource bringing table. jason ader -- analyst thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line andrew nowinski well fargo. line open. andrew nowinski -- analyst okay. good afternoon. thank much taking question congrats nice quarter. gave example customer migrated postgres think said issue pg vector function. wondering long customer using postgres decided make change mongo, meaning sort like rebound type customer chose pg -- excuse me, postgres work? frequently seeing type transition? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. can't give specific long using postgres, -- trend seeing business. remember postgres 40-year-old technology. -- beneficiary people lifting shifting type relational databases, oracle, sql server, mysql, et cetera. open-source database. part -- open-source relational database, inherent challenge relational database do. quite inflexible. build schema, hard change schema. hard scale hard distribute data. large data volumes, weird thing like, example, resort off-road storage large data objects, creates performance bottlenecks. again, people default postgres know anything better know relational everyone kind moving relational platforms. that's whole point saying earlier. educate developer flexibility schema, easily horizontally scale rich query language aggregation sophisticated geospatial indexes, productivity gain using document model easy organize data, -- people like, wow, life much easier. want clear, zero-sum game. postgres fail u successful. big market quite excited opportunity, see customer moving postgres coming mongodb. andrew nowinski -- analyst thank you. helpful. maybe quick follow-up. normalize $15 million multiyear deal impact q3, would ea still sequentially q4? thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer given level guidance, trying help understand context full-year number headwind talked beginning year, given strength saw q3. andrew nowinski -- analyst got it. thanks. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line raimo lenschow barclays. line open. raimo lenschow -- analyst hey, thank you. think ea strength quarter, michael, kind give u little bit there. like think renewal -- renewal situation renewal pool coming like q3, coming q4, et cetera, well like mean term upsell, cross-sell opportunity people think starting ai project self-serve, kind mentioned earlier call? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. think -- think ea q4, tends large renewal quarter, talking term guide strength multiyear, that's would expect see ea sequentially, typically pattern, called out. term ai workload things, think early tell obviously, continue evolve assess view get full-year guide march. also updated view cohort behaving sort multiyear played out. think term q4, comment made earlier hopefully help. raimo lenschow -- analyst yeah. okay, perfect. -- talk little bit like obviously, there's debate like database persistent layer ai projects, et cetera. see big hyperscalers term working guy partnerships? obviously aws kind summit, et-cetera. speak little bit like relationship big guy evolving around this? michael, best case talk you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. so, start partnership first, like -- aws, said, re:invent show last week. -- remains very, strong. closed ton deal past quarter. very, large deals. integration new product like q bedrock engagement field really strong. azure, think -- shared past, start-off little bit slow start, word person run partner leadership, azure mongodb relationship never stronger. closed large number deals. part what's called azure native ic service program bunch deep integration azure, including fabric, power bi, visual studio, semantic kernel, azure openai studio. also one azure's largest marketplace partners. gcp -- actually seen uptick term co-sales done past quarter gcp made comp change -- favorable working mongodb saw result field, focused closing -- closing handful large deal gcp q4. general, would say, thing going quite well. term of, guess, implying question like hyperscalers potentially bundling thing along ai offerings? mean, candidly, since day one, hyperscalers bundling database offering every offering that's predominant strategy. -- think executed well strategy database like by-the-way decision. important decision. think hyperscalers seeing performance realize better partner us. said, customer understand importance data layer, especially ai applications. partnership across three hyperscalers strong. raimo lenschow -- analyst ok, perfect. thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer thanks, raimo. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line brad sill bank america. line open. brad sill -- analyst great. thank much, congratulations, michael, next move. wanted ask new workload vector search, stream processing, relational migrator. one three that's ramping faster maybe expected? little bit color new workload type ramping. thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. kind give rundown -- mean, essentially asking new products, like -- search, introduced new capability called atlas search nodes, asymmetrically scale search node search-intensive use case, scale node become quite expensive. seen kind groundbreaking capability really well received. demand quite high customer like tune configuration unique need search requirements. one world's largest bank using atlas search provide like google-like search experience payment data massive corporate customers. customer-facing application performance, scalability critical. leading provider ai-powered accounting software us atlas search power invoice analytics future, allows end user finance team perform ad-hoc analysis easily find past-due invoice voice contain errors. search -- vector search, -- again, kind first full-year since going generally available. product uptake actually very, high. q3, released quantization atlas vector search, reduces memory requirement 96%, allowing u support larger vector workload vastly improved price performance. example, multinational news organization created genai powered tool designed help producer journalist efficiently search, summarize, verify information vast varied data sources. leading security firm using atlas vector search fight ai fraud leading global medium company replaced elastic search hybrid search vector search use case user recommendation engine that's built suggest -- that's built suggest article end users. that's super exciting see well. also seeing lot interest streaming product, demand high. rolled another hyperscaler, customer commenting use case able embed stream processing mongodb make life much easier. overall, quite pleased progress making new products. said before, natively bundling capability really reduces eliminates need customer bolt bunch different technology solve problem, saving lot time, money, cost, risk. brad sill -- analyst that's really exciting. thanks, dev. wanted ask question around cedric's appointment. focus may different leadership thinking going forward? thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer no, cedric cro for, gosh, like think like five, six years, -- interim cro three quarter took last made change really expansion responsibilities. known cedric long time. worked multiple different companies. think good barometer understanding sale leadership. there's number sale leader worked top-tier software company used work me. super-excited role cedric going take also making change cedric better align different organization tightly work together going up-market, app monetization positioning well ideal database genai apps. brad sill -- analyst super exciting. thanks, dev. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer thanks,

back consumption growth slightly better expectation second quarter row now. apology missed it, improvement seeing, across vintage geography potentially concentrated scope? trying get better understanding what's seeking place what's embedded guide. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. no, would describe broad-based, mike. obviously, pleased see continuing monitoring slicing dicing different ways. information insight you, share it. without trying throw whole bunch cold water mind, slightly better, step-function changed better, good see. mike cikos -- analyst terrific. maybe quick follow-up dev. think build maybe tyler's question top q&a, cited customer thinking workload holistically even looking run ai workload on-prem. much think function customer still trying figure optimize latency cost demonstration really early phase exploratory phase versus going production? way coarse two necessarily connected? thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer no, think kind little bit both. think customer committed running big part estate on-prem. definition, going build ai workload, run on-prem, mean also need access gpus that. customer leveraging basically renting gpus cloud provider building ai workloads. think very, early days. still learning, experimenting. more-and-more apps entering production. said prepared remarks, thousand workload -- ai workload running mongodb, small percentage demonstrated meaningful product market fit. initial traction kind still small. think people get sophisticated ai, ai technology matures becomes useful, think application -- start seeing application take-off. kind chuckled today see senior leader bragging chip using versus apps building. tell still very, early day big platform shift. mike cikos -- analyst great point. thank again, guys. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, mike. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line eric heath keybanc. line open. eric heath -- analyst hi, thanks taking question. dev, michael, sound like takeaway call greater focus ea enterprise. structurally rethink ea business differently think healthy double-digit growth business going forward foreseeable future? could ask follow-up question separate that. michael, understand still early identify fiscal '25 cohort workloads, curious high-level look feel like higher quality fiscal '24 cohort workflow. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer want take first one term ea... michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, mean, would say, mean, committed run anywhere strategy. said, first investing community many customer first way experience mongodb. want full experience integrating search vector search core product. gate really start building applications. transition building capability ea. so, clearly investing ea product. atlas still big, big part business big, big part growth engine typically launch new feature atlas capability already have, fact multi-cloud make very, compelling offering many customers. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. think term workloads, think early. reminder folks, tend start small, although grow quickly. think thing add is, pretty consistent pleased new business done. need time let cohort play track them. think like said, happy new business winning. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line william power baird. line open. brian raferty denyeau -- investor relation there, william? william power -- analyst sorry, yeah. thank you. dev, encouraging comment relational migrator. wonder could touch think driving higher interest here. mean, sound like ai contributing helping, great get color still feel like obviously meaningful long-term opportunity. maybe second part question dev michael, great get framework around professional service investments. way kind think quantification timing that? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. reason excited opportunity go legacy application that, one, seems like there's confluence event happening. one increasing cost tax supporting managing legacy apps going enough. second, many customer regulated industries, regulator calling -- fact running legacy apps systemic risk, longer kick road. third, also longer kick around, vendor going end-of-life, make decision migrate application modern tech stack. fourth, genai predicated data build competitive advantage, need leverage proprietary data, people want access data able easily. that's another reason want modernize. also people built application retiring longer firm, creates risk companies. given that, customer incredibly interested figuring way easily safely securely migrate -- applications. always could help easily move data map schema relational schema document schema. hardest part essentially rewriting application. advent genai, significantly reduce time. one, use genai analyze existing code. two, use genai reverse engineer test test code does. three, use genai build new code user test ensure new code produce result old code. time effort suddenly cut meaningful way that's suddenly creating lot interest customer saying, goodness. already relational app, moving another relational app feel like modernization. so, advantage moving mongodb give much modern platform, much agile, flexible, performant, scalable platform future needs. that's excited. again, early days. run number pilot gone well. process working customer migration process. take time very, complex applications. actually, one thing also mentioned going -- saying go tertiary tier 2 tier 3 application, saying, hey, want look crown jewel apps painful us. that's also exciting. again, take time, committed this, think going drive -- help u drive long-term -- meaningful long-term growth. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, will. last part question professional service investment, really building capacity order meet demand seeing relative opportunity. calling particular gross margin impact that's typically show up. maybe last thing probably obvious, sort underscore reason though arr, right, drive new workloads, additional workload mongodb part migration. time, talked before, hope expect able leverage technology more, least initially medium-term, there's going healthy human/services component that. wanted sort effectively telegraph folks. william power -- analyst that's helpful. thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, will. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line rudy kessinger da davidson. please go ahead. rudy kessinger -- analyst hey guys, thanks squeezing here. believe last quarter said consumption growth slightly ahead expectations. slower year-over-year growth versus q2 last year, year-over-year growth improve q1. so, guess curious q3, could make comment regard? obviously, slower year-over-year basis q3 last year, stable year-over-year consumption growth q2 better worse? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. rudy, thanks question. specifically called relative q2. see lower year-over-year growth called out. see seasonal rebound. usually q3 stronger q2 talked smaller prior year. hopefully, help triangulate. rudy kessinger -- analyst okay. quick follow-up. believe q4 call back march. point, dev, said would least another year ai application deployed scale. sound like commentary early large workloads, thousands, many large scale. guess, expectation maybe still least another year seeing broad ai application rollouts scale? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. think lot function what's happening r&d side ai, right? example, today, compelling model designed phones, right, today phone computing horsepower run complex models. so, see ton very, successful consumer apps besides, say, chatgpt claude. -- also see like hundred apps taking like saw kind first generation like internet cloud era, right, mobile era. like think still early day ai. see lot people building ai apps, lot kind fairly rudimentary functionality. think time that's going change. fact, know change. can't predict happen. see apps production, traction, seeing grow very, quickly

Welcome to the MongoDB third-quarter fiscal year 2025 conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there'll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your speaker for today, Brian Denyeau. Please go ahead. Brian Raferty Denyeau -- Investor Relations Thank you, Lisa. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today to review MongoDB's third-quarter fiscal 2025 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued after the close of the market today. Joining me the call today are Dev Ittycheria, president and CEO of MongoDB; and Michael Gordon, MongoDB's COO and CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our market and future growth opportunities, our expectations for the macroeconomic environment in fiscal 2025 and the impact of AI, the benefits of our product platform, our competitive landscape, customer behaviors, our financial guidance, and our planned investments in growth opportunities in AI. These statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including the results of operations and financial condition that cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. For a discussion of the material risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please refer to the risks described in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 31st, 2024 that we filed with the SEC on August 30th, 2024. Any forward-looking statements made on this call reflect our views only as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them except as required by law. Additionally, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures on this conference call. Please refer to the tables in our earnings release in the Investor Relations portion of our website for a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dev. Dev? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we had a strong quarter of new business and executed well against our large market opportunity. Let's begin by reviewing our third quarter results before giving you a broader company update. We generated revenue of $529 million, a 22% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew 26% year-over-year, representing 68% of total revenue. We generated non-GAAP operating income of $101 million for a 19% non-GAAP operating margin and we ended the quarter with over 52,600 customers. Overall, we were pleased with our performance in the third quarter. We had a strong new business quarter and we're happy with our new workload acquisition on Atlas. Our non-Atlas business significantly exceeded expectations in part because we benefited from a few large multi-year deals as customers continue to value our run anywhere strategy and want to build a deeper longer-term relationship with MongoDB. Atlas consumption was slightly better than expected in a macro-environment that we would characterize as largely consistent with what we saw in the first half of the year. Michael will cover consumption trends in more detail. Retention rates remained strong in Q3, demonstrating the mission criticality of our platform. On our Q1 earnings call, we shared with you the three major strategic initiatives that we believe will enable us to maximize our long-term opportunity. I want to give you an update on the progress we're making on those initiatives. First, we are increasing our investment in the enterprise channel since we see the strongest returns in this part of the market. Specifically, we're expanding our strategic account program going to next year, as we see more accounts that will benefit from incremental investment. In addition, we're investing time and resources to educate developers in large enterprise accounts and uplevel their MongoDB skills. These organizations have thousands of developers and as we penetrate them more deeply, we encounter developers who have historically only built SQL applications and simply do not know how to use MongoDB to its full potential. In our experience, educating these developers on the benefits of MongoDB drives significant incremental adoption of our platform. To fund these up-market investments, we are reallocating a portion of our mid-market investments. The mid-market remains an attractive opportunity for us, but we believe that prioritizing investment up-market will deliver strong returns in the current environment. We also believe there are additional ways to serve the mid-market more efficiently through our self-serve channel and other scaled technology-enabled sales and customer service motions. Second, we are optimistic about the opportunity to accelerate legacy app modernization using AI and are investing more in this area. As you recall, we ran a few successful pilots earlier this year, demonstrating that AI tooling combined with professional services and our relational migrator product can significantly reduce the time, cost, and risk of migrating legacy applications onto MongoDB. While it's early days, we have observed a more than 50% reduction in the cost to modernize. On the back of these strong early results, additional customer interest is exceeding our expectations. Large enterprises in every industry and geography are experiencing acute pain from their legacy infrastructure and are eager for more agile, performant, and cost-effective solutions. Not only are customers excited to engage with us, they also want to focus on some of the most important applications in their enterprise, further demonstrating the level of interest and size of the long-term opportunity. As relational applications encompass a wide variety of database types, programming languages, versions, and other customer-specific variables, we expect modernization projects to continue to include meaningful service engagements in the short and medium term. Consequently, we're increasing our professional services delivery capabilities, both directly and through partners. In the long run, we expect to automate and simplify large parts of the modernization process. To that end, we are leveraging the learnings from early service engagement to develop new tools to accelerate future modernization efforts. Although it's early days and scaling our legacy app modernization capabilities will take time, we have increased conviction that this motion will significantly add to our growth in the long term. Third, we are investing to capitalize on our inherent technical advantages as a key component of the emerging AI tech stack. As a reminder, MongoDB is uniquely equipped to query rich and complex data structures typical of AI applications. The ability of a database to query rich and complex data structures is crucial because AI applications often rely on highly detailed, interrelated, and nuanced data to make accurate predictions and decisions. For example, a recommendation system doesn't just analyze a single customer's purchase but also considers their browsing history, peer group behavior, and product categories requiring a database that can query and interlink these complex data structures. In addition, MongoDB's architecture unifies source data, metadata, operational data, and vector data in an all-in-one platform, updating the need for multiple database systems and complex back-end architectures. This enables a more compelling developer experience than any other alternative. From what we see in the AI market today, most customers are still in the experimental stage as they work to understand the effectiveness of the underlying tech stack and build early proof-of-concept applications. However, we are seeing an increasing number of AI apps in production. Today, we have thousands of AI apps on our platform. What we don't yet see is many of these apps actually achieving meaningful product market fit and therefore significant traction. In fact, as you take a step back and look at the entire universe of AI apps, a very small percentage of them have achieved the type of scale that we commonly see with enterprise-specific applications. We do have some AI apps that are growing quickly, including one that is already a seven-figure workload that has grown 10 times since the beginning of the year. Similar to prior platform shifts as the usefulness of AI tech improves and becomes more cost-effective, we will see the emergence of many more AI apps that do nail product market fit, but it's difficult to predict when that will happen more broadly. We remain confident that we will capture our fair share of these successful AI applications as we see that our platform is popular with developers building more sophisticated AI use cases. We continue investing in our product capabilities, including enterprise-grade Atlas Vector Search functionality to build on this momentum and even better position MongoDB to capture the AI opportunity. In addition, as previously announced, we are bringing search and vector service to our community and EA offerings, leveraging our run anywhere competitive advantage in the world of AI. Finally, we are expanding our MongoDB AI applications program or MAAP, which helps enterprise customers build and bring AI applications into production by providing them with reference architectures, integrations with leading tech providers, and coordinated services and support. Last week, we announced a new code of partners including McKinsey, Confluent, Capgemini, and Unstructured, as well as the collaboration with Meta to enable developers to build AI-enriched applications on MongoDB using Llama. Next, I'd like to provide you with a brief product update. At our dot local developer conference in London in October, we announced the general availability of MongoDB 8.0, the fastest and most performant version of MongoDB ever. MongoDB 8.0 performs 20% to 60% better against common industry benchmarks compared to our prior version and is built to exceed our customers' most stringent security, resiliency, availability, and performance requirements. To best serve our customers, we regularly review and reprioritize investments in our product portfolio to ensure we're allocating our resources to products with the highest demand from our customers. And to do that, we also deprecate products that are not showing results we desired. Consequently, we made the decision to consolidate our Atlas serverless offerings with our smallest dedicated tiers to create Atlas Flex customers, a new offering with a simpler architecture that provides the elasticity features akin to serverless. We will begin migrating effective customers to the single, simple, entry-level solution in Q4. We also decided to deprecate Atlas DeviceSync and other capabilities not widely adopted in order to focus our engineering resources on the core platform. While these reprioritization decisions are not made lightly, they allow us to deliver the most value to the largest number of customers, reinforcing our commitment to being the best modern database and helping us to grow faster. Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the adoption trends of MongoDB across our customer base. Customers across industries and around the world are running mission-critical projects in MongoDB Atlas, leveraging the full power of our developer data platform, including Financial Times, CarGurus, and Victoria's Secret. As part of the digital transformation journey, global specialty retailer Victoria's Secret & Company migrated its e-commerce platform to MongoDB Atlas. As a fully managed platform, MongoDB Atlas allowed the company to simplify its architecture and improve performance, supporting the retailer to provide a resilient, secure, and fast web and mobile e-commerce experience for their millions of customers around the world. Allianz, Alphamad, Swiss Post, and Paylocity are turning to MongoDB to modernize applications. Paylocity, a leading provider of cloud-based payroll and human capital management software, selected MongoDB to power proprietary application aimed at fostering employee connections and engagement. When traffic increased and the original SQL-based solution was unable to keep up with the required performance metrics, Paylocity migrated to MongoDB Atlas to take advantage of the flexible schema architecture, performance, and scalability. MongoDB costs five times less than the previous SQL database solution and the company's developers can now create an application within minutes, something that used to take weeks. Mature companies and start-ups alike are using MongoDB to help deliver the next wave of AI-powered application to customers, including NerdWallet, Cisco, and Tealbook. Tealbook, a supplier intelligence platform, migrated from Postgres, pgvector, and ElasticSearch to MongoDB to eliminate technical debt and consolidate their tech stack. The company experienced workload isolation and scalability issues in pgvector and were concerned with the search index inconsistencies, which were all resolved with the migration to MongoDB. With Atlas Vector search and dedicated search nodes, Tealbook has realized improved cost-efficiency and increased scalability for the supplier data platform, an application that uses GenAI to collect, verify, and enrich supplier data across various sources. In summary, we had a healthy Q3 with both Atlas and EA exceeding expectations. We saw a strong new business quarter and we remain confident in our ability to become an increasing strategic provider in our large and growing market. Looking forward, we see a great opportunity to grow our adoption in the enterprise through new workloads, modernizing legacy applications, and winning the next generation of AI-powered applications. I would like to finish by providing an update on our senior leadership. First, as we announced early in the press release, after nearly 10 years, Michael Gordon has made the decision to leave MongoDB. Michael has been instrumental in MongoDB's success over the past decade, leading our successful IPO, helping us grow our revenue nearly 50-fold, and scaling -- and successfully scaling our business model to generate meaningful operating leverage. He has been a trusted advisor and business partner to the Board and me over the years and also has become a personal friend. Michael is excited to take a well-deserved break. We have commenced the search for Michael's replacement and will be evaluating both internal and external candidates. One of Michael's proudest compliments -- accomplishments has been building a world-class finance team under his leadership, and I'm confident that we will not miss a beat during this transition. Michael will continue to serve as CFO through January 31st to help us finish the fiscal year and then will transition to an Advisor to the company to ensure a seamless process. If we have not named Michael's successor by fiscal year-end, Serge Tanjga, SVP of Finance, will serve as Interim CFO, beginning on February 1st. Second, we are promoting Cedric Pech, currently our chief revenue officer to the newly created role of president worldwide field operations. In this new position, Cedric will oversee all our field-based customer-facing and go-to-market enablement teams, including professional services. We believe this org structure will best enable us to execute on some of the key strategic initiatives I discussed earlier, in particular, our increased focus on up-market and the app monetization opportunity. I would like to congratulate Cedric on this well-deserved promotion. With that, let me turn the call over to Michael. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Dev, and thanks for the kind words and our incredible partnership over the past decade. The past 10 years have been the most rewarding in my professional career and I'm extremely proud of what we've achieved together and of course, to the whole MongoDB team. With as much success as we had, I still believe that MongoDB is in the early stages of realizing its full potential as it continues to take share in one of the largest markets in software. Now, turning to the results for the quarter. I'll begin with a detailed review of our third-quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025. First, I'll start with our third quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $529.4 million, up 22% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance. Shifting to our product mix, Atlas grew 26% in the quarter compared to the previous year and now represents 68% of total revenue compared to 66% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and 71% last quarter. We recognized Atlas revenue primarily based on customer consumption of our platform and that consumption is closely tied to end user activity of their applications. Let me provide some context on Atlas consumption in the quarter. In Q3, consumption was slightly ahead of our expectations. This year's Q3 seasonal improvement was more muted than in years past as expected. On a year-over-year basis, consumption growth remains below that of prior year period. Turning to non-Atlas revenue. Non-Atlas came in significantly ahead of our expectations. As Dev mentioned, EA new business was strong, and we continue to have success selling incremental workloads into our existing customer base. In addition, our Q3 non-Atlas revenue benefited from a few large multi-year deals. As you know, due to ASC 606, we recognized the entire term license component of a multi-year contract at the start of that contract. Compared to Q3 of last year, the multi-year license component of non-Atlas revenues was over $15 million higher. Turning to customer growth. During the third quarter, we grew our customer base by approximately 1,900 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 52,600, which is up from over 46,400 in the year-ago period. Of our total customer count, over 7,400 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 6,900 in the year-ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven primarily by Atlas, which had over 51,100 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 44,900 in the year-ago period. It is important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers adding their first Atlas workload. Continuing on, in Q3, our net ARR expansion rate was approximately 120%. We ended the quarter with 2,314 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, up from $1,972 in the year-ago period. Moving down the income statement, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the third quarter was $405.7 million, representing a gross margin of 77%, which is flat versus the year-ago period. Our income from operations was $101.5 million or 19% operating margin for the third quarter compared to an 18% operating margin in the year-ago period. The primary reason for more favorable operating income results versus guidance is our revenue outperformance, including the very high margin multi-year license revenue benefit. Net income in the third quarter was $98.1 million or $1.16 per share, based on 84.2 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a net income of $79.1 million or $0.96 per share on 83.7 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding in the year-ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the third quarter with $2.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $37.4 million. After taking into consideration approximately $2.9 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was $34.6 million in the quarter. This compares to free cash flow of $35 million in the year-ago period. In Q3, we did not incur capital expenditures to purchase IPV4 addresses as we previously expected, but we did start making those purchases in November and still expect a total outlay of $20 million to $25 million this fiscal year as we previously communicated. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $515 million to $519 million. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $55 million to $58 million and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.65 based on 84.9 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. For the full-fiscal year 2025, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.973 billion to $1.977 billion, non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $242 million to $245 million, and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $3.01 to $3.03 based on 84 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. Note that the non-GAAP net income per share guidance for the fourth-quarter and full-fiscal year 2025 includes a non-GAAP tax provision of approximately 20%. I'll now provide some more context around our updated guidance. First, in terms of Atlas consumption, we expect to see a typical seasonal slowdown in Q4, driven by underlying application usage moderating during the holiday season. Second, since Atlas consumption remained lower on a year-over-year basis in Q3, we expect to see continued deceleration of Atlas year-over-year growth in Q4. Third, we expect to see a sequential decline in non-Atlas revenue in Q4, which is contrary to our normal pattern. The reason for this is that we experienced a significant additional benefit from multi-year deals in Q3, which we do not expect to recur in Q4. In addition, I want to provide some incremental color on some of our recent product and -- how some of our recent product and go-to-market changes will impact the growth of our reported customer count going forward. First, as Dev explained, we are reallocating a portion of our go-to-market resources from the mid-market to the enterprise channel. As a result, we expect to see significantly fewer mid-market direct sales customer net additions and as a result, slower direct sales customer growth going forward. We believe this reallocation of investment dollars will drive higher revenue growth over time. So, it's a trade-off that makes sense. Second, as we introduce Atlas Flex clusters in Q4 and automatically migrate customers in Q1, we expect to see a one-time negative impact to our customer count since we have approximately 4,000 serverless customers who are very low spending and we do not expect them to transition over to Flex. These customers have a negligible impact on our revenue but will impact our reported customer count. To summarize, we're pleased with our third quarter results and especially our ability to win new business. We have a small share in one of the largest and fastest-growing markets in all of software with a number of secular tailwinds, including AI at our back. We'll continue investing judiciously and focusing on our execution to capture this long-term opportunity. With that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator? Questions & Answers: Operator [Operator instructions] Our first question for the day will be coming from Sanjit Singh of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Thank you for taking the questions and congrats, Michael, on outstanding career. You had an absolutely fantastic run at MongoDB. I'm excited to see what you do next, or excited if you just take a breather. So congrats, Michael. I guess to take the question -- to start off with the questions, when we look at what Atlas has been doing in the past two quarters, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think consumption is coming in at least modestly ahead of your expectations. Relative to what we've seen at the beginning of the year, what sort of -- is it a function of sales execution? Is it a function of the end-user activity sort of improving? What's driving at least the improvement in Atlas consumption in the past two quarters? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So a few different things. So I think if you look at our outlook at the beginning of the year, we had indicated that we thought we would see stable Atlas growth from a consumption standpoint. What we've seen and what we've talked about is -- we've actually seen lower year-over-year growth based on the underlying consumption. And so -- and that's incorporated into our Q4 guide. We have seen the Q3 and Q4 be -- sorry, Q2 and Q3, excuse me, be better than our expectations, but it's still down on a year-over-year basis. And so I want to make sure that we're not sort of confusing the comparative set of year-over-year versus relative to our expectations. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Understood. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer And the core of it, Sanjit, to your question is really the underlying usage of the applications. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Yeah, that makes total sense. And then, Dev, I have to ask you the AI agent question. In terms of an AI agent needing more context, it has going to have a set of tools to take its actions. What does it mean for MongoDB as an operational data store as customers start to roll out more agentic applications? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, just to talk about agents, I think when you think about agents, there's jobs, there's -- sorry, there's a job, there's projects and then there's task. Right now, the agents that are being rolled out are really focused on task like say something from Sierra or some other companies are rolling out agents. But you're right, what they deemed to do is to deal with being able to create a rich and complex data structures. Now why is this important for AI is that AI models don't just look at isolated data points, but they need to understand relationships, hierarchies, and patterns within the data. They need to be able to essentially get real-time insights. For example, if you have a chatbot where someone is querying, a customer is kind of trying to get some update on the order they placed five minutes ago because they may have not gotten any confirmation, your chatbot needs to be able to deal with real-time information. You need to be able to deal with basically handling very advanced use cases, understanding like, to do things like fraud detection to understand behaviors of supply chains, you need to understand intricate data relationships. All these things are consistent with MongoDB offers. And so we believe that at the end of the day, we are well-positioned to handle this. And the other thing that I would say is that we've embedded in a very natural way of search and vector search. So we're just not an OLTP database, we do tech search and vector search. That's all one experience and no other platform offers that, and we think we have a real advantage. And so we're integrated with the leading AI frameworks and platforms. We have enterprise-grade security and compliance, and customers can run us anywhere, either on 118 cloud regions or on-prem, and that again is a huge differentiator for us. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Awesome. Appreciate the thoughts, Dev. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Sanjit. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Taylor -- Tyler Radke of Citi. Your line is open. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Hi, thank you very much for taking the question. And, Michael, all the best, and congratulations on 10 years. Going back to the sales execution, I mean, one of the things that you talked about earlier this year was some challenges just in terms of the recently acquired workloads ramping. And I think a lot of those were from the past fiscal year. So curious how the quality of workload acquisition has trended this year. And as you think about the ramp in consumption potential into next year, how does that sort of look versus this time a year ago? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Maybe I'll just talk about what we're doing and the changes we made and then Michael can talk a little bit about the consumption trends. So, we did make some changes at the beginning of the year, and we really wanted to focus on both the volume and the quality of the workloads and there were some slight adjustments that we made. We think those changes are having a reasonable positive impact. Again, it's too early to declare victory because these workloads usually start small and grow over time, but we're really pleased with the results we're seeing so far. And -- but again, it's early days. And obviously, we'll know about the fiscal '25 workloads as we go into fiscal '26. But so far, so good. Michael, on consumption? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, just a couple of things, and thanks, Tyler. The fiscal '24 cohorts that we called out earlier, that slower growth does continue. They've been in line with our revised expectations. We made some changes that we talked about at the -- earlier in the year that should affect the fiscal '25 cohorts, but it's just too early to tell. On those, we need a few more quarters of data before you can really see if we're -- how we're seeing those behave differently. I will say we've talked about the new business environment and our success in new business. We have been pleased with that, but that just shows kind of the initial piece, and we need to see how they grow and how those cohorts evolve. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Great. Thanks. And follow-up on the EA side, you talked about the outsized strength in non-Atlas business this quarter. Maybe if you could unpack like the relative upside that was driven by simply duration versus new business. I know you called out the duration impact year-over-year, but are -- do you feel like this was sort of a one-off or do you feel like maybe some of your bigger customers are indexing more toward EA and how does that impact the way you think about the product and introducing things like vector search and stream processing onto the on-prem product? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, thank you. So overall, we continue to find the EA product resonate with customers. It's an important part of the run anywhere strategy and we've continued to see success with that and people wanting to increase their investment in MongoDB. There's always been a multiyear component and we continue to see that. We talked about that at the beginning of the year as to how fiscal '24 had an abnormally high amount of multi-year benefit and therefore, we were anticipating that being a headwind and we quantified that in roughly the $40 million range. What we talked about on this call earlier is we saw from a few large accounts, a surprising amount of multiyear that positively benefited Q3 at a little more than $15 million in revenue compared to what we saw Q3 a year ago. So, not as much of a headwind as we had been expecting. Obviously, with the 606 dynamics, some of these things, especially for a large deal can be kind of meaty and chunky and lumpy, which is why we try and call it out and sort of help people understand, but there's a pretty healthy kind of baseline flow, not just of EA, but also of multiyear. And when we see spikes, we just try and call it out for you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I just want to add, Tyler, that we are investing in our what we call our EA business. First, we're starting by investing with search and vector search and a community product. That does a couple of things for us. One, whenever anyone starts with MongoDB with the open-source product, they immediately get all the benefits of that complete highly integrated platform. Two, those capabilities will then migrate to EA. So, EA for us is an investment strategy. We definitely see lots of large customers who are very, very committed to running workloads on-prem. We even see some customers want to run to run AI workloads on-prem. So, the optionality they get by using MongoDB to not just be on-prem and the cloud, but also cross-cloud is a very compelling one. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Brad Reback of Stifel. Your line is open. Brad Reback -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. And, Michael, best of luck. It's been a great run. Dev, you started the call talking about a bunch of investments, which are great given the growth of the business. And obviously, you talked about reallocating some expenses. But net-net, should we think about this incremental investment phase next year as gating margin upside? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think that's something that we obviously are not ready to talk about next year just now, but I would say that we -- the reason we're looking to invest and just to summarize again, going up-market on legacy app modernization where we see very large workloads potentially at play and being the ideal database for GenAI apps, which is the future as important investments to drive long-term growth. And we're quite energized by those investments and that's something that we have high conviction on. Brad Reback -- Analyst That's great. And then on the MAAP program, are most of those workloads going to wind up in Atlas or will that be a healthy combination of EA and Atlas? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think it's again early days. I would say -- I would probably say more on the side of Atlas and EA in the early days. I think once we introduce a search and vector search into the EA product, you'll see more of that on-prem. Obviously, people can use MongoDB for AI workloads using other technologies as well in conjunction with MongoDB for on-prem AI use cases. But I would say you're probably going to see that happen first in Atlas. Brad Reback -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Jason Ader of William Blair. Your line is open. Jason Ader -- Analyst Yeah, thank you. I'm not going to belabor congratulating Michael, but it has been it has been fun working with you and best of luck. The question I had is on the strength in EA. Do you think, Dev, it represents a comment on how enterprises might be rethinking or reassessing the kind of on-prem versus cloud workload placement decision? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Well, when I think about large enterprises, I think large enterprises have meaningful workloads that are still running on-prem. I think the belief that everything would go to the cloud was probably something that was really popular in the good old days of Zurp. But I think now as customers assess their investments that they already have in place, they're being much more judicious about where they run those workloads and if they think they can leverage their existing investments in their own infrastructure, then they're going to do so. Also for a bunch of other reasons like regulatory reasons, some customers are quite not moving as aggressively to the cloud. We see that in particularly in Europe, where we see a lot of the European banks still running majority of the workloads on-prem. So it also varies by region where conversely in Asia, we're seeing people much move much more aggressively to the cloud. So I think it really depends on industry, on geography, and on the personal dynamics of what's happening in that particular account. I mean, we see some large US banks are also very committed to running things on-prem. So it really varies. And that's why we feel really good about our run anywhere strategy because it gives customer optionality. They can build something and run on-prem. And if and when they choose to move to the cloud, it's very easy to do so with MongoDB. Jason Ader -- Analyst All right. And then just as a follow-up also on the investments you're making in strategic sales and enterprise. Could you just get a little more specific on what those investments might be? Is it hiring a lot of new salespeople? Is it working more with SIs, investing more in SIs? Any additional detail would be helpful. Thanks. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So just for everyone's benefit, we've identified a number of accounts, which we call strategic accounts, which we think that have high upside for us. We've seen a number of accounts that grow very quickly when we deploy the right mix of resources. Now they're all not necessarily quota-carrying resources. They could be additional technical sales resources, additional PS resources, additional customer service resources to better service and support those accounts. We even do things like run education sessions for developers of the accounts, they're called either hackathons or like what we call developer days or even design reviews where we'll meet with our development teams who are looking to build an application, help them think about how they would potentially use MongoDB to build that particular app. And what we find is that because many of these developers, the experience with MongoDB is quite limited, the more we can engage with them, the more we can educate them and the more we can show them how simple and easy it is. Like for example, most customers today think like they have to use an OLTP database, then a search database, maybe a vector database, and then like a caching database. And all that is integrated in MongoDB. So all of a sudden, customers can say, wow, I can simplify my life, simplify my back-end infrastructure, build this app far more quickly and it will be much more easier to manage long-term if I do everything on MongoDB. And it's really a function of just educating them on the power of MongoDB that really opens up a lot of opportunities for us. So that's why we're doubling down, and the mix of resources is really predicated on the accounts, but it's not just quota counting resources, it's the whole suite of resources that we're bringing to the table. Jason Ader -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Andrew Nowinski of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Okay. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking the question and congrats on a nice quarter. You gave an example of a customer that migrated off Postgres and I think you said they had issues with their PG vector function. I was wondering how long was that customer using Postgres before they decided to make a change to Mongo, meaning was this some sort of like a rebound type customer where they chose PG -- or excuse me, Postgres and it didn't work? And then how frequently are you seeing this type of transition? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So I can't give you the specifics on how long they were using Postgres, but this is not -- this is a trend that we're seeing in our business. You have to remember Postgres is a 40-year-old technology. It's -- and they have been the beneficiary of people lifting and shifting from other types of relational databases, Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, et cetera. And they're an open-source database. And but as part -- because they're an open-source and relational database, they have the same inherent challenges all relational databases do. They're quite inflexible. So once you build a schema, it's very hard to change the schema. It's hard to scale and hard to distribute data. And if you have large data volumes, you have to do weird things like, for example, resort to off-road storage for large data objects, which creates performance bottlenecks. And so again, people default to Postgres if they don't know anything better because all they know is relational and everyone is kind of moving off those other relational platforms. And that's the whole point I was saying earlier. Once we educate developers on the flexibility of schema, how easily or horizontally scale the rich query language where you can do aggregations and do sophisticated geospatial indexes, the productivity gains by using the document model and how easy is to organize data, it's -- people are just like, wow, life is so much easier. Now I want to be clear, this is not a zero-sum game. Postgres does not have to fail for us to be successful. It's a big market and we're quite excited about the opportunity, but we do see customers moving off Postgres and coming to MongoDB. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Thank you. That was very helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up. If we normalize the $15 million multiyear deal impact you had in Q3, would EA still be down sequentially in Q4? Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer We haven't given that level of guidance, but just trying to help you understand in the context of the full-year numbers and the headwind that we talked about at the beginning of the year, just given the strength that we saw in Q3. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Got it. Thanks. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. The next question will be coming from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst Hey, thank you. And if you think about the EA strength this quarter, Michael, you'd kind of give us a little bit there. Like how should we think about renewal -- the renewal situation renewal pool coming up like or that you had in Q3, coming up in Q4, et cetera, as well and then like what does it mean in terms of upsell, cross-sell opportunity as people think about starting AI projects by self-serve, as you kind of mentioned earlier on the call? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So I think about -- if you think about EA for Q4, it tends to be a large renewal quarter, but what we're talking about in terms of the guide is because we had such strength in multiyear, that's where we would expect to see our EA down sequentially, which is not typically our pattern, which is why we called it out. In terms of AI workloads and some of those other things, I think it's early to tell and obviously, we'll continue to evolve and assess our view when we get to the full-year guide in March. And then we'll also have an updated view on how the cohorts are behaving and sort of how multiyear played out. But I think in terms of Q4, the comments that I made earlier hopefully will help. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst Yeah. Okay, perfect. And then the -- and can you talk a little bit about like obviously, there's a debate of like which database will be the persistent layer if you do AI projects, et cetera. What do you see from the big hyperscalers in terms of working with you guys and partnerships? We obviously just have AWS kind of summit, et-cetera. Can you speak a little bit like how your relationship with those big guys is evolving around this? And Michael, All the best in case I don't talk to you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, I'll start with the partnerships first, like our -- with AWS, as you said, they just had their re:Invent show last week. Our -- it remains very, very strong. We've closed a ton of deals this past quarter. Some of them very, very large deals. We're doing integrations to some of the new products like Q and Bedrock and the engagement in the field has been really strong. On Azure, I think we -- as I've shared in the past, we start-off with a little bit of a slow start, but in the words of the person who runs their partner leadership, the Azure MongoDB relationship has never been stronger. We've closed a large number of deals. We're part of what's called the Azure native IC service program and have a bunch of deep integrations with Azure, including Fabric, Power BI, Visual Studio, Semantic Kernel, and Azure OpenAI Studio. And we're also one of Azure's largest marketplace partners. And GCP does -- we have actually seen some uptick in terms of co-sales that we've done this past quarter and GCP made some comp changes where they -- that were favorable to working with MongoDB that we saw some results in the field, and we're focused on closing on -- closing a handful of large deals with GCP in Q4. So in general, I would say, things are going quite well. And then in terms of, I guess, implying your question was like the hyperscalers and are they potentially bundling things along with their AI offerings? I mean, candidly, since day one, the hyperscalers have been bundling their database offerings with every offering that they have and that's been their predominant strategy. And we've -- I think we've executed well against strategy because databases are not like a by-the-way decision. It's an important decision. And I think the hyperscalers are seeing our performance and realize it's better to partner with us. And as I said, customers understand the importance of the data layer, especially for AI applications. And so the partnership across all three hyperscalers is strong. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst OK, perfect. Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Raimo. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. The next question will be coming from the line of Brad Sills of Bank of America. Your line is open. Brad Sills -- Analyst Great. Thank you so much, and congratulations, Michael, on your next move. I wanted to ask about new workloads here on vector search, stream processing, relational migrator. Is there any one of those three that's ramping faster than maybe you expected? Just a little bit of color on how those new workload types are ramping. Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I'll kind of give you just a rundown of some of the -- I mean, essentially you're asking about the new products, like our -- on search, we introduced a new capability called Atlas search nodes, which where you can asymmetrically scale your search nodes because if you have a search-intensive use case, you don't have to scale all your nodes because they have become quite expensive. And we've seen that this kind of groundbreaking capability really well received. The demand is quite high and because customers like they can tune the configuration to the unique needs of their search requirements. One of the world's largest banks is using Atlas Search to provide like a Google-like search experience on payments data for massive corporate customers. So this is a customer-facing application and so performance, and scalability are critical. A leading provider of AI-powered accounting software uses Atlas Search to power its invoice analytics future, which allows end users and finance teams to perform ad-hoc analysis and easily find past-due invoices and voices that contain errors. So that search -- on vector search, it -- again, and it's been our kind of our first full-year since going generally available. And the product uptake has been actually very, very high. In Q3, we released quantization for Atlas Vector Search, which reduces the memory requirements by up to 96%, allowing us to support larger vector workloads with vastly improved price performance. For example, a multinational news organization created a GenAI powered tool designed to help producers and journalists efficiently search, summarize, and verify information from vast and varied data sources. A leading security firm is using Atlas Vector Search to fight AI fraud and a leading global media company replaced elastic search with hybrid search and vector search use case for a user recommendation engine that's built to suggest -- that's built in to suggest articles to end users. And so that's super exciting to see as well. We're also seeing a lot of interest in our streaming product, demand is very high. We just rolled it out to another hyperscaler, and customers are commenting on that the use cases of being able to embed stream processing with MongoDB makes our life so much easier. So overall, we're quite pleased with the progress we're making on the new products. And as I said before, natively bundling all these capabilities really reduces or eliminates the need for customers to have to bolt on a bunch of different technologies to solve the same problem, saving them a lot of time, money, cost, and risk. Brad Sills -- Analyst That's really exciting. Thanks, Dev. And then I wanted to ask a question around Cedric's appointment. Any focus that may be different here under his leadership that we should be thinking about going forward? Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer No, Cedric has been our CRO for, gosh, now like I think like five, six years, and he -- I was the Interim CRO for about three quarters until he took over when we last made a change and this is really an expansion of his responsibilities. I've known Cedric for a long time. He and I have worked with at multiple different companies. I think I have a good barometer for understanding sales leadership. There's a number of sales leaders who worked at other top-tier software companies who used to work for me or with me. And so I'm super-excited by the role Cedric is going to take and then we're also making some changes under Cedric to better align the different organizations so that we can more tightly work together on going up-market, on app monetization and positioning ourselves well to be the ideal database for GenAI apps. Brad Sills -- Analyst Super exciting. Thanks, Dev. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Brad. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question, please. Our next question will be coming from the line of Mike Cikos of Needham and Company. Your line is open. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Hey guys, thanks for taking the question here. I just wanted to come back to the consumption growth being slightly better than expectations again for the second quarter in a row now. And apologies if I missed it, but this improvement that we're seeing, is this across all vintages and geographies or is it potentially more concentrated in scope? Just trying to get a better understanding of what's seeking place out there and what's embedded in the guide. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. No, I would describe it as broad-based, Mike. And obviously, we're pleased to see it and we're continuing monitoring and slicing and dicing it in different ways. And as we have information or insights to you, we'll share it. And without trying to throw a whole bunch of cold water on our mind, it was slightly better, or a step-function changed better, but good to see. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Terrific. And maybe for a quick follow-up for Dev. I think it builds off maybe Tyler's question at the top of the Q&A, but you had cited that some customers are thinking about their workloads more holistically and even looking to run AI workloads on-prem. How much of that do you think is just a function of customers are still trying to figure out how to optimize for latency and cost or is this more a demonstration of we really are in the early phases of the exploratory phase versus going into production? Is there any way to coarse that out or is the two not necessarily connected? Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer No, I think it's kind of a little bit of both. I think you have some customers who are very committed to running a big part of the estate on-prem. So by definition, then if they're going to build an AI workload, it has to be run on-prem, which means that they also need access to GPUs and they're doing that. And then other customers are leveraging basically renting GPUs from the cloud providers and building their own AI workloads. I do think we're in the very, very early days. They're still learning, experimenting. More-and-more apps are entering production. And as I said on the prepared remarks, we have thousands of workload -- AI workloads running on MongoDB, but a very small percentage of them have demonstrated meaningful product market fit. And so the initial traction is kind of still small. But I think as people get more sophisticated with AI, as the AI technology matures and becomes more and more useful, I think applications will -- you'll start seeing these applications take-off. I kind of chuckled that today I see more senior leaders bragging about the chips they're using versus the apps they're building. So it just tells you that we're still in the very, very early days of this big platform shift. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Great point. Thank you again, guys. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Mike. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Eric Heath of KeyBanc. Your line is open. Eric Heath -- Analyst Hi, thanks for taking the question. Dev, Michael, it sounds like the takeaway from the call is a greater focus on EA and on enterprise. So should we structurally rethink the EA business differently and think of this more as a healthy double-digit growth business going forward for the foreseeable future? And then if I could just ask a follow-up question separate to that. But Michael, I understand that it's still early to identify the fiscal '25 cohort of workloads, but just curious at a high-level if they look and feel like of higher quality than the fiscal '24 cohort of workflow. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Do you want to take on the first one in terms of EA... Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, I mean, I would say, I mean, we are very committed to our run anywhere strategy. And as I said, we are first investing in community where for many customers is the first way they experience MongoDB. And we want them to have the full experience of integrating search and Vector search into our core product. And so they can out of the gate really start building applications. That will then transition to building those capabilities into EA. So, we are clearly investing in the EA product. But Atlas is still a big, big part of our business and a big, big part of our growth engine and we typically launch new features on Atlas and because of the capabilities we already have, the fact it's multi-cloud makes it a very, very compelling offering for many customers. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. And I think in terms of the workloads, I do think it's early. Just as a reminder for folks, they tend to start small, although grow quickly. I think the only other thing that I can add is, we've been pretty consistent and that we've been pleased with the new business that we've done. But we need some time to let the cohorts play out as we track them. But I think like I said, we've been happy with the new business that we were winning. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of William Power of Baird. Your line is open. Brian Raferty Denyeau -- Investor Relations You there, William? William Power -- Analyst Sorry, yeah. Thank you. Dev, you had some encouraging comments on relational migrator. I wonder if you could just touch on what you think is driving the higher interest here. I mean, it sounds like AI is contributing and helping, but it'd be great to get some more color there because that still feels like obviously a meaningful long-term opportunity. And then maybe the second part of the question for Dev or Michael, just be great to get any other framework around the professional services investments. Any way to kind of think about quantification and timing of that? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So the reason we're so excited about the opportunity to go after legacy applications is that, one, it seems like there's a confluence of events happening. One is that the increasing cost and tax of supporting and managing these legacy apps are just going up enough. Second, for many customers who are in regulated industries, the regulators are calling their -- the fact that they're running on these legacy apps with systemic risk, so they can no longer kick the can down the road. Third, also because they no longer can kick the can around, some vendors are going end-of-life, so they have to make a decision to migrate those applications to a more modern tech stack. Fourth, because GenAI is so predicated on data and to build a competitive advantage, you need to leverage your proprietary data, people want to access that data and be able to do so easily. And so that's another reason for them to want to modernize. And then you also have people who built those applications who are retiring or just no longer in the firm, so it just creates more and more risk for the companies. Given all that, customers are incredibly interested in figuring out a way to easily and safely and securely migrate those -- off those applications. And we always could help them very easily move the data and map the schema from a relational schema to a document schema. The hardest part was essentially rewriting the application. Now with the advent of GenAI, you can now significantly reduce the time. One, you can use GenAI to analyze existing code. Two, you can use GenAI to reverse engineer tests to test what the code does. And then three, you can use GenAI to build new code and then users test it to ensure that the new code produces the same results as the old code. And so all that time and effort is suddenly cut in a meaningful way and that's suddenly creating a lot of interest from customers saying, my goodness. And if you're already on a relational app, moving to another relational app doesn't feel like modernization. So, the other advantage is that moving to MongoDB gives them a much more modern platform, a much more agile, flexible, performant, and scalable platform for their future needs. And that's why we're so excited. Again, it's early days. We've run a number of pilots that have gone well. We're in the process of working with some customers now in the migration process. This will take time because these are very, very complex applications. And actually, one thing I also mentioned was that they're not just going after -- saying go after some tertiary Tier 2 or Tier 3 application, they're saying, hey, we want you to look at some of our crown jewels because these are the apps that are most painful for us. So that's also very exciting. But again, this will take time, but we're very committed to this, and we think this is going to drive -- help us drive long-term -- meaningful long-term growth. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, Will. And to the last part of your question on the professional services investment, we're really building out that capacity in order to meet the demand that we're seeing relative to the opportunity. We're calling it in particular because it has a gross margin impact because that's where that will typically show up. And then maybe the last thing and it's probably obvious, but just to sort of underscore it is the reason we're doing this though is for the ARR, right, to drive the new workloads, the additional workloads over to MongoDB as part of that migration. And over time, as we've talked about before, we hope and expect to be able to leverage technology more and more, but at least initially and into the medium-term, there's going to be a healthy human/services component to that. Just wanted to sort of effectively telegraph that out to folks. William Power -- Analyst That's helpful. Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Will. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Rudy Kessinger of DA Davidson. Please go ahead. Rudy Kessinger -- Analyst Hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in here. I believe last quarter you said consumption growth slightly ahead of expectations. And while down slower year-over-year growth versus Q2 last year, the year-over-year growth did improve from Q1. And so, I guess I'm curious for Q3, could you make a comment in that same regard? Obviously, slower on a year-over-year basis than Q3 last year, but was it stable with year-over-year consumption growth in Q2 or better or worse? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Rudy, thanks for the question. We haven't specifically called that out relative to Q2. We did see a lower year-over-year growth as we called out. We did see a seasonal rebound. Usually Q3 is stronger than Q2 and we talked about how that was smaller than in the prior year. So hopefully, that will help you all triangulate. Rudy Kessinger -- Analyst Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. I believe it was on your Q4 call back in March. At that point, Dev, you said it would be at least another year until AI applications are being deployed at scale. It sounds like the commentary that some early large workloads, but out of the thousands, just not many that are at large scale. I guess, is your expectation now that maybe it's still at least another year until we're seeing broad AI application rollouts at scale? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I think a lot of it's a function of the what's happening in the R&D side of AI, right? So for example, today, we don't have a very compelling model designed for our phones, right, because today the phones don't have the computing horsepower to run complex models. So, you don't see a ton of very, very successful consumer apps besides, say, ChatGPT or Claude. So we don't -- we also don't see like hundreds of apps taking off like you saw kind of the first generation of like the Internet or the cloud era, right, or the mobile era. So like I think we're still in the early days of AI. And so while we see a lot of people building AI apps, a lot of them have kind of fairly rudimentary functionality. But I think that over time that's going to change. In fact, I know it will change. I just can't predict when that will happen. But where we do see apps having production, we are having traction, we're seeing them grow very, very quickly and we have a lot of them on our platform. It's just very few of them are really have meaningful. Operator Thank you. And that concludes today's Q&A session. I would like to go ahead and turn the call back over to Dev for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, everyone. I just wanted to say we're really pleased with our Q3 results with strong new business performance and revenue exceeding expectations both -- across both Atlas and EA. We're making the necessary investments to expand our enterprise channel where we see the largest opportunity to establish MongoDB as a standard and the strongest returns on our go-to-market investments. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the progress we're making on both accelerating legacy app modernization with AI as well as establishing ourselves as a standard of the emerging AI tech stack for greenfield AI applications. And last but not least, I would like to thank Michael again for his contributions over the past 10 years and wish him well. Thank you, everyone, and we'll talk to you soon.

operator? question & answers: operator [operator instructions] first question day coming sanjit singh morgan stanley. line open. sanjit singh -- analyst thank taking question congrats, michael, outstanding career. absolutely fantastic run mongodb. excited see next, excited take breather. congrats, michael. guess take question -- start questions, look atlas past two quarters, correct wrong, think consumption coming least modestly ahead expectations. relative seen beginning year, sort -- function sale execution? function end-user activity sort improving? what's driving least improvement atlas consumption past two quarters? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. different things. think look outlook beginning year, indicated thought would see stable atlas growth consumption standpoint. seen talked -- actually seen lower year-over-year growth based underlying consumption. -- that's incorporated q4 guide. seen q3 q4 -- sorry, q2 q3, excuse me, better expectations, still year-over-year basis. want make sure sort confusing comparative set year-over-year versus relative expectations. sanjit singh -- analyst understood. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer core it, sanjit, question really underlying usage applications. sanjit singh -- analyst yeah, make total sense. then, dev, ask ai agent question. term ai agent needing context, going set tool take actions. mean mongodb operational data store customer start roll agentic applications? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. so, talk agents, think think agents, there's jobs, there's -- sorry, there's job, there's project there's task. right now, agent rolled really focused task like say something sierra company rolling agents. right, deemed deal able create rich complex data structures. important ai ai model look isolated data points, need understand relationships, hierarchies, pattern within data. need able essentially get real-time insights. example, chatbot someone querying, customer kind trying get update order placed five minute ago may gotten confirmation, chatbot need able deal real-time information. need able deal basically handling advanced use cases, understanding like, thing like fraud detection understand behavior supply chains, need understand intricate data relationships. thing consistent mongodb offers. believe end day, well-positioned handle this. thing would say embedded natural way search vector search. oltp database, tech search vector search. that's one experience platform offer that, think real advantage. integrated leading ai framework platforms. enterprise-grade security compliance, customer run u anywhere, either 118 cloud region on-prem, huge differentiator us. sanjit singh -- analyst awesome. appreciate thoughts, dev. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, sanjit. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line taylor -- tyler radke citi. line open. tyler radke -- analyst hi, thank much taking question. and, michael, best, congratulation 10 years. going back sale execution, mean, one thing talked earlier year challenge term recently acquired workload ramping. think lot past fiscal year. curious quality workload acquisition trended year. think ramp consumption potential next year, sort look versus time year ago? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. maybe talk change made michael talk little bit consumption trends. so, make change beginning year, really wanted focus volume quality workload slight adjustment made. think change reasonable positive impact. again, early declare victory workload usually start small grow time, really pleased result seeing far. -- again, early days. obviously, know fiscal '25 workload go fiscal '26. far, good. michael, consumption? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, couple things, thanks, tyler. fiscal '24 cohort called earlier, slower growth continue. line revised expectations. made change talked -- earlier year affect fiscal '25 cohorts, early tell. those, need quarter data really see -- seeing behave differently. say talked new business environment success new business. pleased that, show kind initial piece, need see grow cohort evolve. tyler radke -- analyst great. thanks. follow-up ea side, talked outsized strength non-atlas business quarter. maybe could unpack like relative upside driven simply duration versus new business. know called duration impact year-over-year, -- feel like sort one-off feel like maybe bigger customer indexing toward ea impact way think product introducing thing like vector search stream processing onto on-prem product? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah, thank you. overall, continue find ea product resonate customers. important part run anywhere strategy continued see success people wanting increase investment mongodb. there's always multiyear component continue see that. talked beginning year fiscal '24 abnormally high amount multi-year benefit therefore, anticipating headwind quantified roughly $40 million range. talked call earlier saw large accounts, surprising amount multiyear positively benefited q3 little $15 million revenue compared saw q3 year ago. so, much headwind expecting. obviously, 606 dynamics, things, especially large deal kind meaty chunky lumpy, try call sort help people understand, there's pretty healthy kind baseline flow, ea, also multiyear. see spikes, try call you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. want add, tyler, investing call ea business. first, starting investing search vector search community product. couple thing us. one, whenever anyone start mongodb open-source product, immediately get benefit complete highly integrated platform. two, capability migrate ea. so, ea u investment strategy. definitely see lot large customer very, committed running workload on-prem. even see customer want run run ai workload on-prem. so, optionality get using mongodb on-prem cloud, also cross-cloud compelling one. tyler radke -- analyst thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line brad reback stifel. line open. brad reback -- analyst great. thanks much. and, michael, best luck. great run. dev, started call talking bunch investments, great given growth business. obviously, talked reallocating expenses. net-net, think incremental investment phase next year gating margin upside? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer think that's something obviously ready talk next year now, would say -- reason looking invest summarize again, going up-market legacy app modernization see large workload potentially play ideal database genai apps, future important investment drive long-term growth. quite energized investment that's something high conviction on. brad reback -- analyst that's great. maap program, workload going wind atlas healthy combination ea atlas? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer think early days. would say -- would probably say side atlas ea early days. think introduce search vector search ea product, see on-prem. obviously, people use mongodb ai workload using technology well conjunction mongodb on-prem ai use cases. would say probably going see happen first atlas. brad reback -- analyst great. thanks much. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line jason ader william blair. line open. jason ader -- analyst yeah, thank you. going belabor congratulating michael, fun working best luck. question strength ea. think, dev, represents comment enterprise might rethinking reassessing kind on-prem versus cloud workload placement decision? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer well, think large enterprises, think large enterprise meaningful workload still running on-prem. think belief everything would go cloud probably something really popular good old day zurp. think customer assess investment already place, much judicious run workload think leverage existing investment infrastructure, going so. also bunch reason like regulatory reasons, customer quite moving aggressively cloud. see particularly europe, see lot european bank still running majority workload on-prem. also varies region conversely asia, seeing people much move much aggressively cloud. think really depends industry, geography, personal dynamic what's happening particular account. mean, see large u bank also committed running thing on-prem. really varies. that's feel really good run anywhere strategy give customer optionality. build something run on-prem. choose move cloud, easy mongodb. jason ader -- analyst right. follow-up also investment making strategic sale enterprise. could get little specific investment might be? hiring lot new salespeople? working sis, investing sis? additional detail would helpful. thanks. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. everyone's benefit, identified number accounts, call strategic accounts, think high upside us. seen number account grow quickly deploy right mix resources. necessarily quota-carrying resources. could additional technical sale resources, additional p resources, additional customer service resource better service support accounts. even thing like run education session developer accounts, called either hackathons like call developer day even design review meet development team looking build application, help think would potentially use mongodb build particular app. find many developers, experience mongodb quite limited, engage them, educate show simple easy is. like example, customer today think like use oltp database, search database, maybe vector database, like caching database. integrated mongodb. sudden, customer say, wow, simplify life, simplify back-end infrastructure, build app far quickly much easier manage long-term everything mongodb. really function educating power mongodb really open lot opportunity us. that's doubling down, mix resource really predicated accounts, quota counting resources, whole suite resource bringing table. jason ader -- analyst thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line andrew nowinski well fargo. line open. andrew nowinski -- analyst okay. good afternoon. thank much taking question congrats nice quarter. gave example customer migrated postgres think said issue pg vector function. wondering long customer using postgres decided make change mongo, meaning sort like rebound type customer chose pg -- excuse me, postgres work? frequently seeing type transition? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. can't give specific long using postgres, -- trend seeing business. remember postgres 40-year-old technology. -- beneficiary people lifting shifting type relational databases, oracle, sql server, mysql, et cetera. open-source database. part -- open-source relational database, inherent challenge relational database do. quite inflexible. build schema, hard change schema. hard scale hard distribute data. large data volumes, weird thing like, example, resort off-road storage large data objects, creates performance bottlenecks. again, people default postgres know anything better know relational everyone kind moving relational platforms. that's whole point saying earlier. educate developer flexibility schema, easily horizontally scale rich query language aggregation sophisticated geospatial indexes, productivity gain using document model easy organize data, -- people like, wow, life much easier. want clear, zero-sum game. postgres fail u successful. big market quite excited opportunity, see customer moving postgres coming mongodb. andrew nowinski -- analyst thank you. helpful. maybe quick follow-up. normalize $15 million multiyear deal impact q3, would ea still sequentially q4? thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer given level guidance, trying help understand context full-year number headwind talked beginning year, given strength saw q3. andrew nowinski -- analyst got it. thanks. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line raimo lenschow barclays. line open. raimo lenschow -- analyst hey, thank you. think ea strength quarter, michael, kind give u little bit there. like think renewal -- renewal situation renewal pool coming like q3, coming q4, et cetera, well like mean term upsell, cross-sell opportunity people think starting ai project self-serve, kind mentioned earlier call? michael gordon -- chief

new product like q bedrock engagement field really strong. azure, think -- shared past, start-off little bit slow start, word person run partner leadership, azure mongodb relationship never stronger. closed large number deals. part what's called azure native ic service program bunch deep integration azure, including fabric, power bi, visual studio, semantic kernel, azure openai studio. also one azure's largest marketplace partners. gcp -- actually seen uptick term co-sales done past quarter gcp made comp change -- favorable working mongodb saw result field, focused closing -- closing handful large deal gcp q4. general, would say, thing going quite well. term of, guess, implying question like hyperscalers potentially bundling thing along ai offerings? mean, candidly, since day one, hyperscalers bundling database offering every offering that's predominant strategy. -- think executed well strategy database like by-the-way decision. important decision. think hyperscalers seeing performance realize better partner us. said, customer understand importance data layer, especially ai applications. partnership across three hyperscalers strong. raimo lenschow -- analyst ok, perfect. thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer thanks, raimo. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line brad sill bank america. line open. brad sill -- analyst great. thank much, congratulations, michael, next move. wanted ask new workload vector search, stream processing, relational migrator. one three that's ramping faster maybe expected? little bit color new workload type ramping. thank you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. kind give rundown -- mean, essentially asking new products, like -- search, introduced new capability called atlas search nodes, asymmetrically scale search node search-intensive use case, scale node become quite expensive. seen kind groundbreaking capability really well received. demand quite high customer like tune configuration unique need search requirements. one world's largest bank using atlas search provide like google-like search experience payment data massive corporate customers. customer-facing application performance, scalability critical. leading provider ai-powered accounting software us atlas search power invoice analytics future, allows end user finance team perform ad-hoc analysis easily find past-due invoice voice contain errors. search -- vector search, -- again, kind first full-year since going generally available. product uptake actually very, high. q3, released quantization atlas vector search, reduces memory requirement 96%, allowing u support larger vector workload vastly improved price performance. example, multinational news organization created genai powered tool designed help producer journalist efficiently search, summarize, verify information vast varied data sources. leading security firm using atlas vector search fight ai fraud leading global medium company replaced elastic search hybrid search vector search use case user recommendation engine that's built suggest -- that's built suggest article end users. that's super exciting see well. also seeing lot interest streaming product, demand high. rolled another hyperscaler, customer commenting use case able embed stream processing mongodb make life much easier. overall, quite pleased progress making new products. said before, natively bundling capability really reduces eliminates need customer bolt bunch different technology solve problem,

part growth engine typically launch new feature atlas capability already have, fact multi-cloud make very, compelling offering many customers. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. think term workloads, think early. reminder folks, tend start small, although grow quickly. think thing add is, pretty consistent pleased new business done. need time let cohort play track them. think like said, happy new business winning. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line william power baird. line open. brian raferty denyeau -- investor relation there, william? william power -- analyst sorry, yeah. thank you. dev, encouraging comment relational migrator. wonder could touch think driving higher interest here. mean, sound like ai contributing helping, great get color still feel like obviously meaningful long-term opportunity. maybe second part question dev michael, great get framework around professional service investments. way kind think quantification timing that? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. reason excited opportunity go legacy application that, one, seems like there's confluence event happening. one increasing cost tax supporting managing legacy apps going enough. second, many customer regulated industries, regulator calling -- fact running legacy apps systemic risk, longer kick road. third, also longer kick around, vendor going end-of-life, make decision migrate application modern tech stack. fourth, genai predicated data build competitive advantage, need leverage proprietary data, people want access data able easily. that's another reason want modernize. also people built application retiring longer firm, creates risk companies. given that, customer incredibly interested figuring way easily safely securely migrate -- applications. always could help easily move data map schema relational schema document schema. hardest part essentially rewriting application. advent genai, significantly reduce time. one, use genai analyze existing code. two, use genai reverse engineer test test code does. three, use genai build new code user test ensure new code produce result old code. time effort suddenly cut meaningful way that's suddenly creating lot interest customer saying, goodness. already relational app, moving another relational app feel like modernization. so, advantage moving mongodb give much modern platform, much agile, flexible, performant, scalable platform future needs. that's excited. again, early days. run number pilot gone well. process working customer migration process. take time very, complex applications. actually, one thing also mentioned going -- saying go tertiary tier 2 tier 3 application, saying, hey, want look crown jewel apps painful us. that's also exciting. again, take time, committed this, think going drive -- help u drive long-term -- meaningful long-term growth. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, will. last part question professional service investment, really building capacity order meet demand seeing relative opportunity. calling particular gross margin impact that's typically show up. maybe last thing probably obvious, sort underscore reason though arr, right, drive new workloads, additional workload mongodb part migration. time, talked before, hope expect able leverage technology more, least initially medium-term, there's going healthy human/services component that. wanted sort effectively telegraph folks. william power -- analyst that's helpful. thank you. dev c. ittycheria

Welcome to the MongoDB third-quarter fiscal year 2025 conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there'll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your speaker for today, Brian Denyeau. Please go ahead. Brian Raferty Denyeau -- Investor Relations Thank you, Lisa. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today to review MongoDB's third-quarter fiscal 2025 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued after the close of the market today. Joining me the call today are Dev Ittycheria, president and CEO of MongoDB; and Michael Gordon, MongoDB's COO and CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our market and future growth opportunities, our expectations for the macroeconomic environment in fiscal 2025 and the impact of AI, the benefits of our product platform, our competitive landscape, customer behaviors, our financial guidance, and our planned investments in growth opportunities in AI. These statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including the results of operations and financial condition that cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. For a discussion of the material risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please refer to the risks described in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 31st, 2024 that we filed with the SEC on August 30th, 2024. Any forward-looking statements made on this call reflect our views only as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them except as required by law. Additionally, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures on this conference call. Please refer to the tables in our earnings release in the Investor Relations portion of our website for a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dev. Dev? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we had a strong quarter of new business and executed well against our large market opportunity. Let's begin by reviewing our third quarter results before giving you a broader company update. We generated revenue of $529 million, a 22% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew 26% year-over-year, representing 68% of total revenue. We generated non-GAAP operating income of $101 million for a 19% non-GAAP operating margin and we ended the quarter with over 52,600 customers. Overall, we were pleased with our performance in the third quarter. We had a strong new business quarter and we're happy with our new workload acquisition on Atlas. Our non-Atlas business significantly exceeded expectations in part because we benefited from a few large multi-year deals as customers continue to value our run anywhere strategy and want to build a deeper longer-term relationship with MongoDB. Atlas consumption was slightly better than expected in a macro-environment that we would characterize as largely consistent with what we saw in the first half of the year. Michael will cover consumption trends in more detail. Retention rates remained strong in Q3, demonstrating the mission criticality of our platform. On our Q1 earnings call, we shared with you the three major strategic initiatives that we believe will enable us to maximize our long-term opportunity. I want to give you an update on the progress we're making on those initiatives. First, we are increasing our investment in the enterprise channel since we see the strongest returns in this part of the market. Specifically, we're expanding our strategic account program going to next year, as we see more accounts that will benefit from incremental investment. In addition, we're investing time and resources to educate developers in large enterprise accounts and uplevel their MongoDB skills. These organizations have thousands of developers and as we penetrate them more deeply, we encounter developers who have historically only built SQL applications and simply do not know how to use MongoDB to its full potential. In our experience, educating these developers on the benefits of MongoDB drives significant incremental adoption of our platform. To fund these up-market investments, we are reallocating a portion of our mid-market investments. The mid-market remains an attractive opportunity for us, but we believe that prioritizing investment up-market will deliver strong returns in the current environment. We also believe there are additional ways to serve the mid-market more efficiently through our self-serve channel and other scaled technology-enabled sales and customer service motions. Second, we are optimistic about the opportunity to accelerate legacy app modernization using AI and are investing more in this area. As you recall, we ran a few successful pilots earlier this year, demonstrating that AI tooling combined with professional services and our relational migrator product can significantly reduce the time, cost, and risk of migrating legacy applications onto MongoDB. While it's early days, we have observed a more than 50% reduction in the cost to modernize. On the back of these strong early results, additional customer interest is exceeding our expectations. Large enterprises in every industry and geography are experiencing acute pain from their legacy infrastructure and are eager for more agile, performant, and cost-effective solutions. Not only are customers excited to engage with us, they also want to focus on some of the most important applications in their enterprise, further demonstrating the level of interest and size of the long-term opportunity. As relational applications encompass a wide variety of database types, programming languages, versions, and other customer-specific variables, we expect modernization projects to continue to include meaningful service engagements in the short and medium term. Consequently, we're increasing our professional services delivery capabilities, both directly and through partners. In the long run, we expect to automate and simplify large parts of the modernization process. To that end, we are leveraging the learnings from early service engagement to develop new tools to accelerate future modernization efforts. Although it's early days and scaling our legacy app modernization capabilities will take time, we have increased conviction that this motion will significantly add to our growth in the long term. Third, we are investing to capitalize on our inherent technical advantages as a key component of the emerging AI tech stack. As a reminder, MongoDB is uniquely equipped to query rich and complex data structures typical of AI applications. The ability of a database to query rich and complex data structures is crucial because AI applications often rely on highly detailed, interrelated, and nuanced data to make accurate predictions and decisions. For example, a recommendation system doesn't just analyze a single customer's purchase but also considers their browsing history, peer group behavior, and product categories requiring a database that can query and interlink these complex data structures. In addition, MongoDB's architecture unifies source data, metadata, operational data, and vector data in an all-in-one platform, updating the need for multiple database systems and complex back-end architectures. This enables a more compelling developer experience than any other alternative. From what we see in the AI market today, most customers are still in the experimental stage as they work to understand the effectiveness of the underlying tech stack and build early proof-of-concept applications. However, we are seeing an increasing number of AI apps in production. Today, we have thousands of AI apps on our platform. What we don't yet see is many of these apps actually achieving meaningful product market fit and therefore significant traction. In fact, as you take a step back and look at the entire universe of AI apps, a very small percentage of them have achieved the type of scale that we commonly see with enterprise-specific applications. We do have some AI apps that are growing quickly, including one that is already a seven-figure workload that has grown 10 times since the beginning of the year. Similar to prior platform shifts as the usefulness of AI tech improves and becomes more cost-effective, we will see the emergence of many more AI apps that do nail product market fit, but it's difficult to predict when that will happen more broadly. We remain confident that we will capture our fair share of these successful AI applications as we see that our platform is popular with developers building more sophisticated AI use cases. We continue investing in our product capabilities, including enterprise-grade Atlas Vector Search functionality to build on this momentum and even better position MongoDB to capture the AI opportunity. In addition, as previously announced, we are bringing search and vector service to our community and EA offerings, leveraging our run anywhere competitive advantage in the world of AI. Finally, we are expanding our MongoDB AI applications program or MAAP, which helps enterprise customers build and bring AI applications into production by providing them with reference architectures, integrations with leading tech providers, and coordinated services and support. Last week, we announced a new code of partners including McKinsey, Confluent, Capgemini, and Unstructured, as well as the collaboration with Meta to enable developers to build AI-enriched applications on MongoDB using Llama. Next, I'd like to provide you with a brief product update. At our dot local developer conference in London in October, we announced the general availability of MongoDB 8.0, the fastest and most performant version of MongoDB ever. MongoDB 8.0 performs 20% to 60% better against common industry benchmarks compared to our prior version and is built to exceed our customers' most stringent security, resiliency, availability, and performance requirements. To best serve our customers, we regularly review and reprioritize investments in our product portfolio to ensure we're allocating our resources to products with the highest demand from our customers. And to do that, we also deprecate products that are not showing results we desired. Consequently, we made the decision to consolidate our Atlas serverless offerings with our smallest dedicated tiers to create Atlas Flex customers, a new offering with a simpler architecture that provides the elasticity features akin to serverless. We will begin migrating effective customers to the single, simple, entry-level solution in Q4. We also decided to deprecate Atlas DeviceSync and other capabilities not widely adopted in order to focus our engineering resources on the core platform. While these reprioritization decisions are not made lightly, they allow us to deliver the most value to the largest number of customers, reinforcing our commitment to being the best modern database and helping us to grow faster. Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the adoption trends of MongoDB across our customer base. Customers across industries and around the world are running mission-critical projects in MongoDB Atlas, leveraging the full power of our developer data platform, including Financial Times, CarGurus, and Victoria's Secret. As part of the digital transformation journey, global specialty retailer Victoria's Secret & Company migrated its e-commerce platform to MongoDB Atlas. As a fully managed platform, MongoDB Atlas allowed the company to simplify its architecture and improve performance, supporting the retailer to provide a resilient, secure, and fast web and mobile e-commerce experience for their millions of customers around the world. Allianz, Alphamad, Swiss Post, and Paylocity are turning to MongoDB to modernize applications. Paylocity, a leading provider of cloud-based payroll and human capital management software, selected MongoDB to power proprietary application aimed at fostering employee connections and engagement. When traffic increased and the original SQL-based solution was unable to keep up with the required performance metrics, Paylocity migrated to MongoDB Atlas to take advantage of the flexible schema architecture, performance, and scalability. MongoDB costs five times less than the previous SQL database solution and the company's developers can now create an application within minutes, something that used to take weeks. Mature companies and start-ups alike are using MongoDB to help deliver the next wave of AI-powered application to customers, including NerdWallet, Cisco, and Tealbook. Tealbook, a supplier intelligence platform, migrated from Postgres, pgvector, and ElasticSearch to MongoDB to eliminate technical debt and consolidate their tech stack. The company experienced workload isolation and scalability issues in pgvector and were concerned with the search index inconsistencies, which were all resolved with the migration to MongoDB. With Atlas Vector search and dedicated search nodes, Tealbook has realized improved cost-efficiency and increased scalability for the supplier data platform, an application that uses GenAI to collect, verify, and enrich supplier data across various sources. In summary, we had a healthy Q3 with both Atlas and EA exceeding expectations. We saw a strong new business quarter and we remain confident in our ability to become an increasing strategic provider in our large and growing market. Looking forward, we see a great opportunity to grow our adoption in the enterprise through new workloads, modernizing legacy applications, and winning the next generation of AI-powered applications. I would like to finish by providing an update on our senior leadership. First, as we announced early in the press release, after nearly 10 years, Michael Gordon has made the decision to leave MongoDB. Michael has been instrumental in MongoDB's success over the past decade, leading our successful IPO, helping us grow our revenue nearly 50-fold, and scaling -- and successfully scaling our business model to generate meaningful operating leverage. He has been a trusted advisor and business partner to the Board and me over the years and also has become a personal friend. Michael is excited to take a well-deserved break. We have commenced the search for Michael's replacement and will be evaluating both internal and external candidates. One of Michael's proudest compliments -- accomplishments has been building a world-class finance team under his leadership, and I'm confident that we will not miss a beat during this transition. Michael will continue to serve as CFO through January 31st to help us finish the fiscal year and then will transition to an Advisor to the company to ensure a seamless process. If we have not named Michael's successor by fiscal year-end, Serge Tanjga, SVP of Finance, will serve as Interim CFO, beginning on February 1st. Second, we are promoting Cedric Pech, currently our chief revenue officer to the newly created role of president worldwide field operations. In this new position, Cedric will oversee all our field-based customer-facing and go-to-market enablement teams, including professional services. We believe this org structure will best enable us to execute on some of the key strategic initiatives I discussed earlier, in particular, our increased focus on up-market and the app monetization opportunity. I would like to congratulate Cedric on this well-deserved promotion. With that, let me turn the call over to Michael. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Dev, and thanks for the kind words and our incredible partnership over the past decade. The past 10 years have been the most rewarding in my professional career and I'm extremely proud of what we've achieved together and of course, to the whole MongoDB team. With as much success as we had, I still believe that MongoDB is in the early stages of realizing its full potential as it continues to take share in one of the largest markets in software. Now, turning to the results for the quarter. I'll begin with a detailed review of our third-quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025. First, I'll start with our third quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $529.4 million, up 22% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance. Shifting to our product mix, Atlas grew 26% in the quarter compared to the previous year and now represents 68% of total revenue compared to 66% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and 71% last quarter. We recognized Atlas revenue primarily based on customer consumption of our platform and that consumption is closely tied to end user activity of their applications. Let me provide some context on Atlas consumption in the quarter. In Q3, consumption was slightly ahead of our expectations. This year's Q3 seasonal improvement was more muted than in years past as expected. On a year-over-year basis, consumption growth remains below that of prior year period. Turning to non-Atlas revenue. Non-Atlas came in significantly ahead of our expectations. As Dev mentioned, EA new business was strong, and we continue to have success selling incremental workloads into our existing customer base. In addition, our Q3 non-Atlas revenue benefited from a few large multi-year deals. As you know, due to ASC 606, we recognized the entire term license component of a multi-year contract at the start of that contract. Compared to Q3 of last year, the multi-year license component of non-Atlas revenues was over $15 million higher. Turning to customer growth. During the third quarter, we grew our customer base by approximately 1,900 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 52,600, which is up from over 46,400 in the year-ago period. Of our total customer count, over 7,400 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 6,900 in the year-ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven primarily by Atlas, which had over 51,100 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 44,900 in the year-ago period. It is important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers adding their first Atlas workload. Continuing on, in Q3, our net ARR expansion rate was approximately 120%. We ended the quarter with 2,314 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, up from $1,972 in the year-ago period. Moving down the income statement, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the third quarter was $405.7 million, representing a gross margin of 77%, which is flat versus the year-ago period. Our income from operations was $101.5 million or 19% operating margin for the third quarter compared to an 18% operating margin in the year-ago period. The primary reason for more favorable operating income results versus guidance is our revenue outperformance, including the very high margin multi-year license revenue benefit. Net income in the third quarter was $98.1 million or $1.16 per share, based on 84.2 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a net income of $79.1 million or $0.96 per share on 83.7 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding in the year-ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the third quarter with $2.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $37.4 million. After taking into consideration approximately $2.9 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was $34.6 million in the quarter. This compares to free cash flow of $35 million in the year-ago period. In Q3, we did not incur capital expenditures to purchase IPV4 addresses as we previously expected, but we did start making those purchases in November and still expect a total outlay of $20 million to $25 million this fiscal year as we previously communicated. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $515 million to $519 million. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $55 million to $58 million and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.65 based on 84.9 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. For the full-fiscal year 2025, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.973 billion to $1.977 billion, non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $242 million to $245 million, and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $3.01 to $3.03 based on 84 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. Note that the non-GAAP net income per share guidance for the fourth-quarter and full-fiscal year 2025 includes a non-GAAP tax provision of approximately 20%. I'll now provide some more context around our updated guidance. First, in terms of Atlas consumption, we expect to see a typical seasonal slowdown in Q4, driven by underlying application usage moderating during the holiday season. Second, since Atlas consumption remained lower on a year-over-year basis in Q3, we expect to see continued deceleration of Atlas year-over-year growth in Q4. Third, we expect to see a sequential decline in non-Atlas revenue in Q4, which is contrary to our normal pattern. The reason for this is that we experienced a significant additional benefit from multi-year deals in Q3, which we do not expect to recur in Q4. In addition, I want to provide some incremental color on some of our recent product and -- how some of our recent product and go-to-market changes will impact the growth of our reported customer count going forward. First, as Dev explained, we are reallocating a portion of our go-to-market resources from the mid-market to the enterprise channel. As a result, we expect to see significantly fewer mid-market direct sales customer net additions and as a result, slower direct sales customer growth going forward. We believe this reallocation of investment dollars will drive higher revenue growth over time. So, it's a trade-off that makes sense. Second, as we introduce Atlas Flex clusters in Q4 and automatically migrate customers in Q1, we expect to see a one-time negative impact to our customer count since we have approximately 4,000 serverless customers who are very low spending and we do not expect them to transition over to Flex. These customers have a negligible impact on our revenue but will impact our reported customer count. To summarize, we're pleased with our third quarter results and especially our ability to win new business. We have a small share in one of the largest and fastest-growing markets in all of software with a number of secular tailwinds, including AI at our back. We'll continue investing judiciously and focusing on our execution to capture this long-term opportunity. With that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator? Questions & Answers: Operator [Operator instructions] Our first question for the day will be coming from Sanjit Singh of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Thank you for taking the questions and congrats, Michael, on outstanding career. You had an absolutely fantastic run at MongoDB. I'm excited to see what you do next, or excited if you just take a breather. So congrats, Michael. I guess to take the question -- to start off with the questions, when we look at what Atlas has been doing in the past two quarters, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think consumption is coming in at least modestly ahead of your expectations. Relative to what we've seen at the beginning of the year, what sort of -- is it a function of sales execution? Is it a function of the end-user activity sort of improving? What's driving at least the improvement in Atlas consumption in the past two quarters? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So a few different things. So I think if you look at our outlook at the beginning of the year, we had indicated that we thought we would see stable Atlas growth from a consumption standpoint. What we've seen and what we've talked about is -- we've actually seen lower year-over-year growth based on the underlying consumption. And so -- and that's incorporated into our Q4 guide. We have seen the Q3 and Q4 be -- sorry, Q2 and Q3, excuse me, be better than our expectations, but it's still down on a year-over-year basis. And so I want to make sure that we're not sort of confusing the comparative set of year-over-year versus relative to our expectations. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Understood. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer And the core of it, Sanjit, to your question is really the underlying usage of the applications. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Yeah, that makes total sense. And then, Dev, I have to ask you the AI agent question. In terms of an AI agent needing more context, it has going to have a set of tools to take its actions. What does it mean for MongoDB as an operational data store as customers start to roll out more agentic applications? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, just to talk about agents, I think when you think about agents, there's jobs, there's -- sorry, there's a job, there's projects and then there's task. Right now, the agents that are being rolled out are really focused on task like say something from Sierra or some other companies are rolling out agents. But you're right, what they deemed to do is to deal with being able to create a rich and complex data structures. Now why is this important for AI is that AI models don't just look at isolated data points, but they need to understand relationships, hierarchies, and patterns within the data. They need to be able to essentially get real-time insights. For example, if you have a chatbot where someone is querying, a customer is kind of trying to get some update on the order they placed five minutes ago because they may have not gotten any confirmation, your chatbot needs to be able to deal with real-time information. You need to be able to deal with basically handling very advanced use cases, understanding like, to do things like fraud detection to understand behaviors of supply chains, you need to understand intricate data relationships. All these things are consistent with MongoDB offers. And so we believe that at the end of the day, we are well-positioned to handle this. And the other thing that I would say is that we've embedded in a very natural way of search and vector search. So we're just not an OLTP database, we do tech search and vector search. That's all one experience and no other platform offers that, and we think we have a real advantage. And so we're integrated with the leading AI frameworks and platforms. We have enterprise-grade security and compliance, and customers can run us anywhere, either on 118 cloud regions or on-prem, and that again is a huge differentiator for us. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Awesome. Appreciate the thoughts, Dev. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Sanjit. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Taylor -- Tyler Radke of Citi. Your line is open. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Hi, thank you very much for taking the question. And, Michael, all the best, and congratulations on 10 years. Going back to the sales execution, I mean, one of the things that you talked about earlier this year was some challenges just in terms of the recently acquired workloads ramping. And I think a lot of those were from the past fiscal year. So curious how the quality of workload acquisition has trended this year. And as you think about the ramp in consumption potential into next year, how does that sort of look versus this time a year ago? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Maybe I'll just talk about what we're doing and the changes we made and then Michael can talk a little bit about the consumption trends. So, we did make some changes at the beginning of the year, and we really wanted to focus on both the volume and the quality of the workloads and there were some slight adjustments that we made. We think those changes are having a reasonable positive impact. Again, it's too early to declare victory because these workloads usually start small and grow over time, but we're really pleased with the results we're seeing so far. And -- but again, it's early days. And obviously, we'll know about the fiscal '25 workloads as we go into fiscal '26. But so far, so good. Michael, on consumption? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, just a couple of things, and thanks, Tyler. The fiscal '24 cohorts that we called out earlier, that slower growth does continue. They've been in line with our revised expectations. We made some changes that we talked about at the -- earlier in the year that should affect the fiscal '25 cohorts, but it's just too early to tell. On those, we need a few more quarters of data before you can really see if we're -- how we're seeing those behave differently. I will say we've talked about the new business environment and our success in new business. We have been pleased with that, but that just shows kind of the initial piece, and we need to see how they grow and how those cohorts evolve. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Great. Thanks. And follow-up on the EA side, you talked about the outsized strength in non-Atlas business this quarter. Maybe if you could unpack like the relative upside that was driven by simply duration versus new business. I know you called out the duration impact year-over-year, but are -- do you feel like this was sort of a one-off or do you feel like maybe some of your bigger customers are indexing more toward EA and how does that impact the way you think about the product and introducing things like vector search and stream processing onto the on-prem product? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, thank you. So overall, we continue to find the EA product resonate with customers. It's an important part of the run anywhere strategy and we've continued to see success with that and people wanting to increase their investment in MongoDB. There's always been a multiyear component and we continue to see that. We talked about that at the beginning of the year as to how fiscal '24 had an abnormally high amount of multi-year benefit and therefore, we were anticipating that being a headwind and we quantified that in roughly the $40 million range. What we talked about on this call earlier is we saw from a few large accounts, a surprising amount of multiyear that positively benefited Q3 at a little more than $15 million in revenue compared to what we saw Q3 a year ago. So, not as much of a headwind as we had been expecting. Obviously, with the 606 dynamics, some of these things, especially for a large deal can be kind of meaty and chunky and lumpy, which is why we try and call it out and sort of help people understand, but there's a pretty healthy kind of baseline flow, not just of EA, but also of multiyear. And when we see spikes, we just try and call it out for you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I just want to add, Tyler, that we are investing in our what we call our EA business. First, we're starting by investing with search and vector search and a community product. That does a couple of things for us. One, whenever anyone starts with MongoDB with the open-source product, they immediately get all the benefits of that complete highly integrated platform. Two, those capabilities will then migrate to EA. So, EA for us is an investment strategy. We definitely see lots of large customers who are very, very committed to running workloads on-prem. We even see some customers want to run to run AI workloads on-prem. So, the optionality they get by using MongoDB to not just be on-prem and the cloud, but also cross-cloud is a very compelling one. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Brad Reback of Stifel. Your line is open. Brad Reback -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. And, Michael, best of luck. It's been a great run. Dev, you started the call talking about a bunch of investments, which are great given the growth of the business. And obviously, you talked about reallocating some expenses. But net-net, should we think about this incremental investment phase next year as gating margin upside? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think that's something that we obviously are not ready to talk about next year just now, but I would say that we -- the reason we're looking to invest and just to summarize again, going up-market on legacy app modernization where we see very large workloads potentially at play and being the ideal database for GenAI apps, which is the future as important investments to drive long-term growth. And we're quite energized by those investments and that's something that we have high conviction on. Brad Reback -- Analyst That's great. And then on the MAAP program, are most of those workloads going to wind up in Atlas or will that be a healthy combination of EA and Atlas? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think it's again early days. I would say -- I would probably say more on the side of Atlas and EA in the early days. I think once we introduce a search and vector search into the EA product, you'll see more of that on-prem. Obviously, people can use MongoDB for AI workloads using other technologies as well in conjunction with MongoDB for on-prem AI use cases. But I would say you're probably going to see that happen first in Atlas. Brad Reback -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Jason Ader of William Blair. Your line is open. Jason Ader -- Analyst Yeah, thank you. I'm not going to belabor congratulating Michael, but it has been it has been fun working with you and best of luck. The question I had is on the strength in EA. Do you think, Dev, it represents a comment on how enterprises might be rethinking or reassessing the kind of on-prem versus cloud workload placement decision? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Well, when I think about large enterprises, I think large enterprises have meaningful workloads that are still running on-prem. I think the belief that everything would go to the cloud was probably something that was really popular in the good old days of Zurp. But I think now as customers assess their investments that they already have in place, they're being much more judicious about where they run those workloads and if they think they can leverage their existing investments in their own infrastructure, then they're going to do so. Also for a bunch of other reasons like regulatory reasons, some customers are quite not moving as aggressively to the cloud. We see that in particularly in Europe, where we see a lot of the European banks still running majority of the workloads on-prem. So it also varies by region where conversely in Asia, we're seeing people much move much more aggressively to the cloud. So I think it really depends on industry, on geography, and on the personal dynamics of what's happening in that particular account. I mean, we see some large US banks are also very committed to running things on-prem. So it really varies. And that's why we feel really good about our run anywhere strategy because it gives customer optionality. They can build something and run on-prem. And if and when they choose to move to the cloud, it's very easy to do so with MongoDB. Jason Ader -- Analyst All right. And then just as a follow-up also on the investments you're making in strategic sales and enterprise. Could you just get a little more specific on what those investments might be? Is it hiring a lot of new salespeople? Is it working more with SIs, investing more in SIs? Any additional detail would be helpful. Thanks. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So just for everyone's benefit, we've identified a number of accounts, which we call strategic accounts, which we think that have high upside for us. We've seen a number of accounts that grow very quickly when we deploy the right mix of resources. Now they're all not necessarily quota-carrying resources. They could be additional technical sales resources, additional PS resources, additional customer service resources to better service and support those accounts. We even do things like run education sessions for developers of the accounts, they're called either hackathons or like what we call developer days or even design reviews where we'll meet with our development teams who are looking to build an application, help them think about how they would potentially use MongoDB to build that particular app. And what we find is that because many of these developers, the experience with MongoDB is quite limited, the more we can engage with them, the more we can educate them and the more we can show them how simple and easy it is. Like for example, most customers today think like they have to use an OLTP database, then a search database, maybe a vector database, and then like a caching database. And all that is integrated in MongoDB. So all of a sudden, customers can say, wow, I can simplify my life, simplify my back-end infrastructure, build this app far more quickly and it will be much more easier to manage long-term if I do everything on MongoDB. And it's really a function of just educating them on the power of MongoDB that really opens up a lot of opportunities for us. So that's why we're doubling down, and the mix of resources is really predicated on the accounts, but it's not just quota counting resources, it's the whole suite of resources that we're bringing to the table. Jason Ader -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Andrew Nowinski of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Okay. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking the question and congrats on a nice quarter. You gave an example of a customer that migrated off Postgres and I think you said they had issues with their PG vector function. I was wondering how long was that customer using Postgres before they decided to make a change to Mongo, meaning was this some sort of like a rebound type customer where they chose PG -- or excuse me, Postgres and it didn't work? And then how frequently are you seeing this type of transition? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So I can't give you the specifics on how long they were using Postgres, but this is not -- this is a trend that we're seeing in our business. You have to remember Postgres is a 40-year-old technology. It's -- and they have been the beneficiary of people lifting and shifting from other types of relational databases, Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, et cetera. And they're an open-source database. And but as part -- because they're an open-source and relational database, they have the same inherent challenges all relational databases do. They're quite inflexible. So once you build a schema, it's very hard to change the schema. It's hard to scale and hard to distribute data. And if you have large data volumes, you have to do weird things like, for example, resort to off-road storage for large data objects, which creates performance bottlenecks. And so again, people default to Postgres if they don't know anything better because all they know is relational and everyone is kind of moving off those other relational platforms. And that's the whole point I was saying earlier. Once we educate developers on the flexibility of schema, how easily or horizontally scale the rich query language where you can do aggregations and do sophisticated geospatial indexes, the productivity gains by using the document model and how easy is to organize data, it's -- people are just like, wow, life is so much easier. Now I want to be clear, this is not a zero-sum game. Postgres does not have to fail for us to be successful. It's a big market and we're quite excited about the opportunity, but we do see customers moving off Postgres and coming to MongoDB. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Thank you. That was very helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up. If we normalize the $15 million multiyear deal impact you had in Q3, would EA still be down sequentially in Q4? Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer We haven't given that level of guidance, but just trying to help you understand in the context of the full-year numbers and the headwind that we talked about at the beginning of the year, just given the strength that we saw in Q3. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Got it. Thanks. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. The next question will be coming from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst Hey, thank you. And if you think about the EA strength this quarter, Michael, you'd kind of give us a little bit there. Like how should we think about renewal -- the renewal situation renewal pool coming up like or that you had in Q3, coming up in Q4, et cetera, as well and then like what does it mean in terms of upsell, cross-sell opportunity as people think about starting AI projects by self-serve, as you kind of mentioned earlier on the call? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So I think about -- if you think about EA for Q4, it tends to be a large renewal quarter, but what we're talking about in terms of the guide is because we had such strength in multiyear, that's where we would expect to see our EA down sequentially, which is not typically our pattern, which is why we called it out. In terms of AI workloads and some of those other things, I think it's early to tell and obviously, we'll continue to evolve and assess our view when we get to the full-year guide in March. And then we'll also have an updated view on how the cohorts are behaving and sort of how multiyear played out. But I think in terms of Q4, the comments that I made earlier hopefully will help. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst Yeah. Okay, perfect. And then the -- and can you talk a little bit about like obviously, there's a debate of like which database will be the persistent layer if you do AI projects, et cetera. What do you see from the big hyperscalers in terms of working with you guys and partnerships? We obviously just have AWS kind of summit, et-cetera. Can you speak a little bit like how your relationship with those big guys is evolving around this? And Michael, All the best in case I don't talk to you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, I'll start with the partnerships first, like our -- with AWS, as you said, they just had their re:Invent show last week. Our -- it remains very, very strong. We've closed a ton of deals this past quarter. Some of them very, very large deals. We're doing integrations to some of the new products like Q and Bedrock and the engagement in the field has been really strong. On Azure, I think we -- as I've shared in the past, we start-off with a little bit of a slow start, but in the words of the person who runs their partner leadership, the Azure MongoDB relationship has never been stronger. We've closed a large number of deals. We're part of what's called the Azure native IC service program and have a bunch of deep integrations with Azure, including Fabric, Power BI, Visual Studio, Semantic Kernel, and Azure OpenAI Studio. And we're also one of Azure's largest marketplace partners. And GCP does -- we have actually seen some uptick in terms of co-sales that we've done this past quarter and GCP made some comp changes where they -- that were favorable to working with MongoDB that we saw some results in the field, and we're focused on closing on -- closing a handful of large deals with GCP in Q4. So in general, I would say, things are going quite well. And then in terms of, I guess, implying your question was like the hyperscalers and are they potentially bundling things along with their AI offerings? I mean, candidly, since day one, the hyperscalers have been bundling their database offerings with every offering that they have and that's been their predominant strategy. And we've -- I think we've executed well against strategy because databases are not like a by-the-way decision. It's an important decision. And I think the hyperscalers are seeing our performance and realize it's better to partner with us. And as I said, customers understand the importance of the data layer, especially for AI applications. And so the partnership across all three hyperscalers is strong. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst OK, perfect. Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Raimo. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. The next question will be coming from the line of Brad Sills of Bank of America. Your line is open. Brad Sills -- Analyst Great. Thank you so much, and congratulations, Michael, on your next move. I wanted to ask about new workloads here on vector search, stream processing, relational migrator. Is there any one of those three that's ramping faster than maybe you expected? Just a little bit of color on how those new workload types are ramping. Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I'll kind of give you just a rundown of some of the -- I mean, essentially you're asking about the new products, like our -- on search, we introduced a new capability called Atlas search nodes, which where you can asymmetrically scale your search nodes because if you have a search-intensive use case, you don't have to scale all your nodes because they have become quite expensive. And we've seen that this kind of groundbreaking capability really well received. The demand is quite high and because customers like they can tune the configuration to the unique needs of their search requirements. One of the world's largest banks is using Atlas Search to provide like a Google-like search experience on payments data for massive corporate customers. So this is a customer-facing application and so performance, and scalability are critical. A leading provider of AI-powered accounting software uses Atlas Search to power its invoice analytics future, which allows end users and finance teams to perform ad-hoc analysis and easily find past-due invoices and voices that contain errors. So that search -- on vector search, it -- again, and it's been our kind of our first full-year since going generally available. And the product uptake has been actually very, very high. In Q3, we released quantization for Atlas Vector Search, which reduces the memory requirements by up to 96%, allowing us to support larger vector workloads with vastly improved price performance. For example, a multinational news organization created a GenAI powered tool designed to help producers and journalists efficiently search, summarize, and verify information from vast and varied data sources. A leading security firm is using Atlas Vector Search to fight AI fraud and a leading global media company replaced elastic search with hybrid search and vector search use case for a user recommendation engine that's built to suggest -- that's built in to suggest articles to end users. And so that's super exciting to see as well. We're also seeing a lot of interest in our streaming product, demand is very high. We just rolled it out to another hyperscaler, and customers are commenting on that the use cases of being able to embed stream processing with MongoDB makes our life so much easier. So overall, we're quite pleased with the progress we're making on the new products. And as I said before, natively bundling all these capabilities really reduces or eliminates the need for customers to have to bolt on a bunch of different technologies to solve the same problem, saving them a lot of time, money, cost, and risk. Brad Sills -- Analyst That's really exciting. Thanks, Dev. And then I wanted to ask a question around Cedric's appointment. Any focus that may be different here under his leadership that we should be thinking about going forward? Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer No, Cedric has been our CRO for, gosh, now like I think like five, six years, and he -- I was the Interim CRO for about three quarters until he took over when we last made a change and this is really an expansion of his responsibilities. I've known Cedric for a long time. He and I have worked with at multiple different companies. I think I have a good barometer for understanding sales leadership. There's a number of sales leaders who worked at other top-tier software companies who used to work for me or with me. And so I'm super-excited by the role Cedric is going to take and then we're also making some changes under Cedric to better align the different organizations so that we can more tightly work together on going up-market, on app monetization and positioning ourselves well to be the ideal database for GenAI apps. Brad Sills -- Analyst Super exciting. Thanks, Dev. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Brad. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question, please. Our next question will be coming from the line of Mike Cikos of Needham and Company. Your line is open. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Hey guys, thanks for taking the question here. I just wanted to come back to the consumption growth being slightly better than expectations again for the second quarter in a row now. And apologies if I missed it, but this improvement that we're seeing, is this across all vintages and geographies or is it potentially more concentrated in scope? Just trying to get a better understanding of what's seeking place out there and what's embedded in the guide. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. No, I would describe it as broad-based, Mike. And obviously, we're pleased to see it and we're continuing monitoring and slicing and dicing it in different ways. And as we have information or insights to you, we'll share it. And without trying to throw a whole bunch of cold water on our mind, it was slightly better, or a step-function changed better, but good to see. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Terrific. And maybe for a quick follow-up for Dev. I think it builds off maybe Tyler's question at the top of the Q&A, but you had cited that some customers are thinking about their workloads more holistically and even looking to run AI workloads on-prem. How much of that do you think is just a function of customers are still trying to figure out how to optimize for latency and cost or is this more a demonstration of we really are in the early phases of the exploratory phase versus going into production? Is there any way to coarse that out or is the two not necessarily connected? Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer No, I think it's kind of a little bit of both. I think you have some customers who are very committed to running a big part of the estate on-prem. So by definition, then if they're going to build an AI workload, it has to be run on-prem, which means that they also need access to GPUs and they're doing that. And then other customers are leveraging basically renting GPUs from the cloud providers and building their own AI workloads. I do think we're in the very, very early days. They're still learning, experimenting. More-and-more apps are entering production. And as I said on the prepared remarks, we have thousands of workload -- AI workloads running on MongoDB, but a very small percentage of them have demonstrated meaningful product market fit. And so the initial traction is kind of still small. But I think as people get more sophisticated with AI, as the AI technology matures and becomes more and more useful, I think applications will -- you'll start seeing these applications take-off. I kind of chuckled that today I see more senior leaders bragging about the chips they're using versus the apps they're building. So it just tells you that we're still in the very, very early days of this big platform shift. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Great point. Thank you again, guys. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Mike. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Eric Heath of KeyBanc. Your line is open. Eric Heath -- Analyst Hi, thanks for taking the question. Dev, Michael, it sounds like the takeaway from the call is a greater focus on EA and on enterprise. So should we structurally rethink the EA business differently and think of this more as a healthy double-digit growth business going forward for the foreseeable future? And then if I could just ask a follow-up question separate to that. But Michael, I understand that it's still early to identify the fiscal '25 cohort of workloads, but just curious at a high-level if they look and feel like of higher quality than the fiscal '24 cohort of workflow. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Do you want to take on the first one in terms of EA... Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, I mean, I would say, I mean, we are very committed to our run anywhere strategy. And as I said, we are first investing in community where for many customers is the first way they experience MongoDB. And we want them to have the full experience of integrating search and Vector search into our core product. And so they can out of the gate really start building applications. That will then transition to building those capabilities into EA. So, we are clearly investing in the EA product. But Atlas is still a big, big part of our business and a big, big part of our growth engine and we typically launch new features on Atlas and because of the capabilities we already have, the fact it's multi-cloud makes it a very, very compelling offering for many customers. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. And I think in terms of the workloads, I do think it's early. Just as a reminder for folks, they tend to start small, although grow quickly. I think the only other thing that I can add is, we've been pretty consistent and that we've been pleased with the new business that we've done. But we need some time to let the cohorts play out as we track them. But I think like I said, we've been happy with the new business that we were winning. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of William Power of Baird. Your line is open. Brian Raferty Denyeau -- Investor Relations You there, William? William Power -- Analyst Sorry, yeah. Thank you. Dev, you had some encouraging comments on relational migrator. I wonder if you could just touch on what you think is driving the higher interest here. I mean, it sounds like AI is contributing and helping, but it'd be great to get some more color there because that still feels like obviously a meaningful long-term opportunity. And then maybe the second part of the question for Dev or Michael, just be great to get any other framework around the professional services investments. Any way to kind of think about quantification and timing of that? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So the reason we're so excited about the opportunity to go after legacy applications is that, one, it seems like there's a confluence of events happening. One is that the increasing cost and tax of supporting and managing these legacy apps are just going up enough. Second, for many customers who are in regulated industries, the regulators are calling their -- the fact that they're running on these legacy apps with systemic risk, so they can no longer kick the can down the road. Third, also because they no longer can kick the can around, some vendors are going end-of-life, so they have to make a decision to migrate those applications to a more modern tech stack. Fourth, because GenAI is so predicated on data and to build a competitive advantage, you need to leverage your proprietary data, people want to access that data and be able to do so easily. And so that's another reason for them to want to modernize. And then you also have people who built those applications who are retiring or just no longer in the firm, so it just creates more and more risk for the companies. Given all that, customers are incredibly interested in figuring out a way to easily and safely and securely migrate those -- off those applications. And we always could help them very easily move the data and map the schema from a relational schema to a document schema. The hardest part was essentially rewriting the application. Now with the advent of GenAI, you can now significantly reduce the time. One, you can use GenAI to analyze existing code. Two, you can use GenAI to reverse engineer tests to test what the code does. And then three, you can use GenAI to build new code and then users test it to ensure that the new code produces the same results as the old code. And so all that time and effort is suddenly cut in a meaningful way and that's suddenly creating a lot of interest from customers saying, my goodness. And if you're already on a relational app, moving to another relational app doesn't feel like modernization. So, the other advantage is that moving to MongoDB gives them a much more modern platform, a much more agile, flexible, performant, and scalable platform for their future needs. And that's why we're so excited. Again, it's early days. We've run a number of pilots that have gone well. We're in the process of working with some customers now in the migration process. This will take time because these are very, very complex applications. And actually, one thing I also mentioned was that they're not just going after -- saying go after some tertiary Tier 2 or Tier 3 application, they're saying, hey, we want you to look at some of our crown jewels because these are the apps that are most painful for us. So that's also very exciting. But again, this will take time, but we're very committed to this, and we think this is going to drive -- help us drive long-term -- meaningful long-term growth. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, Will. And to the last part of your question on the professional services investment, we're really building out that capacity in order to meet the demand that we're seeing relative to the opportunity. We're calling it in particular because it has a gross margin impact because that's where that will typically show up. And then maybe the last thing and it's probably obvious, but just to sort of underscore it is the reason we're doing this though is for the ARR, right, to drive the new workloads, the additional workloads over to MongoDB as part of that migration. And over time, as we've talked about before, we hope and expect to be able to leverage technology more and more, but at least initially and into the medium-term, there's going to be a healthy human/services component to that. Just wanted to sort of effectively telegraph that out to folks. William Power -- Analyst That's helpful. Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Will. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Rudy Kessinger of DA Davidson. Please go ahead. Rudy Kessinger -- Analyst Hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in here. I believe last quarter you said consumption growth slightly ahead of expectations. And while down slower year-over-year growth versus Q2 last year, the year-over-year growth did improve from Q1. And so, I guess I'm curious for Q3, could you make a comment in that same regard? Obviously, slower on a year-over-year basis than Q3 last year, but was it stable with year-over-year consumption growth in Q2 or better or worse? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Rudy, thanks for the question. We haven't specifically called that out relative to Q2. We did see a lower year-over-year growth as we called out. We did see a seasonal rebound. Usually Q3 is stronger than Q2 and we talked about how that was smaller than in the prior year. So hopefully, that will help you all triangulate. Rudy Kessinger -- Analyst Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. I believe it was on your Q4 call back in March. At that point, Dev, you said it would be at least another year until AI applications are being deployed at scale. It sounds like the commentary that some early large workloads, but out of the thousands, just not many that are at large scale. I guess, is your expectation now that maybe it's still at least another year until we're seeing broad AI application rollouts at scale? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I think a lot of it's a function of the what's happening in the R&D side of AI, right? So for example, today, we don't have a very compelling model designed for our phones, right, because today the phones don't have the computing horsepower to run complex models. So, you don't see a ton of very, very successful consumer apps besides, say, ChatGPT or Claude. So we don't -- we also don't see like hundreds of apps taking off like you saw kind of the first generation of like the Internet or the cloud era, right, or the mobile era. So like I think we're still in the early days of AI. And so while we see a lot of people building AI apps, a lot of them have kind of fairly rudimentary functionality. But I think that over time that's going to change. In fact, I know it will change. I just can't predict when that will happen. But where we do see apps having production, we are having traction, we're seeing them grow very, very quickly and we have a lot of them on our platform. It's just very few of them are really have meaningful. Operator Thank you. And that concludes today's Q&A session. I would like to go ahead and turn the call back over to Dev for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, everyone. I just wanted to say we're really pleased with our Q3 results with strong new business performance and revenue exceeding expectations both -- across both Atlas and EA. We're making the necessary investments to expand our enterprise channel where we see the largest opportunity to establish MongoDB as a standard and the strongest returns on our go-to-market investments. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the progress we're making on both accelerating legacy app modernization with AI as well as establishing ourselves as a standard of the emerging AI tech stack for greenfield AI applications. And last but not least, I would like to thank Michael again for his contributions over the past 10 years and wish him well. Thank you, everyone, and we'll talk to you soon.

decade. past 10 year rewarding professional career extremely proud achieved together course, whole mongodb team. much success had, still believe mongodb early stage realizing full potential continues take share one largest market software. now, turning result quarter. begin detailed review third-quarter result finish outlook fourth quarter full fiscal year 2025. first, start third quarter results. total revenue quarter $529.4 million, 22% year-over-year high end guidance. shifting product mix, atlas grew 26% quarter compared previous year represents 68% total revenue compared 66% third quarter fiscal 2024 71% last quarter. recognized atlas revenue primarily based customer consumption platform consumption closely tied end user activity applications. let provide context atlas consumption quarter. q3, consumption slightly ahead expectations. year's q3 seasonal improvement muted year past expected. year-over-year basis, consumption growth remains prior year period. turning non-atlas revenue. non-atlas came significantly ahead expectations. dev mentioned, ea new business strong, continue success selling incremental workload existing customer base. addition, q3 non-atlas revenue benefited large multi-year deals. know, due asc 606, recognized entire term license component multi-year contract start contract. compared q3 last year, multi-year license component non-atlas revenue $15 million higher. turning customer growth. third quarter, grew customer base approximately 1,900 customer sequentially, bringing total customer count 52,600, 46,400 year-ago period. total customer count, 7,400 direct sale customers, compare 6,900 year-ago period. growth total customer count driven primarily atlas, 51,100 customer end quarter compared 44,900 year-ago period. important keep mind

non-gaap tax provision approximately 20%. provide context around updated guidance. first, term atlas consumption, expect see typical seasonal slowdown q4, driven underlying application usage moderating holiday season. second, since atlas consumption remained lower year-over-year basis q3, expect see continued deceleration atlas year-over-year growth q4. third, expect see sequential decline non-atlas revenue q4, contrary normal pattern. reason experienced significant additional benefit multi-year deal q3, expect recur q4. addition, want provide incremental color recent product -- recent product go-to-market change impact growth reported customer count going forward. first, dev explained, reallocating portion go-to-market resource mid-market enterprise channel. result, expect see significantly fewer mid-market direct sale customer net addition result, slower direct sale customer growth going forward. believe reallocation investment dollar drive higher revenue growth time. so, trade-off make sense. second, introduce atlas flex cluster q4 automatically migrate customer q1, expect see one-time negative impact customer count since approximately 4,000 serverless customer low spending expect transition flex. customer negligible impact revenue impact reported customer count. summarize, pleased third quarter result especially ability win new business. small share one largest fastest-growing market software number secular tailwinds, including ai back. continue investing judiciously focusing execution capture long-term opportunity. that, like open questions. operator? question & answers: operator [operator instructions] first question day coming sanjit singh morgan stanley. line open. sanjit singh -- analyst thank taking question congrats, michael, outstanding career. absolutely fantastic run mongodb. excited see next, excited take breather. congrats, michael. guess take question -- start questions, look atlas past two quarters, correct wrong, think consumption coming least modestly ahead expectations. relative seen beginning year, sort -- function sale execution? function end-user activity sort improving? what's driving least improvement atlas consumption past two quarters? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. different things. think look outlook beginning year, indicated thought would see stable atlas growth consumption standpoint. seen talked -- actually seen lower year-over-year growth based underlying consumption. -- that's incorporated q4 guide. seen q3 q4 -- sorry, q2 q3, excuse me, better expectations, still year-over-year basis. want make sure sort confusing comparative set year-over-year versus relative expectations. sanjit singh -- analyst understood. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer core it, sanjit, question really underlying usage applications. sanjit singh -- analyst yeah, make total sense. then, dev, ask ai agent question. term ai agent needing context, going set tool take actions. mean mongodb operational data store customer start roll agentic applications? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. so, talk agents, think think agents, there's jobs, there's -- sorry, there's job, there's project there's task. right now, agent rolled really focused task like say something sierra company rolling agents. right, deemed deal able create rich complex data structures. important ai ai model look isolated data points, need understand relationships, hierarchies, pattern within data. need able essentially get real-time insights. example, chatbot someone querying, customer kind trying get update order placed five minute ago may gotten confirmation, chatbot need able deal real-time information. need able deal basically handling advanced use cases, understanding like, thing like fraud detection understand behavior supply chains, need understand intricate data relationships. thing consistent mongodb offers. believe end day, well-positioned handle this. thing would say embedded natural way search vector search. oltp database, tech search vector search. that's one experience platform offer that, think real advantage. integrated leading ai framework platforms. enterprise-grade security compliance, customer run u anywhere, either 118 cloud region on-prem, huge differentiator us. sanjit singh -- analyst awesome. appreciate thoughts, dev. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, sanjit. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line taylor -- tyler radke citi. line open. tyler radke -- analyst hi, thank much taking question. and, michael, best, congratulation 10 years. going back sale execution, mean, one thing talked earlier year challenge term recently acquired workload ramping. think lot past fiscal year. curious quality workload acquisition trended year. think ramp consumption potential next year, sort look versus time year ago? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. maybe talk change made michael talk little bit consumption trends. so, make change beginning year, really wanted focus volume quality workload slight adjustment made. think change reasonable positive impact. again, early declare victory workload usually start small grow time, really pleased result seeing far. -- again, early days. obviously, know fiscal '25 workload go fiscal '26. far, good. michael, consumption? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, couple things, thanks, tyler. fiscal '24 cohort called earlier, slower growth continue. line revised expectations. made change talked -- earlier year affect fiscal '25 cohorts, early tell. those, need quarter data really see -- seeing behave differently. say talked new business environment success new business. pleased that, show kind initial piece, need see grow cohort evolve. tyler radke -- analyst great. thanks. follow-up ea side, talked outsized strength non-atlas business quarter. maybe could unpack like relative upside driven simply duration versus new business. know called duration impact year-over-year, -- feel like sort one-off feel like maybe bigger customer indexing toward ea impact way think product introducing thing like vector search stream processing onto on-prem product? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah, thank you. overall, continue find ea product resonate customers. important part run anywhere strategy continued see success people wanting increase investment mongodb. there's always multiyear component continue see that. talked beginning year fiscal '24 abnormally high amount multi-year benefit therefore, anticipating headwind quantified roughly $40 million range. talked call earlier saw large accounts, surprising amount multiyear positively benefited q3 little $15 million revenue compared saw q3 year ago. so, much headwind expecting. obviously, 606 dynamics, things, especially large deal kind meaty chunky lumpy, try call sort help people understand, there's pretty healthy kind baseline flow, ea, also multiyear. see spikes, try call you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. want add, tyler, investing call ea business. first, starting investing search vector search community product. couple thing us. one, whenever anyone start mongodb open-source product, immediately get benefit complete highly integrated platform. two, capability migrate ea. so, ea u investment strategy. definitely see lot large customer very, committed running workload on-prem. even see customer want run run ai workload on-prem. so, optionality get using mongodb on-prem cloud, also cross-cloud compelling one. tyler radke -- analyst thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line brad reback stifel. line open. brad reback -- analyst great. thanks much. and, michael, best luck. great run. dev, started call talking bunch investments, great given growth business. obviously, talked reallocating expenses. net-net, think incremental investment phase next year gating margin upside? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer think that's something obviously ready talk next year now, would say -- reason looking invest summarize again, going up-market legacy app modernization see large workload potentially play ideal database genai apps, future important investment drive long-term growth. quite energized investment that's something high conviction on. brad reback -- analyst that's great. maap program, workload going wind atlas healthy combination ea atlas? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer think early days. would say -- would probably say side atlas ea early days. think introduce search vector search ea product, see on-prem. obviously, people use mongodb ai workload using technology well conjunction mongodb on-prem ai use cases. would say probably going see happen first atlas. brad reback -- analyst great. thanks much. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line jason ader william blair. line open. jason ader -- analyst yeah, thank you. going belabor congratulating michael, fun working best luck. question strength ea. think, dev, represents comment enterprise might rethinking reassessing kind on-prem versus cloud workload placement decision? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer well, think large enterprises, think large enterprise meaningful workload still running on-prem. think belief everything would go cloud probably something really popular good old day zurp. think customer assess investment already place, much judicious run workload think leverage existing investment infrastructure, going so. also bunch reason like regulatory reasons, customer quite moving aggressively cloud. see particularly europe, see lot european bank still running majority workload on-prem. also varies region conversely asia, seeing people much move much aggressively cloud. think really depends industry, geography, personal dynamic what's happening particular account. mean, see large u bank also committed running thing on-prem. really varies. that's feel really good run anywhere strategy give customer optionality. build something run on-prem. choose move cloud, easy mongodb. jason ader -- analyst right. follow-up also investment making strategic sale enterprise. could get little specific investment might be? hiring lot new salespeople? working sis, investing sis? additional detail would helpful. thanks. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. everyone's benefit, identified number accounts, call strategic accounts, think high upside us. seen number account grow quickly deploy right mix resources. necessarily quota-carrying resources. could additional technical sale resources, additional p resources, additional customer service resource better service support accounts. even thing like run education session developer accounts, called either hackathons like call developer day even design review meet development team looking build application, help think would potentially use mongodb build particular app. find many developers, experience mongodb quite limited, engage them, educate show simple easy is. like example, customer today think like use oltp database, search database, maybe vector database, like caching database. integrated mongodb. sudden, customer say, wow, simplify life, simplify back-end infrastructure, build app far quickly much easier manage long-term everything mongodb. really function educating power mongodb really open lot opportunity us. that's doubling down, mix resource really predicated accounts, quota counting resources, whole suite resource bringing table. jason ader -- analyst thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line andrew nowinski well fargo. line open. andrew nowinski -- analyst okay. good afternoon. thank much taking question congrats nice quarter. gave example customer migrated postgres think said issue pg vector function. wondering long customer using postgres decided make change mongo, meaning sort like rebound type customer chose pg -- excuse me, postgres work? frequently seeing type transition? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. can't give specific long using postgres, -- trend seeing business. remember postgres 40-year-old technology. -- beneficiary people lifting shifting type relational databases, oracle, sql server, mysql, et cetera. open-source database. part -- open-source relational database, inherent challenge relational database do. quite inflexible. build schema, hard change schema. hard scale hard distribute data. large data volumes, weird thing like, example, resort off-road storage large data objects, creates performance bottlenecks. again, people default postgres know anything better know relational everyone kind moving relational platforms. that's whole point saying earlier. educate developer flexibility schema, easily horizontally scale rich query language aggregation sophisticated geospatial indexes, productivity gain using document model easy organize data, -- people like, wow, life much easier. want clear, zero-sum game. postgres fail u successful. big market quite excited opportunity, see customer moving postgres coming mongodb. andrew nowinski -- analyst thank you. helpful. maybe quick follow-up. normalize $15 million multiyear deal impact q3, would ea still sequentially q4? thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer given level guidance, trying

think like said, happy new business winning. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line william power baird. line open. brian raferty denyeau -- investor relation there, william? william power -- analyst sorry, yeah. thank you. dev, encouraging comment relational migrator. wonder could touch think driving higher interest here. mean, sound like ai contributing helping, great get color still feel like obviously meaningful long-term opportunity. maybe second part question dev michael, great get framework around professional service investments. way kind think quantification timing that? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. reason excited opportunity go legacy application that, one, seems like there's confluence event happening. one increasing cost tax supporting managing legacy apps going enough. second, many customer regulated industries, regulator calling -- fact running legacy apps systemic risk, longer kick road. third, also longer kick around, vendor going end-of-life, make decision migrate application modern tech stack. fourth, genai predicated data build competitive advantage, need leverage proprietary data, people want access data able easily. that's another reason want modernize. also people built application retiring longer firm, creates risk companies. given that, customer incredibly interested figuring way easily safely securely migrate -- applications. always could help easily move data map schema relational schema document schema. hardest part essentially rewriting application. advent genai, significantly reduce time. one, use genai analyze existing code. two, use genai reverse engineer test test code does. three, use genai build new code user test ensure new code produce result old code. time effort suddenly cut meaningful way that's suddenly creating lot interest customer saying, goodness. already relational app, moving another relational app feel like modernization. so, advantage moving mongodb give much modern platform, much agile, flexible, performant, scalable platform future needs. that's excited. again, early days. run number pilot gone well. process working customer migration process. take time very, complex applications. actually, one thing also mentioned going -- saying go tertiary tier 2 tier 3 application, saying, hey, want look crown jewel apps painful us. that's also exciting. again, take time, committed this, think going drive -- help u drive long-term -- meaningful long-term growth. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, will. last part question professional service investment, really building capacity order meet demand seeing relative opportunity. calling particular gross margin impact that's typically show up. maybe last thing probably obvious, sort underscore reason though arr, right, drive new workloads, additional workload mongodb part migration. time, talked before, hope expect able leverage technology more, least initially medium-term, there's going healthy human/services component that. wanted sort effectively telegraph folks. william power -- analyst that's helpful. thank you. dev c. ittycheria

Welcome to the MongoDB third-quarter fiscal year 2025 conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there'll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your speaker for today, Brian Denyeau. Please go ahead. Brian Raferty Denyeau -- Investor Relations Thank you, Lisa. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today to review MongoDB's third-quarter fiscal 2025 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued after the close of the market today. Joining me the call today are Dev Ittycheria, president and CEO of MongoDB; and Michael Gordon, MongoDB's COO and CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our market and future growth opportunities, our expectations for the macroeconomic environment in fiscal 2025 and the impact of AI, the benefits of our product platform, our competitive landscape, customer behaviors, our financial guidance, and our planned investments in growth opportunities in AI. These statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including the results of operations and financial condition that cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. For a discussion of the material risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please refer to the risks described in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 31st, 2024 that we filed with the SEC on August 30th, 2024. Any forward-looking statements made on this call reflect our views only as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them except as required by law. Additionally, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures on this conference call. Please refer to the tables in our earnings release in the Investor Relations portion of our website for a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dev. Dev? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we had a strong quarter of new business and executed well against our large market opportunity. Let's begin by reviewing our third quarter results before giving you a broader company update. We generated revenue of $529 million, a 22% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew 26% year-over-year, representing 68% of total revenue. We generated non-GAAP operating income of $101 million for a 19% non-GAAP operating margin and we ended the quarter with over 52,600 customers. Overall, we were pleased with our performance in the third quarter. We had a strong new business quarter and we're happy with our new workload acquisition on Atlas. Our non-Atlas business significantly exceeded expectations in part because we benefited from a few large multi-year deals as customers continue to value our run anywhere strategy and want to build a deeper longer-term relationship with MongoDB. Atlas consumption was slightly better than expected in a macro-environment that we would characterize as largely consistent with what we saw in the first half of the year. Michael will cover consumption trends in more detail. Retention rates remained strong in Q3, demonstrating the mission criticality of our platform. On our Q1 earnings call, we shared with you the three major strategic initiatives that we believe will enable us to maximize our long-term opportunity. I want to give you an update on the progress we're making on those initiatives. First, we are increasing our investment in the enterprise channel since we see the strongest returns in this part of the market. Specifically, we're expanding our strategic account program going to next year, as we see more accounts that will benefit from incremental investment. In addition, we're investing time and resources to educate developers in large enterprise accounts and uplevel their MongoDB skills. These organizations have thousands of developers and as we penetrate them more deeply, we encounter developers who have historically only built SQL applications and simply do not know how to use MongoDB to its full potential. In our experience, educating these developers on the benefits of MongoDB drives significant incremental adoption of our platform. To fund these up-market investments, we are reallocating a portion of our mid-market investments. The mid-market remains an attractive opportunity for us, but we believe that prioritizing investment up-market will deliver strong returns in the current environment. We also believe there are additional ways to serve the mid-market more efficiently through our self-serve channel and other scaled technology-enabled sales and customer service motions. Second, we are optimistic about the opportunity to accelerate legacy app modernization using AI and are investing more in this area. As you recall, we ran a few successful pilots earlier this year, demonstrating that AI tooling combined with professional services and our relational migrator product can significantly reduce the time, cost, and risk of migrating legacy applications onto MongoDB. While it's early days, we have observed a more than 50% reduction in the cost to modernize. On the back of these strong early results, additional customer interest is exceeding our expectations. Large enterprises in every industry and geography are experiencing acute pain from their legacy infrastructure and are eager for more agile, performant, and cost-effective solutions. Not only are customers excited to engage with us, they also want to focus on some of the most important applications in their enterprise, further demonstrating the level of interest and size of the long-term opportunity. As relational applications encompass a wide variety of database types, programming languages, versions, and other customer-specific variables, we expect modernization projects to continue to include meaningful service engagements in the short and medium term. Consequently, we're increasing our professional services delivery capabilities, both directly and through partners. In the long run, we expect to automate and simplify large parts of the modernization process. To that end, we are leveraging the learnings from early service engagement to develop new tools to accelerate future modernization efforts. Although it's early days and scaling our legacy app modernization capabilities will take time, we have increased conviction that this motion will significantly add to our growth in the long term. Third, we are investing to capitalize on our inherent technical advantages as a key component of the emerging AI tech stack. As a reminder, MongoDB is uniquely equipped to query rich and complex data structures typical of AI applications. The ability of a database to query rich and complex data structures is crucial because AI applications often rely on highly detailed, interrelated, and nuanced data to make accurate predictions and decisions. For example, a recommendation system doesn't just analyze a single customer's purchase but also considers their browsing history, peer group behavior, and product categories requiring a database that can query and interlink these complex data structures. In addition, MongoDB's architecture unifies source data, metadata, operational data, and vector data in an all-in-one platform, updating the need for multiple database systems and complex back-end architectures. This enables a more compelling developer experience than any other alternative. From what we see in the AI market today, most customers are still in the experimental stage as they work to understand the effectiveness of the underlying tech stack and build early proof-of-concept applications. However, we are seeing an increasing number of AI apps in production. Today, we have thousands of AI apps on our platform. What we don't yet see is many of these apps actually achieving meaningful product market fit and therefore significant traction. In fact, as you take a step back and look at the entire universe of AI apps, a very small percentage of them have achieved the type of scale that we commonly see with enterprise-specific applications. We do have some AI apps that are growing quickly, including one that is already a seven-figure workload that has grown 10 times since the beginning of the year. Similar to prior platform shifts as the usefulness of AI tech improves and becomes more cost-effective, we will see the emergence of many more AI apps that do nail product market fit, but it's difficult to predict when that will happen more broadly. We remain confident that we will capture our fair share of these successful AI applications as we see that our platform is popular with developers building more sophisticated AI use cases. We continue investing in our product capabilities, including enterprise-grade Atlas Vector Search functionality to build on this momentum and even better position MongoDB to capture the AI opportunity. In addition, as previously announced, we are bringing search and vector service to our community and EA offerings, leveraging our run anywhere competitive advantage in the world of AI. Finally, we are expanding our MongoDB AI applications program or MAAP, which helps enterprise customers build and bring AI applications into production by providing them with reference architectures, integrations with leading tech providers, and coordinated services and support. Last week, we announced a new code of partners including McKinsey, Confluent, Capgemini, and Unstructured, as well as the collaboration with Meta to enable developers to build AI-enriched applications on MongoDB using Llama. Next, I'd like to provide you with a brief product update. At our dot local developer conference in London in October, we announced the general availability of MongoDB 8.0, the fastest and most performant version of MongoDB ever. MongoDB 8.0 performs 20% to 60% better against common industry benchmarks compared to our prior version and is built to exceed our customers' most stringent security, resiliency, availability, and performance requirements. To best serve our customers, we regularly review and reprioritize investments in our product portfolio to ensure we're allocating our resources to products with the highest demand from our customers. And to do that, we also deprecate products that are not showing results we desired. Consequently, we made the decision to consolidate our Atlas serverless offerings with our smallest dedicated tiers to create Atlas Flex customers, a new offering with a simpler architecture that provides the elasticity features akin to serverless. We will begin migrating effective customers to the single, simple, entry-level solution in Q4. We also decided to deprecate Atlas DeviceSync and other capabilities not widely adopted in order to focus our engineering resources on the core platform. While these reprioritization decisions are not made lightly, they allow us to deliver the most value to the largest number of customers, reinforcing our commitment to being the best modern database and helping us to grow faster. Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the adoption trends of MongoDB across our customer base. Customers across industries and around the world are running mission-critical projects in MongoDB Atlas, leveraging the full power of our developer data platform, including Financial Times, CarGurus, and Victoria's Secret. As part of the digital transformation journey, global specialty retailer Victoria's Secret & Company migrated its e-commerce platform to MongoDB Atlas. As a fully managed platform, MongoDB Atlas allowed the company to simplify its architecture and improve performance, supporting the retailer to provide a resilient, secure, and fast web and mobile e-commerce experience for their millions of customers around the world. Allianz, Alphamad, Swiss Post, and Paylocity are turning to MongoDB to modernize applications. Paylocity, a leading provider of cloud-based payroll and human capital management software, selected MongoDB to power proprietary application aimed at fostering employee connections and engagement. When traffic increased and the original SQL-based solution was unable to keep up with the required performance metrics, Paylocity migrated to MongoDB Atlas to take advantage of the flexible schema architecture, performance, and scalability. MongoDB costs five times less than the previous SQL database solution and the company's developers can now create an application within minutes, something that used to take weeks. Mature companies and start-ups alike are using MongoDB to help deliver the next wave of AI-powered application to customers, including NerdWallet, Cisco, and Tealbook. Tealbook, a supplier intelligence platform, migrated from Postgres, pgvector, and ElasticSearch to MongoDB to eliminate technical debt and consolidate their tech stack. The company experienced workload isolation and scalability issues in pgvector and were concerned with the search index inconsistencies, which were all resolved with the migration to MongoDB. With Atlas Vector search and dedicated search nodes, Tealbook has realized improved cost-efficiency and increased scalability for the supplier data platform, an application that uses GenAI to collect, verify, and enrich supplier data across various sources. In summary, we had a healthy Q3 with both Atlas and EA exceeding expectations. We saw a strong new business quarter and we remain confident in our ability to become an increasing strategic provider in our large and growing market. Looking forward, we see a great opportunity to grow our adoption in the enterprise through new workloads, modernizing legacy applications, and winning the next generation of AI-powered applications. I would like to finish by providing an update on our senior leadership. First, as we announced early in the press release, after nearly 10 years, Michael Gordon has made the decision to leave MongoDB. Michael has been instrumental in MongoDB's success over the past decade, leading our successful IPO, helping us grow our revenue nearly 50-fold, and scaling -- and successfully scaling our business model to generate meaningful operating leverage. He has been a trusted advisor and business partner to the Board and me over the years and also has become a personal friend. Michael is excited to take a well-deserved break. We have commenced the search for Michael's replacement and will be evaluating both internal and external candidates. One of Michael's proudest compliments -- accomplishments has been building a world-class finance team under his leadership, and I'm confident that we will not miss a beat during this transition. Michael will continue to serve as CFO through January 31st to help us finish the fiscal year and then will transition to an Advisor to the company to ensure a seamless process. If we have not named Michael's successor by fiscal year-end, Serge Tanjga, SVP of Finance, will serve as Interim CFO, beginning on February 1st. Second, we are promoting Cedric Pech, currently our chief revenue officer to the newly created role of president worldwide field operations. In this new position, Cedric will oversee all our field-based customer-facing and go-to-market enablement teams, including professional services. We believe this org structure will best enable us to execute on some of the key strategic initiatives I discussed earlier, in particular, our increased focus on up-market and the app monetization opportunity. I would like to congratulate Cedric on this well-deserved promotion. With that, let me turn the call over to Michael. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Dev, and thanks for the kind words and our incredible partnership over the past decade. The past 10 years have been the most rewarding in my professional career and I'm extremely proud of what we've achieved together and of course, to the whole MongoDB team. With as much success as we had, I still believe that MongoDB is in the early stages of realizing its full potential as it continues to take share in one of the largest markets in software. Now, turning to the results for the quarter. I'll begin with a detailed review of our third-quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025. First, I'll start with our third quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $529.4 million, up 22% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance. Shifting to our product mix, Atlas grew 26% in the quarter compared to the previous year and now represents 68% of total revenue compared to 66% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and 71% last quarter. We recognized Atlas revenue primarily based on customer consumption of our platform and that consumption is closely tied to end user activity of their applications. Let me provide some context on Atlas consumption in the quarter. In Q3, consumption was slightly ahead of our expectations. This year's Q3 seasonal improvement was more muted than in years past as expected. On a year-over-year basis, consumption growth remains below that of prior year period. Turning to non-Atlas revenue. Non-Atlas came in significantly ahead of our expectations. As Dev mentioned, EA new business was strong, and we continue to have success selling incremental workloads into our existing customer base. In addition, our Q3 non-Atlas revenue benefited from a few large multi-year deals. As you know, due to ASC 606, we recognized the entire term license component of a multi-year contract at the start of that contract. Compared to Q3 of last year, the multi-year license component of non-Atlas revenues was over $15 million higher. Turning to customer growth. During the third quarter, we grew our customer base by approximately 1,900 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 52,600, which is up from over 46,400 in the year-ago period. Of our total customer count, over 7,400 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 6,900 in the year-ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven primarily by Atlas, which had over 51,100 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 44,900 in the year-ago period. It is important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers adding their first Atlas workload. Continuing on, in Q3, our net ARR expansion rate was approximately 120%. We ended the quarter with 2,314 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, up from $1,972 in the year-ago period. Moving down the income statement, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the third quarter was $405.7 million, representing a gross margin of 77%, which is flat versus the year-ago period. Our income from operations was $101.5 million or 19% operating margin for the third quarter compared to an 18% operating margin in the year-ago period. The primary reason for more favorable operating income results versus guidance is our revenue outperformance, including the very high margin multi-year license revenue benefit. Net income in the third quarter was $98.1 million or $1.16 per share, based on 84.2 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a net income of $79.1 million or $0.96 per share on 83.7 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding in the year-ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the third quarter with $2.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $37.4 million. After taking into consideration approximately $2.9 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was $34.6 million in the quarter. This compares to free cash flow of $35 million in the year-ago period. In Q3, we did not incur capital expenditures to purchase IPV4 addresses as we previously expected, but we did start making those purchases in November and still expect a total outlay of $20 million to $25 million this fiscal year as we previously communicated. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $515 million to $519 million. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $55 million to $58 million and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.65 based on 84.9 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. For the full-fiscal year 2025, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.973 billion to $1.977 billion, non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $242 million to $245 million, and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $3.01 to $3.03 based on 84 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. Note that the non-GAAP net income per share guidance for the fourth-quarter and full-fiscal year 2025 includes a non-GAAP tax provision of approximately 20%. I'll now provide some more context around our updated guidance. First, in terms of Atlas consumption, we expect to see a typical seasonal slowdown in Q4, driven by underlying application usage moderating during the holiday season. Second, since Atlas consumption remained lower on a year-over-year basis in Q3, we expect to see continued deceleration of Atlas year-over-year growth in Q4. Third, we expect to see a sequential decline in non-Atlas revenue in Q4, which is contrary to our normal pattern. The reason for this is that we experienced a significant additional benefit from multi-year deals in Q3, which we do not expect to recur in Q4. In addition, I want to provide some incremental color on some of our recent product and -- how some of our recent product and go-to-market changes will impact the growth of our reported customer count going forward. First, as Dev explained, we are reallocating a portion of our go-to-market resources from the mid-market to the enterprise channel. As a result, we expect to see significantly fewer mid-market direct sales customer net additions and as a result, slower direct sales customer growth going forward. We believe this reallocation of investment dollars will drive higher revenue growth over time. So, it's a trade-off that makes sense. Second, as we introduce Atlas Flex clusters in Q4 and automatically migrate customers in Q1, we expect to see a one-time negative impact to our customer count since we have approximately 4,000 serverless customers who are very low spending and we do not expect them to transition over to Flex. These customers have a negligible impact on our revenue but will impact our reported customer count. To summarize, we're pleased with our third quarter results and especially our ability to win new business. We have a small share in one of the largest and fastest-growing markets in all of software with a number of secular tailwinds, including AI at our back. We'll continue investing judiciously and focusing on our execution to capture this long-term opportunity. With that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator? Questions & Answers: Operator [Operator instructions] Our first question for the day will be coming from Sanjit Singh of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Thank you for taking the questions and congrats, Michael, on outstanding career. You had an absolutely fantastic run at MongoDB. I'm excited to see what you do next, or excited if you just take a breather. So congrats, Michael. I guess to take the question -- to start off with the questions, when we look at what Atlas has been doing in the past two quarters, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think consumption is coming in at least modestly ahead of your expectations. Relative to what we've seen at the beginning of the year, what sort of -- is it a function of sales execution? Is it a function of the end-user activity sort of improving? What's driving at least the improvement in Atlas consumption in the past two quarters? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So a few different things. So I think if you look at our outlook at the beginning of the year, we had indicated that we thought we would see stable Atlas growth from a consumption standpoint. What we've seen and what we've talked about is -- we've actually seen lower year-over-year growth based on the underlying consumption. And so -- and that's incorporated into our Q4 guide. We have seen the Q3 and Q4 be -- sorry, Q2 and Q3, excuse me, be better than our expectations, but it's still down on a year-over-year basis. And so I want to make sure that we're not sort of confusing the comparative set of year-over-year versus relative to our expectations. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Understood. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer And the core of it, Sanjit, to your question is really the underlying usage of the applications. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Yeah, that makes total sense. And then, Dev, I have to ask you the AI agent question. In terms of an AI agent needing more context, it has going to have a set of tools to take its actions. What does it mean for MongoDB as an operational data store as customers start to roll out more agentic applications? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, just to talk about agents, I think when you think about agents, there's jobs, there's -- sorry, there's a job, there's projects and then there's task. Right now, the agents that are being rolled out are really focused on task like say something from Sierra or some other companies are rolling out agents. But you're right, what they deemed to do is to deal with being able to create a rich and complex data structures. Now why is this important for AI is that AI models don't just look at isolated data points, but they need to understand relationships, hierarchies, and patterns within the data. They need to be able to essentially get real-time insights. For example, if you have a chatbot where someone is querying, a customer is kind of trying to get some update on the order they placed five minutes ago because they may have not gotten any confirmation, your chatbot needs to be able to deal with real-time information. You need to be able to deal with basically handling very advanced use cases, understanding like, to do things like fraud detection to understand behaviors of supply chains, you need to understand intricate data relationships. All these things are consistent with MongoDB offers. And so we believe that at the end of the day, we are well-positioned to handle this. And the other thing that I would say is that we've embedded in a very natural way of search and vector search. So we're just not an OLTP database, we do tech search and vector search. That's all one experience and no other platform offers that, and we think we have a real advantage. And so we're integrated with the leading AI frameworks and platforms. We have enterprise-grade security and compliance, and customers can run us anywhere, either on 118 cloud regions or on-prem, and that again is a huge differentiator for us. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Awesome. Appreciate the thoughts, Dev. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Sanjit. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Taylor -- Tyler Radke of Citi. Your line is open. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Hi, thank you very much for taking the question. And, Michael, all the best, and congratulations on 10 years. Going back to the sales execution, I mean, one of the things that you talked about earlier this year was some challenges just in terms of the recently acquired workloads ramping. And I think a lot of those were from the past fiscal year. So curious how the quality of workload acquisition has trended this year. And as you think about the ramp in consumption potential into next year, how does that sort of look versus this time a year ago? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Maybe I'll just talk about what we're doing and the changes we made and then Michael can talk a little bit about the consumption trends. So, we did make some changes at the beginning of the year, and we really wanted to focus on both the volume and the quality of the workloads and there were some slight adjustments that we made. We think those changes are having a reasonable positive impact. Again, it's too early to declare victory because these workloads usually start small and grow over time, but we're really pleased with the results we're seeing so far. And -- but again, it's early days. And obviously, we'll know about the fiscal '25 workloads as we go into fiscal '26. But so far, so good. Michael, on consumption? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, just a couple of things, and thanks, Tyler. The fiscal '24 cohorts that we called out earlier, that slower growth does continue. They've been in line with our revised expectations. We made some changes that we talked about at the -- earlier in the year that should affect the fiscal '25 cohorts, but it's just too early to tell. On those, we need a few more quarters of data before you can really see if we're -- how we're seeing those behave differently. I will say we've talked about the new business environment and our success in new business. We have been pleased with that, but that just shows kind of the initial piece, and we need to see how they grow and how those cohorts evolve. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Great. Thanks. And follow-up on the EA side, you talked about the outsized strength in non-Atlas business this quarter. Maybe if you could unpack like the relative upside that was driven by simply duration versus new business. I know you called out the duration impact year-over-year, but are -- do you feel like this was sort of a one-off or do you feel like maybe some of your bigger customers are indexing more toward EA and how does that impact the way you think about the product and introducing things like vector search and stream processing onto the on-prem product? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, thank you. So overall, we continue to find the EA product resonate with customers. It's an important part of the run anywhere strategy and we've continued to see success with that and people wanting to increase their investment in MongoDB. There's always been a multiyear component and we continue to see that. We talked about that at the beginning of the year as to how fiscal '24 had an abnormally high amount of multi-year benefit and therefore, we were anticipating that being a headwind and we quantified that in roughly the $40 million range. What we talked about on this call earlier is we saw from a few large accounts, a surprising amount of multiyear that positively benefited Q3 at a little more than $15 million in revenue compared to what we saw Q3 a year ago. So, not as much of a headwind as we had been expecting. Obviously, with the 606 dynamics, some of these things, especially for a large deal can be kind of meaty and chunky and lumpy, which is why we try and call it out and sort of help people understand, but there's a pretty healthy kind of baseline flow, not just of EA, but also of multiyear. And when we see spikes, we just try and call it out for you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I just want to add, Tyler, that we are investing in our what we call our EA business. First, we're starting by investing with search and vector search and a community product. That does a couple of things for us. One, whenever anyone starts with MongoDB with the open-source product, they immediately get all the benefits of that complete highly integrated platform. Two, those capabilities will then migrate to EA. So, EA for us is an investment strategy. We definitely see lots of large customers who are very, very committed to running workloads on-prem. We even see some customers want to run to run AI workloads on-prem. So, the optionality they get by using MongoDB to not just be on-prem and the cloud, but also cross-cloud is a very compelling one. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Brad Reback of Stifel. Your line is open. Brad Reback -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. And, Michael, best of luck. It's been a great run. Dev, you started the call talking about a bunch of investments, which are great given the growth of the business. And obviously, you talked about reallocating some expenses. But net-net, should we think about this incremental investment phase next year as gating margin upside? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think that's something that we obviously are not ready to talk about next year just now, but I would say that we -- the reason we're looking to invest and just to summarize again, going up-market on legacy app modernization where we see very large workloads potentially at play and being the ideal database for GenAI apps, which is the future as important investments to drive long-term growth. And we're quite energized by those investments and that's something that we have high conviction on. Brad Reback -- Analyst That's great. And then on the MAAP program, are most of those workloads going to wind up in Atlas or will that be a healthy combination of EA and Atlas? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think it's again early days. I would say -- I would probably say more on the side of Atlas and EA in the early days. I think once we introduce a search and vector search into the EA product, you'll see more of that on-prem. Obviously, people can use MongoDB for AI workloads using other technologies as well in conjunction with MongoDB for on-prem AI use cases. But I would say you're probably going to see that happen first in Atlas. Brad Reback -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Jason Ader of William Blair. Your line is open. Jason Ader -- Analyst Yeah, thank you. I'm not going to belabor congratulating Michael, but it has been it has been fun working with you and best of luck. The question I had is on the strength in EA. Do you think, Dev, it represents a comment on how enterprises might be rethinking or reassessing the kind of on-prem versus cloud workload placement decision? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Well, when I think about large enterprises, I think large enterprises have meaningful workloads that are still running on-prem. I think the belief that everything would go to the cloud was probably something that was really popular in the good old days of Zurp. But I think now as customers assess their investments that they already have in place, they're being much more judicious about where they run those workloads and if they think they can leverage their existing investments in their own infrastructure, then they're going to do so. Also for a bunch of other reasons like regulatory reasons, some customers are quite not moving as aggressively to the cloud. We see that in particularly in Europe, where we see a lot of the European banks still running majority of the workloads on-prem. So it also varies by region where conversely in Asia, we're seeing people much move much more aggressively to the cloud. So I think it really depends on industry, on geography, and on the personal dynamics of what's happening in that particular account. I mean, we see some large US banks are also very committed to running things on-prem. So it really varies. And that's why we feel really good about our run anywhere strategy because it gives customer optionality. They can build something and run on-prem. And if and when they choose to move to the cloud, it's very easy to do so with MongoDB. Jason Ader -- Analyst All right. And then just as a follow-up also on the investments you're making in strategic sales and enterprise. Could you just get a little more specific on what those investments might be? Is it hiring a lot of new salespeople? Is it working more with SIs, investing more in SIs? Any additional detail would be helpful. Thanks. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So just for everyone's benefit, we've identified a number of accounts, which we call strategic accounts, which we think that have high upside for us. We've seen a number of accounts that grow very quickly when we deploy the right mix of resources. Now they're all not necessarily quota-carrying resources. They could be additional technical sales resources, additional PS resources, additional customer service resources to better service and support those accounts. We even do things like run education sessions for developers of the accounts, they're called either hackathons or like what we call developer days or even design reviews where we'll meet with our development teams who are looking to build an application, help them think about how they would potentially use MongoDB to build that particular app. And what we find is that because many of these developers, the experience with MongoDB is quite limited, the more we can engage with them, the more we can educate them and the more we can show them how simple and easy it is. Like for example, most customers today think like they have to use an OLTP database, then a search database, maybe a vector database, and then like a caching database. And all that is integrated in MongoDB. So all of a sudden, customers can say, wow, I can simplify my life, simplify my back-end infrastructure, build this app far more quickly and it will be much more easier to manage long-term if I do everything on MongoDB. And it's really a function of just educating them on the power of MongoDB that really opens up a lot of opportunities for us. So that's why we're doubling down, and the mix of resources is really predicated on the accounts, but it's not just quota counting resources, it's the whole suite of resources that we're bringing to the table. Jason Ader -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Andrew Nowinski of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Okay. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking the question and congrats on a nice quarter. You gave an example of a customer that migrated off Postgres and I think you said they had issues with their PG vector function. I was wondering how long was that customer using Postgres before they decided to make a change to Mongo, meaning was this some sort of like a rebound type customer where they chose PG -- or excuse me, Postgres and it didn't work? And then how frequently are you seeing this type of transition? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So I can't give you the specifics on how long they were using Postgres, but this is not -- this is a trend that we're seeing in our business. You have to remember Postgres is a 40-year-old technology. It's -- and they have been the beneficiary of people lifting and shifting from other types of relational databases, Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, et cetera. And they're an open-source database. And but as part -- because they're an open-source and relational database, they have the same inherent challenges all relational databases do. They're quite inflexible. So once you build a schema, it's very hard to change the schema. It's hard to scale and hard to distribute data. And if you have large data volumes, you have to do weird things like, for example, resort to off-road storage for large data objects, which creates performance bottlenecks. And so again, people default to Postgres if they don't know anything better because all they know is relational and everyone is kind of moving off those other relational platforms. And that's the whole point I was saying earlier. Once we educate developers on the flexibility of schema, how easily or horizontally scale the rich query language where you can do aggregations and do sophisticated geospatial indexes, the productivity gains by using the document model and how easy is to organize data, it's -- people are just like, wow, life is so much easier. Now I want to be clear, this is not a zero-sum game. Postgres does not have to fail for us to be successful. It's a big market and we're quite excited about the opportunity, but we do see customers moving off Postgres and coming to MongoDB. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Thank you. That was very helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up. If we normalize the $15 million multiyear deal impact you had in Q3, would EA still be down sequentially in Q4? Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer We haven't given that level of guidance, but just trying to help you understand in the context of the full-year numbers and the headwind that we talked about at the beginning of the year, just given the strength that we saw in Q3. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Got it. Thanks. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. The next question will be coming from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst Hey, thank you. And if you think about the EA strength this quarter, Michael, you'd kind of give us a little bit there. Like how should we think about renewal -- the renewal situation renewal pool coming up like or that you had in Q3, coming up in Q4, et cetera, as well and then like what does it mean in terms of upsell, cross-sell opportunity as people think about starting AI projects by self-serve, as you kind of mentioned earlier on the call? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So I think about -- if you think about EA for Q4, it tends to be a large renewal quarter, but what we're talking about in terms of the guide is because we had such strength in multiyear, that's where we would expect to see our EA down sequentially, which is not typically our pattern, which is why we called it out. In terms of AI workloads and some of those other things, I think it's early to tell and obviously, we'll continue to evolve and assess our view when we get to the full-year guide in March. And then we'll also have an updated view on how the cohorts are behaving and sort of how multiyear played out. But I think in terms of Q4, the comments that I made earlier hopefully will help. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst Yeah. Okay, perfect. And then the -- and can you talk a little bit about like obviously, there's a debate of like which database will be the persistent layer if you do AI projects, et cetera. What do you see from the big hyperscalers in terms of working with you guys and partnerships? We obviously just have AWS kind of summit, et-cetera. Can you speak a little bit like how your relationship with those big guys is evolving around this? And Michael, All the best in case I don't talk to you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, I'll start with the partnerships first, like our -- with AWS, as you said, they just had their re:Invent show last week. Our -- it remains very, very strong. We've closed a ton of deals this past quarter. Some of them very, very large deals. We're doing integrations to some of the new products like Q and Bedrock and the engagement in the field has been really strong. On Azure, I think we -- as I've shared in the past, we start-off with a little bit of a slow start, but in the words of the person who runs their partner leadership, the Azure MongoDB relationship has never been stronger. We've closed a large number of deals. We're part of what's called the Azure native IC service program and have a bunch of deep integrations with Azure, including Fabric, Power BI, Visual Studio, Semantic Kernel, and Azure OpenAI Studio. And we're also one of Azure's largest marketplace partners. And GCP does -- we have actually seen some uptick in terms of co-sales that we've done this past quarter and GCP made some comp changes where they -- that were favorable to working with MongoDB that we saw some results in the field, and we're focused on closing on -- closing a handful of large deals with GCP in Q4. So in general, I would say, things are going quite well. And then in terms of, I guess, implying your question was like the hyperscalers and are they potentially bundling things along with their AI offerings? I mean, candidly, since day one, the hyperscalers have been bundling their database offerings with every offering that they have and that's been their predominant strategy. And we've -- I think we've executed well against strategy because databases are not like a by-the-way decision. It's an important decision. And I think the hyperscalers are seeing our performance and realize it's better to partner with us. And as I said, customers understand the importance of the data layer, especially for AI applications. And so the partnership across all three hyperscalers is strong. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst OK, perfect. Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Raimo. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. The next question will be coming from the line of Brad Sills of Bank of America. Your line is open. Brad Sills -- Analyst Great. Thank you so much, and congratulations, Michael, on your next move. I wanted to ask about new workloads here on vector search, stream processing, relational migrator. Is there any one of those three that's ramping faster than maybe you expected? Just a little bit of color on how those new workload types are ramping. Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I'll kind of give you just a rundown of some of the -- I mean, essentially you're asking about the new products, like our -- on search, we introduced a new capability called Atlas search nodes, which where you can asymmetrically scale your search nodes because if you have a search-intensive use case, you don't have to scale all your nodes because they have become quite expensive. And we've seen that this kind of groundbreaking capability really well received. The demand is quite high and because customers like they can tune the configuration to the unique needs of their search requirements. One of the world's largest banks is using Atlas Search to provide like a Google-like search experience on payments data for massive corporate customers. So this is a customer-facing application and so performance, and scalability are critical. A leading provider of AI-powered accounting software uses Atlas Search to power its invoice analytics future, which allows end users and finance teams to perform ad-hoc analysis and easily find past-due invoices and voices that contain errors. So that search -- on vector search, it -- again, and it's been our kind of our first full-year since going generally available. And the product uptake has been actually very, very high. In Q3, we released quantization for Atlas Vector Search, which reduces the memory requirements by up to 96%, allowing us to support larger vector workloads with vastly improved price performance. For example, a multinational news organization created a GenAI powered tool designed to help producers and journalists efficiently search, summarize, and verify information from vast and varied data sources. A leading security firm is using Atlas Vector Search to fight AI fraud and a leading global media company replaced elastic search with hybrid search and vector search use case for a user recommendation engine that's built to suggest -- that's built in to suggest articles to end users. And so that's super exciting to see as well. We're also seeing a lot of interest in our streaming product, demand is very high. We just rolled it out to another hyperscaler, and customers are commenting on that the use cases of being able to embed stream processing with MongoDB makes our life so much easier. So overall, we're quite pleased with the progress we're making on the new products. And as I said before, natively bundling all these capabilities really reduces or eliminates the need for customers to have to bolt on a bunch of different technologies to solve the same problem, saving them a lot of time, money, cost, and risk. Brad Sills -- Analyst That's really exciting. Thanks, Dev. And then I wanted to ask a question around Cedric's appointment. Any focus that may be different here under his leadership that we should be thinking about going forward? Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer No, Cedric has been our CRO for, gosh, now like I think like five, six years, and he -- I was the Interim CRO for about three quarters until he took over when we last made a change and this is really an expansion of his responsibilities. I've known Cedric for a long time. He and I have worked with at multiple different companies. I think I have a good barometer for understanding sales leadership. There's a number of sales leaders who worked at other top-tier software companies who used to work for me or with me. And so I'm super-excited by the role Cedric is going to take and then we're also making some changes under Cedric to better align the different organizations so that we can more tightly work together on going up-market, on app monetization and positioning ourselves well to be the ideal database for GenAI apps. Brad Sills -- Analyst Super exciting. Thanks, Dev. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Brad. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question, please. Our next question will be coming from the line of Mike Cikos of Needham and Company. Your line is open. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Hey guys, thanks for taking the question here. I just wanted to come back to the consumption growth being slightly better than expectations again for the second quarter in a row now. And apologies if I missed it, but this improvement that we're seeing, is this across all vintages and geographies or is it potentially more concentrated in scope? Just trying to get a better understanding of what's seeking place out there and what's embedded in the guide. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. No, I would describe it as broad-based, Mike. And obviously, we're pleased to see it and we're continuing monitoring and slicing and dicing it in different ways. And as we have information or insights to you, we'll share it. And without trying to throw a whole bunch of cold water on our mind, it was slightly better, or a step-function changed better, but good to see. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Terrific. And maybe for a quick follow-up for Dev. I think it builds off maybe Tyler's question at the top of the Q&A, but you had cited that some customers are thinking about their workloads more holistically and even looking to run AI workloads on-prem. How much of that do you think is just a function of customers are still trying to figure out how to optimize for latency and cost or is this more a demonstration of we really are in the early phases of the exploratory phase versus going into production? Is there any way to coarse that out or is the two not necessarily connected? Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer No, I think it's kind of a little bit of both. I think you have some customers who are very committed to running a big part of the estate on-prem. So by definition, then if they're going to build an AI workload, it has to be run on-prem, which means that they also need access to GPUs and they're doing that. And then other customers are leveraging basically renting GPUs from the cloud providers and building their own AI workloads. I do think we're in the very, very early days. They're still learning, experimenting. More-and-more apps are entering production. And as I said on the prepared remarks, we have thousands of workload -- AI workloads running on MongoDB, but a very small percentage of them have demonstrated meaningful product market fit. And so the initial traction is kind of still small. But I think as people get more sophisticated with AI, as the AI technology matures and becomes more and more useful, I think applications will -- you'll start seeing these applications take-off. I kind of chuckled that today I see more senior leaders bragging about the chips they're using versus the apps they're building. So it just tells you that we're still in the very, very early days of this big platform shift. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Great point. Thank you again, guys. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Mike. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Eric Heath of KeyBanc. Your line is open. Eric Heath -- Analyst Hi, thanks for taking the question. Dev, Michael, it sounds like the takeaway from the call is a greater focus on EA and on enterprise. So should we structurally rethink the EA business differently and think of this more as a healthy double-digit growth business going forward for the foreseeable future? And then if I could just ask a follow-up question separate to that. But Michael, I understand that it's still early to identify the fiscal '25 cohort of workloads, but just curious at a high-level if they look and feel like of higher quality than the fiscal '24 cohort of workflow. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Do you want to take on the first one in terms of EA... Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, I mean, I would say, I mean, we are very committed to our run anywhere strategy. And as I said, we are first investing in community where for many customers is the first way they experience MongoDB. And we want them to have the full experience of integrating search and Vector search into our core product. And so they can out of the gate really start building applications. That will then transition to building those capabilities into EA. So, we are clearly investing in the EA product. But Atlas is still a big, big part of our business and a big, big part of our growth engine and we typically launch new features on Atlas and because of the capabilities we already have, the fact it's multi-cloud makes it a very, very compelling offering for many customers. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. And I think in terms of the workloads, I do think it's early. Just as a reminder for folks, they tend to start small, although grow quickly. I think the only other thing that I can add is, we've been pretty consistent and that we've been pleased with the new business that we've done. But we need some time to let the cohorts play out as we track them. But I think like I said, we've been happy with the new business that we were winning. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of William Power of Baird. Your line is open. Brian Raferty Denyeau -- Investor Relations You there, William? William Power -- Analyst Sorry, yeah. Thank you. Dev, you had some encouraging comments on relational migrator. I wonder if you could just touch on what you think is driving the higher interest here. I mean, it sounds like AI is contributing and helping, but it'd be great to get some more color there because that still feels like obviously a meaningful long-term opportunity. And then maybe the second part of the question for Dev or Michael, just be great to get any other framework around the professional services investments. Any way to kind of think about quantification and timing of that? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So the reason we're so excited about the opportunity to go after legacy applications is that, one, it seems like there's a confluence of events happening. One is that the increasing cost and tax of supporting and managing these legacy apps are just going up enough. Second, for many customers who are in regulated industries, the regulators are calling their -- the fact that they're running on these legacy apps with systemic risk, so they can no longer kick the can down the road. Third, also because they no longer can kick the can around, some vendors are going end-of-life, so they have to make a decision to migrate those applications to a more modern tech stack. Fourth, because GenAI is so predicated on data and to build a competitive advantage, you need to leverage your proprietary data, people want to access that data and be able to do so easily. And so that's another reason for them to want to modernize. And then you also have people who built those applications who are retiring or just no longer in the firm, so it just creates more and more risk for the companies. Given all that, customers are incredibly interested in figuring out a way to easily and safely and securely migrate those -- off those applications. And we always could help them very easily move the data and map the schema from a relational schema to a document schema. The hardest part was essentially rewriting the application. Now with the advent of GenAI, you can now significantly reduce the time. One, you can use GenAI to analyze existing code. Two, you can use GenAI to reverse engineer tests to test what the code does. And then three, you can use GenAI to build new code and then users test it to ensure that the new code produces the same results as the old code. And so all that time and effort is suddenly cut in a meaningful way and that's suddenly creating a lot of interest from customers saying, my goodness. And if you're already on a relational app, moving to another relational app doesn't feel like modernization. So, the other advantage is that moving to MongoDB gives them a much more modern platform, a much more agile, flexible, performant, and scalable platform for their future needs. And that's why we're so excited. Again, it's early days. We've run a number of pilots that have gone well. We're in the process of working with some customers now in the migration process. This will take time because these are very, very complex applications. And actually, one thing I also mentioned was that they're not just going after -- saying go after some tertiary Tier 2 or Tier 3 application, they're saying, hey, we want you to look at some of our crown jewels because these are the apps that are most painful for us. So that's also very exciting. But again, this will take time, but we're very committed to this, and we think this is going to drive -- help us drive long-term -- meaningful long-term growth. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, Will. And to the last part of your question on the professional services investment, we're really building out that capacity in order to meet the demand that we're seeing relative to the opportunity. We're calling it in particular because it has a gross margin impact because that's where that will typically show up. And then maybe the last thing and it's probably obvious, but just to sort of underscore it is the reason we're doing this though is for the ARR, right, to drive the new workloads, the additional workloads over to MongoDB as part of that migration. And over time, as we've talked about before, we hope and expect to be able to leverage technology more and more, but at least initially and into the medium-term, there's going to be a healthy human/services component to that. Just wanted to sort of effectively telegraph that out to folks. William Power -- Analyst That's helpful. Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Will. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Rudy Kessinger of DA Davidson. Please go ahead. Rudy Kessinger -- Analyst Hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in here. I believe last quarter you said consumption growth slightly ahead of expectations. And while down slower year-over-year growth versus Q2 last year, the year-over-year growth did improve from Q1. And so, I guess I'm curious for Q3, could you make a comment in that same regard? Obviously, slower on a year-over-year basis than Q3 last year, but was it stable with year-over-year consumption growth in Q2 or better or worse? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Rudy, thanks for the question. We haven't specifically called that out relative to Q2. We did see a lower year-over-year growth as we called out. We did see a seasonal rebound. Usually Q3 is stronger than Q2 and we talked about how that was smaller than in the prior year. So hopefully, that will help you all triangulate. Rudy Kessinger -- Analyst Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. I believe it was on your Q4 call back in March. At that point, Dev, you said it would be at least another year until AI applications are being deployed at scale. It sounds like the commentary that some early large workloads, but out of the thousands, just not many that are at large scale. I guess, is your expectation now that maybe it's still at least another year until we're seeing broad AI application rollouts at scale? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I think a lot of it's a function of the what's happening in the R&D side of AI, right? So for example, today, we don't have a very compelling model designed for our phones, right, because today the phones don't have the computing horsepower to run complex models. So, you don't see a ton of very, very successful consumer apps besides, say, ChatGPT or Claude. So we don't -- we also don't see like hundreds of apps taking off like you saw kind of the first generation of like the Internet or the cloud era, right, or the mobile era. So like I think we're still in the early days of AI. And so while we see a lot of people building AI apps, a lot of them have kind of fairly rudimentary functionality. But I think that over time that's going to change. In fact, I know it will change. I just can't predict when that will happen. But where we do see apps having production, we are having traction, we're seeing them grow very, very quickly and we have a lot of them on our platform. It's just very few of them are really have meaningful. Operator Thank you. And that concludes today's Q&A session. I would like to go ahead and turn the call back over to Dev for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, everyone. I just wanted to say we're really pleased with our Q3 results with strong new business performance and revenue exceeding expectations both -- across both Atlas and EA. We're making the necessary investments to expand our enterprise channel where we see the largest opportunity to establish MongoDB as a standard and the strongest returns on our go-to-market investments. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the progress we're making on both accelerating legacy app modernization with AI as well as establishing ourselves as a standard of the emerging AI tech stack for greenfield AI applications. And last but not least, I would like to thank Michael again for his contributions over the past 10 years and wish him well. Thank you, everyone, and we'll talk to you soon.

congratulate cedric well-deserved promotion. that, let turn call michael. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer thanks, dev, thanks kind word incredible partnership past decade. past 10 year rewarding professional career extremely proud achieved together course, whole mongodb team. much success had, still believe mongodb early stage realizing full potential continues take share one largest market software. now, turning result quarter. begin detailed review third-quarter result finish outlook fourth quarter full fiscal year 2025. first, start third quarter results. total revenue quarter $529.4 million, 22% year-over-year high end guidance. shifting product mix, atlas grew 26% quarter compared previous year represents 68% total revenue compared 66% third quarter fiscal 2024 71% last quarter. recognized atlas revenue primarily based customer consumption platform consumption closely tied end user activity applications. let provide context atlas consumption quarter. q3, consumption slightly ahead expectations. year's q3 seasonal improvement muted year past expected. year-over-year basis, consumption growth remains prior year period. turning non-atlas revenue. non-atlas came significantly ahead expectations. dev mentioned, ea new business strong, continue success selling incremental workload existing customer base. addition, q3 non-atlas revenue benefited large multi-year deals. know, due asc 606, recognized entire term license component multi-year contract start contract. compared q3 last year, multi-year license component non-atlas revenue $15 million higher. turning customer growth. third quarter, grew customer base approximately 1,900 customer sequentially, bringing total customer count 52,600, 46,400 year-ago period. total customer count, 7,400 direct sale customers, compare 6,900 year-ago period. growth total customer count driven primarily atlas, 51,100 customer end quarter compared 44,900 year-ago period. important keep mind growth atlas customer count reflects new customer mongodb addition existing ea customer adding first atlas workload. continuing on, q3, net arr expansion rate approximately 120%. ended quarter 2,314 customer least $100,000 arr annualized mrr, $1,972 year-ago period. moving income statement, discussing result non-gaap basis unless otherwise noted. gross profit third quarter $405.7 million, representing gross margin 77%, flat versus year-ago period. income operation $101.5 million 19% operating margin third quarter compared 18% operating margin year-ago period. primary reason favorable operating income result versus guidance revenue outperformance, including high margin multi-year license revenue benefit. net income third quarter $98.1 million $1.16 per share, based 84.2 million diluted weighted average share outstanding. compare net income $79.1 million $0.96 per share 83.7 million diluted weighted-average share outstanding year-ago period. turning balance sheet cash flow, ended third quarter $2.3 billion cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash. operating cash flow third quarter $37.4 million. taking consideration approximately $2.9 million capital expenditure principal repayment finance lease liabilities, free cash flow $34.6 million quarter. compare free cash flow $35 million year-ago period. q3, incur capital expenditure purchase ipv4 address previously expected, start making purchase november still expect total outlay $20 million $25 million fiscal year previously communicated. like turn outlook fourth quarter full fiscal year 2025. fourth quarter, expect revenue range $515 million $519 million. expect non-gaap income operation range $55 million $58 million non-gaap net income per share range $0.62 $0.65 based 84.9 million estimated diluted weighted-average share outstanding. full-fiscal year 2025, expect revenue range $1.973 billion $1.977 billion, non-gaap income operation range $242 million $245 million, non-gaap net income per share range $3.01 $3.03 based 84 million estimated diluted weighted-average share outstanding. note non-gaap net income per share guidance fourth-quarter full-fiscal year 2025 includes non-gaap tax provision approximately 20%. provide context around updated guidance. first, term atlas consumption, expect see typical seasonal slowdown q4, driven underlying application usage moderating holiday season. second, since atlas consumption remained lower year-over-year basis q3, expect see continued deceleration atlas year-over-year growth q4. third, expect see sequential decline non-atlas revenue q4, contrary normal pattern. reason experienced significant additional benefit multi-year deal q3, expect recur q4. addition, want provide incremental color recent product -- recent product go-to-market change impact growth reported customer count going forward. first, dev explained, reallocating portion go-to-market resource mid-market enterprise channel. result, expect see significantly fewer mid-market direct sale customer net addition result, slower direct sale customer growth going forward. believe reallocation investment dollar drive higher revenue growth time. so, trade-off make sense. second, introduce atlas flex cluster q4 automatically migrate customer q1, expect see one-time negative impact customer count since approximately 4,000 serverless customer low spending expect transition flex. customer negligible impact revenue impact reported customer count. summarize, pleased third quarter result especially ability win new business. small share one largest fastest-growing market software number secular tailwinds, including ai back. continue investing judiciously focusing execution capture long-term opportunity. that, like open questions. operator? question & answers: operator [operator instructions] first question day coming sanjit singh morgan stanley. line open. sanjit singh -- analyst thank taking question congrats, michael, outstanding career. absolutely fantastic run mongodb. excited see next, excited take breather. congrats, michael. guess take question -- start questions, look atlas past two quarters, correct wrong, think consumption coming least modestly ahead expectations. relative seen beginning year, sort -- function sale execution? function end-user activity sort improving? what's driving least improvement atlas consumption past two quarters? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. different things. think look outlook beginning year, indicated thought would see stable atlas growth consumption standpoint. seen talked -- actually seen lower year-over-year growth based underlying consumption. -- that's incorporated q4 guide. seen q3 q4 -- sorry, q2 q3, excuse me, better expectations, still year-over-year basis. want make sure sort confusing comparative set year-over-year versus relative expectations. sanjit singh -- analyst understood. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer core it, sanjit, question really underlying usage applications. sanjit singh -- analyst yeah, make total sense. then, dev, ask ai agent question. term ai agent needing context, going set tool take actions. mean mongodb operational data store customer start roll agentic applications? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. so, talk agents, think think agents, there's jobs, there's -- sorry, there's job, there's project there's task. right now, agent rolled really focused task like say something sierra company rolling agents. right, deemed deal able create rich complex data structures. important ai ai model look isolated data points, need understand relationships, hierarchies, pattern within data. need able essentially get real-time insights. example, chatbot someone querying, customer kind trying get update order placed five minute ago may gotten confirmation, chatbot need able deal real-time information. need able deal basically handling advanced use cases, understanding like, thing like fraud detection understand behavior supply chains, need understand intricate data relationships. thing consistent mongodb offers. believe end day, well-positioned handle this. thing would say embedded natural way search vector search. oltp database, tech search vector search. that's one experience platform offer that, think real advantage. integrated leading ai framework platforms. enterprise-grade security compliance, customer run u anywhere, either 118 cloud region on-prem, huge differentiator us. sanjit singh -- analyst awesome. appreciate thoughts, dev. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, sanjit. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line taylor -- tyler radke citi. line open. tyler radke -- analyst hi, thank much taking question. and, michael, best, congratulation 10 years. going back sale execution, mean, one thing talked earlier year challenge term recently acquired workload ramping. think lot past fiscal year. curious quality workload acquisition trended year. think ramp consumption potential next year, sort look versus time year ago? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. maybe talk change made michael talk little bit consumption trends. so, make change beginning year, really wanted focus volume quality workload slight adjustment made. think change reasonable positive impact. again, early declare victory workload usually start small grow time, really pleased result seeing far. -- again, early days. obviously, know fiscal '25 workload go fiscal '26. far, good. michael, consumption? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, couple things, thanks, tyler. fiscal '24 cohort called earlier, slower growth continue. line revised expectations. made change talked -- earlier year affect fiscal '25 cohorts, early tell. those, need quarter data really see -- seeing behave differently. say talked new business environment success new business. pleased that, show kind initial piece, need see grow cohort evolve. tyler radke -- analyst great. thanks. follow-up ea side, talked outsized strength non-atlas business quarter. maybe could unpack like relative upside driven simply duration versus new business. know called duration impact year-over-year, -- feel like sort one-off feel like maybe bigger customer indexing toward ea impact way think product introducing thing like vector search stream processing onto on-prem product? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah, thank you. overall, continue find ea product resonate customers. important part run anywhere strategy continued see success people wanting increase investment mongodb. there's always multiyear component continue see that. talked beginning year fiscal '24 abnormally high amount multi-year benefit therefore, anticipating headwind quantified roughly $40 million range. talked call earlier saw large accounts, surprising amount multiyear positively benefited q3 little $15 million revenue compared saw q3 year ago. so, much headwind expecting. obviously, 606 dynamics, things, especially large deal kind meaty chunky lumpy, try call sort help people understand, there's pretty healthy kind baseline flow, ea, also multiyear. see spikes, try call you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. want add, tyler, investing call ea business. first, starting investing search vector search community product. couple thing us. one, whenever anyone start mongodb open-source product, immediately get benefit complete highly integrated platform. two, capability migrate ea. so, ea u investment strategy. definitely see lot large customer very, committed running workload on-prem. even see customer want run run ai workload on-prem. so, optionality get using mongodb on-prem cloud, also cross-cloud compelling one. tyler radke -- analyst thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line brad reback stifel. line open. brad reback -- analyst great. thanks much. and, michael, best luck. great run. dev, started call talking bunch investments, great given growth business. obviously, talked reallocating expenses. net-net, think incremental investment phase next year gating margin upside? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer think that's something obviously ready talk next year now, would say -- reason looking invest summarize again, going up-market legacy app modernization see large workload potentially play ideal database genai apps, future important investment drive long-term growth. quite energized investment that's something high conviction on. brad reback -- analyst that's great. maap program, workload going wind atlas healthy combination ea atlas? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer think early days. would say -- would probably say side atlas ea early days. think introduce search vector search ea product, see on-prem. obviously, people use mongodb ai workload using technology well conjunction mongodb on-prem ai use cases. would say probably going see happen first atlas. brad reback -- analyst great. thanks much. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line jason ader william blair. line open. jason ader -- analyst yeah, thank you. going belabor congratulating michael, fun working best luck. question strength ea. think, dev, represents comment enterprise might rethinking reassessing kind on-prem versus cloud workload placement decision? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer well, think large enterprises, think large enterprise meaningful workload still running on-prem. think belief everything would go cloud probably something really popular good old day zurp. think customer assess investment already place, much judicious run workload think leverage existing investment infrastructure, going so. also bunch reason like regulatory reasons, customer quite moving aggressively cloud. see particularly europe, see lot european bank still running majority workload on-prem. also varies region conversely asia, seeing people much move much aggressively cloud. think really depends industry, geography, personal dynamic what's happening particular account. mean, see large u bank also committed running thing on-prem. really varies. that's feel really good run anywhere strategy give customer optionality. build something run on-prem. choose move cloud, easy mongodb. jason ader -- analyst right. follow-up also investment making strategic sale enterprise. could get little specific investment might be? hiring lot new salespeople? working sis, investing sis? additional detail would helpful. thanks. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. everyone's benefit, identified number accounts, call strategic accounts, think high upside us. seen number account grow quickly deploy right mix resources. necessarily quota-carrying resources. could additional technical sale resources, additional p resources, additional customer service resource better service support accounts. even thing like run education session developer accounts, called either hackathons like call developer day even design review meet development team looking build application, help think would potentially use mongodb build particular app. find many developers, experience mongodb quite limited, engage them, educate show simple easy is. like example, customer today think like use oltp database, search database, maybe vector database, like caching database. integrated mongodb. sudden, customer say, wow, simplify life, simplify back-end infrastructure, build app far quickly much easier manage long-term everything mongodb. really function educating power mongodb really open lot opportunity us. that's doubling down, mix resource really predicated accounts, quota counting resources, whole suite resource bringing table. jason ader -- analyst thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line andrew nowinski well fargo. line open. andrew nowinski -- analyst okay. good afternoon. thank much taking question congrats nice quarter. gave example customer migrated postgres think said issue pg vector function. wondering long customer using postgres decided make change mongo, meaning sort like rebound type customer chose pg -- excuse me, postgres work? frequently

quantification timing that? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. reason excited opportunity go legacy application that, one, seems like there's confluence event happening. one increasing cost tax supporting managing legacy apps going enough. second, many customer regulated industries, regulator calling -- fact running legacy apps systemic risk, longer kick road. third, also longer kick around, vendor going end-of-life, make decision migrate application modern tech stack. fourth, genai predicated data build competitive advantage, need leverage proprietary data, people want access data able easily. that's another reason want modernize. also people built application retiring longer firm, creates risk companies. given that, customer incredibly interested figuring way easily safely securely migrate -- applications. always could help easily move data map schema relational schema document schema. hardest part essentially rewriting application. advent genai, significantly reduce time. one, use genai analyze existing code. two, use genai reverse engineer test test code does. three, use genai build new code user test ensure new code produce result old code. time effort suddenly cut meaningful way that's suddenly creating lot interest customer saying, goodness. already relational app, moving another relational app feel like modernization. so, advantage moving mongodb give much modern platform, much agile, flexible, performant, scalable platform future needs. that's excited. again, early days. run number pilot gone well. process working customer migration process. take time very, complex applications. actually, one thing also mentioned going -- saying go tertiary tier 2 tier 3 application, saying, hey, want look crown jewel apps painful us. that's also exciting. again, take time, committed this, think going drive -- help u drive long-term -- meaningful long-term growth. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer

Welcome to the MongoDB third-quarter fiscal year 2025 conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there'll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your speaker for today, Brian Denyeau. Please go ahead. Brian Raferty Denyeau -- Investor Relations Thank you, Lisa. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today to review MongoDB's third-quarter fiscal 2025 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued after the close of the market today. Joining me the call today are Dev Ittycheria, president and CEO of MongoDB; and Michael Gordon, MongoDB's COO and CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our market and future growth opportunities, our expectations for the macroeconomic environment in fiscal 2025 and the impact of AI, the benefits of our product platform, our competitive landscape, customer behaviors, our financial guidance, and our planned investments in growth opportunities in AI. These statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including the results of operations and financial condition that cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. For a discussion of the material risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please refer to the risks described in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 31st, 2024 that we filed with the SEC on August 30th, 2024. Any forward-looking statements made on this call reflect our views only as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them except as required by law. Additionally, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures on this conference call. Please refer to the tables in our earnings release in the Investor Relations portion of our website for a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dev. Dev? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we had a strong quarter of new business and executed well against our large market opportunity. Let's begin by reviewing our third quarter results before giving you a broader company update. We generated revenue of $529 million, a 22% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew 26% year-over-year, representing 68% of total revenue. We generated non-GAAP operating income of $101 million for a 19% non-GAAP operating margin and we ended the quarter with over 52,600 customers. Overall, we were pleased with our performance in the third quarter. We had a strong new business quarter and we're happy with our new workload acquisition on Atlas. Our non-Atlas business significantly exceeded expectations in part because we benefited from a few large multi-year deals as customers continue to value our run anywhere strategy and want to build a deeper longer-term relationship with MongoDB. Atlas consumption was slightly better than expected in a macro-environment that we would characterize as largely consistent with what we saw in the first half of the year. Michael will cover consumption trends in more detail. Retention rates remained strong in Q3, demonstrating the mission criticality of our platform. On our Q1 earnings call, we shared with you the three major strategic initiatives that we believe will enable us to maximize our long-term opportunity. I want to give you an update on the progress we're making on those initiatives. First, we are increasing our investment in the enterprise channel since we see the strongest returns in this part of the market. Specifically, we're expanding our strategic account program going to next year, as we see more accounts that will benefit from incremental investment. In addition, we're investing time and resources to educate developers in large enterprise accounts and uplevel their MongoDB skills. These organizations have thousands of developers and as we penetrate them more deeply, we encounter developers who have historically only built SQL applications and simply do not know how to use MongoDB to its full potential. In our experience, educating these developers on the benefits of MongoDB drives significant incremental adoption of our platform. To fund these up-market investments, we are reallocating a portion of our mid-market investments. The mid-market remains an attractive opportunity for us, but we believe that prioritizing investment up-market will deliver strong returns in the current environment. We also believe there are additional ways to serve the mid-market more efficiently through our self-serve channel and other scaled technology-enabled sales and customer service motions. Second, we are optimistic about the opportunity to accelerate legacy app modernization using AI and are investing more in this area. As you recall, we ran a few successful pilots earlier this year, demonstrating that AI tooling combined with professional services and our relational migrator product can significantly reduce the time, cost, and risk of migrating legacy applications onto MongoDB. While it's early days, we have observed a more than 50% reduction in the cost to modernize. On the back of these strong early results, additional customer interest is exceeding our expectations. Large enterprises in every industry and geography are experiencing acute pain from their legacy infrastructure and are eager for more agile, performant, and cost-effective solutions. Not only are customers excited to engage with us, they also want to focus on some of the most important applications in their enterprise, further demonstrating the level of interest and size of the long-term opportunity. As relational applications encompass a wide variety of database types, programming languages, versions, and other customer-specific variables, we expect modernization projects to continue to include meaningful service engagements in the short and medium term. Consequently, we're increasing our professional services delivery capabilities, both directly and through partners. In the long run, we expect to automate and simplify large parts of the modernization process. To that end, we are leveraging the learnings from early service engagement to develop new tools to accelerate future modernization efforts. Although it's early days and scaling our legacy app modernization capabilities will take time, we have increased conviction that this motion will significantly add to our growth in the long term. Third, we are investing to capitalize on our inherent technical advantages as a key component of the emerging AI tech stack. As a reminder, MongoDB is uniquely equipped to query rich and complex data structures typical of AI applications. The ability of a database to query rich and complex data structures is crucial because AI applications often rely on highly detailed, interrelated, and nuanced data to make accurate predictions and decisions. For example, a recommendation system doesn't just analyze a single customer's purchase but also considers their browsing history, peer group behavior, and product categories requiring a database that can query and interlink these complex data structures. In addition, MongoDB's architecture unifies source data, metadata, operational data, and vector data in an all-in-one platform, updating the need for multiple database systems and complex back-end architectures. This enables a more compelling developer experience than any other alternative. From what we see in the AI market today, most customers are still in the experimental stage as they work to understand the effectiveness of the underlying tech stack and build early proof-of-concept applications. However, we are seeing an increasing number of AI apps in production. Today, we have thousands of AI apps on our platform. What we don't yet see is many of these apps actually achieving meaningful product market fit and therefore significant traction. In fact, as you take a step back and look at the entire universe of AI apps, a very small percentage of them have achieved the type of scale that we commonly see with enterprise-specific applications. We do have some AI apps that are growing quickly, including one that is already a seven-figure workload that has grown 10 times since the beginning of the year. Similar to prior platform shifts as the usefulness of AI tech improves and becomes more cost-effective, we will see the emergence of many more AI apps that do nail product market fit, but it's difficult to predict when that will happen more broadly. We remain confident that we will capture our fair share of these successful AI applications as we see that our platform is popular with developers building more sophisticated AI use cases. We continue investing in our product capabilities, including enterprise-grade Atlas Vector Search functionality to build on this momentum and even better position MongoDB to capture the AI opportunity. In addition, as previously announced, we are bringing search and vector service to our community and EA offerings, leveraging our run anywhere competitive advantage in the world of AI. Finally, we are expanding our MongoDB AI applications program or MAAP, which helps enterprise customers build and bring AI applications into production by providing them with reference architectures, integrations with leading tech providers, and coordinated services and support. Last week, we announced a new code of partners including McKinsey, Confluent, Capgemini, and Unstructured, as well as the collaboration with Meta to enable developers to build AI-enriched applications on MongoDB using Llama. Next, I'd like to provide you with a brief product update. At our dot local developer conference in London in October, we announced the general availability of MongoDB 8.0, the fastest and most performant version of MongoDB ever. MongoDB 8.0 performs 20% to 60% better against common industry benchmarks compared to our prior version and is built to exceed our customers' most stringent security, resiliency, availability, and performance requirements. To best serve our customers, we regularly review and reprioritize investments in our product portfolio to ensure we're allocating our resources to products with the highest demand from our customers. And to do that, we also deprecate products that are not showing results we desired. Consequently, we made the decision to consolidate our Atlas serverless offerings with our smallest dedicated tiers to create Atlas Flex customers, a new offering with a simpler architecture that provides the elasticity features akin to serverless. We will begin migrating effective customers to the single, simple, entry-level solution in Q4. We also decided to deprecate Atlas DeviceSync and other capabilities not widely adopted in order to focus our engineering resources on the core platform. While these reprioritization decisions are not made lightly, they allow us to deliver the most value to the largest number of customers, reinforcing our commitment to being the best modern database and helping us to grow faster. Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the adoption trends of MongoDB across our customer base. Customers across industries and around the world are running mission-critical projects in MongoDB Atlas, leveraging the full power of our developer data platform, including Financial Times, CarGurus, and Victoria's Secret. As part of the digital transformation journey, global specialty retailer Victoria's Secret & Company migrated its e-commerce platform to MongoDB Atlas. As a fully managed platform, MongoDB Atlas allowed the company to simplify its architecture and improve performance, supporting the retailer to provide a resilient, secure, and fast web and mobile e-commerce experience for their millions of customers around the world. Allianz, Alphamad, Swiss Post, and Paylocity are turning to MongoDB to modernize applications. Paylocity, a leading provider of cloud-based payroll and human capital management software, selected MongoDB to power proprietary application aimed at fostering employee connections and engagement. When traffic increased and the original SQL-based solution was unable to keep up with the required performance metrics, Paylocity migrated to MongoDB Atlas to take advantage of the flexible schema architecture, performance, and scalability. MongoDB costs five times less than the previous SQL database solution and the company's developers can now create an application within minutes, something that used to take weeks. Mature companies and start-ups alike are using MongoDB to help deliver the next wave of AI-powered application to customers, including NerdWallet, Cisco, and Tealbook. Tealbook, a supplier intelligence platform, migrated from Postgres, pgvector, and ElasticSearch to MongoDB to eliminate technical debt and consolidate their tech stack. The company experienced workload isolation and scalability issues in pgvector and were concerned with the search index inconsistencies, which were all resolved with the migration to MongoDB. With Atlas Vector search and dedicated search nodes, Tealbook has realized improved cost-efficiency and increased scalability for the supplier data platform, an application that uses GenAI to collect, verify, and enrich supplier data across various sources. In summary, we had a healthy Q3 with both Atlas and EA exceeding expectations. We saw a strong new business quarter and we remain confident in our ability to become an increasing strategic provider in our large and growing market. Looking forward, we see a great opportunity to grow our adoption in the enterprise through new workloads, modernizing legacy applications, and winning the next generation of AI-powered applications. I would like to finish by providing an update on our senior leadership. First, as we announced early in the press release, after nearly 10 years, Michael Gordon has made the decision to leave MongoDB. Michael has been instrumental in MongoDB's success over the past decade, leading our successful IPO, helping us grow our revenue nearly 50-fold, and scaling -- and successfully scaling our business model to generate meaningful operating leverage. He has been a trusted advisor and business partner to the Board and me over the years and also has become a personal friend. Michael is excited to take a well-deserved break. We have commenced the search for Michael's replacement and will be evaluating both internal and external candidates. One of Michael's proudest compliments -- accomplishments has been building a world-class finance team under his leadership, and I'm confident that we will not miss a beat during this transition. Michael will continue to serve as CFO through January 31st to help us finish the fiscal year and then will transition to an Advisor to the company to ensure a seamless process. If we have not named Michael's successor by fiscal year-end, Serge Tanjga, SVP of Finance, will serve as Interim CFO, beginning on February 1st. Second, we are promoting Cedric Pech, currently our chief revenue officer to the newly created role of president worldwide field operations. In this new position, Cedric will oversee all our field-based customer-facing and go-to-market enablement teams, including professional services. We believe this org structure will best enable us to execute on some of the key strategic initiatives I discussed earlier, in particular, our increased focus on up-market and the app monetization opportunity. I would like to congratulate Cedric on this well-deserved promotion. With that, let me turn the call over to Michael. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Dev, and thanks for the kind words and our incredible partnership over the past decade. The past 10 years have been the most rewarding in my professional career and I'm extremely proud of what we've achieved together and of course, to the whole MongoDB team. With as much success as we had, I still believe that MongoDB is in the early stages of realizing its full potential as it continues to take share in one of the largest markets in software. Now, turning to the results for the quarter. I'll begin with a detailed review of our third-quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025. First, I'll start with our third quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $529.4 million, up 22% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance. Shifting to our product mix, Atlas grew 26% in the quarter compared to the previous year and now represents 68% of total revenue compared to 66% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and 71% last quarter. We recognized Atlas revenue primarily based on customer consumption of our platform and that consumption is closely tied to end user activity of their applications. Let me provide some context on Atlas consumption in the quarter. In Q3, consumption was slightly ahead of our expectations. This year's Q3 seasonal improvement was more muted than in years past as expected. On a year-over-year basis, consumption growth remains below that of prior year period. Turning to non-Atlas revenue. Non-Atlas came in significantly ahead of our expectations. As Dev mentioned, EA new business was strong, and we continue to have success selling incremental workloads into our existing customer base. In addition, our Q3 non-Atlas revenue benefited from a few large multi-year deals. As you know, due to ASC 606, we recognized the entire term license component of a multi-year contract at the start of that contract. Compared to Q3 of last year, the multi-year license component of non-Atlas revenues was over $15 million higher. Turning to customer growth. During the third quarter, we grew our customer base by approximately 1,900 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 52,600, which is up from over 46,400 in the year-ago period. Of our total customer count, over 7,400 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 6,900 in the year-ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven primarily by Atlas, which had over 51,100 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 44,900 in the year-ago period. It is important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers adding their first Atlas workload. Continuing on, in Q3, our net ARR expansion rate was approximately 120%. We ended the quarter with 2,314 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, up from $1,972 in the year-ago period. Moving down the income statement, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the third quarter was $405.7 million, representing a gross margin of 77%, which is flat versus the year-ago period. Our income from operations was $101.5 million or 19% operating margin for the third quarter compared to an 18% operating margin in the year-ago period. The primary reason for more favorable operating income results versus guidance is our revenue outperformance, including the very high margin multi-year license revenue benefit. Net income in the third quarter was $98.1 million or $1.16 per share, based on 84.2 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a net income of $79.1 million or $0.96 per share on 83.7 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding in the year-ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the third quarter with $2.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $37.4 million. After taking into consideration approximately $2.9 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was $34.6 million in the quarter. This compares to free cash flow of $35 million in the year-ago period. In Q3, we did not incur capital expenditures to purchase IPV4 addresses as we previously expected, but we did start making those purchases in November and still expect a total outlay of $20 million to $25 million this fiscal year as we previously communicated. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $515 million to $519 million. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $55 million to $58 million and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.65 based on 84.9 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. For the full-fiscal year 2025, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.973 billion to $1.977 billion, non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $242 million to $245 million, and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $3.01 to $3.03 based on 84 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. Note that the non-GAAP net income per share guidance for the fourth-quarter and full-fiscal year 2025 includes a non-GAAP tax provision of approximately 20%. I'll now provide some more context around our updated guidance. First, in terms of Atlas consumption, we expect to see a typical seasonal slowdown in Q4, driven by underlying application usage moderating during the holiday season. Second, since Atlas consumption remained lower on a year-over-year basis in Q3, we expect to see continued deceleration of Atlas year-over-year growth in Q4. Third, we expect to see a sequential decline in non-Atlas revenue in Q4, which is contrary to our normal pattern. The reason for this is that we experienced a significant additional benefit from multi-year deals in Q3, which we do not expect to recur in Q4. In addition, I want to provide some incremental color on some of our recent product and -- how some of our recent product and go-to-market changes will impact the growth of our reported customer count going forward. First, as Dev explained, we are reallocating a portion of our go-to-market resources from the mid-market to the enterprise channel. As a result, we expect to see significantly fewer mid-market direct sales customer net additions and as a result, slower direct sales customer growth going forward. We believe this reallocation of investment dollars will drive higher revenue growth over time. So, it's a trade-off that makes sense. Second, as we introduce Atlas Flex clusters in Q4 and automatically migrate customers in Q1, we expect to see a one-time negative impact to our customer count since we have approximately 4,000 serverless customers who are very low spending and we do not expect them to transition over to Flex. These customers have a negligible impact on our revenue but will impact our reported customer count. To summarize, we're pleased with our third quarter results and especially our ability to win new business. We have a small share in one of the largest and fastest-growing markets in all of software with a number of secular tailwinds, including AI at our back. We'll continue investing judiciously and focusing on our execution to capture this long-term opportunity. With that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator? Questions & Answers: Operator [Operator instructions] Our first question for the day will be coming from Sanjit Singh of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Thank you for taking the questions and congrats, Michael, on outstanding career. You had an absolutely fantastic run at MongoDB. I'm excited to see what you do next, or excited if you just take a breather. So congrats, Michael. I guess to take the question -- to start off with the questions, when we look at what Atlas has been doing in the past two quarters, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think consumption is coming in at least modestly ahead of your expectations. Relative to what we've seen at the beginning of the year, what sort of -- is it a function of sales execution? Is it a function of the end-user activity sort of improving? What's driving at least the improvement in Atlas consumption in the past two quarters? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So a few different things. So I think if you look at our outlook at the beginning of the year, we had indicated that we thought we would see stable Atlas growth from a consumption standpoint. What we've seen and what we've talked about is -- we've actually seen lower year-over-year growth based on the underlying consumption. And so -- and that's incorporated into our Q4 guide. We have seen the Q3 and Q4 be -- sorry, Q2 and Q3, excuse me, be better than our expectations, but it's still down on a year-over-year basis. And so I want to make sure that we're not sort of confusing the comparative set of year-over-year versus relative to our expectations. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Understood. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer And the core of it, Sanjit, to your question is really the underlying usage of the applications. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Yeah, that makes total sense. And then, Dev, I have to ask you the AI agent question. In terms of an AI agent needing more context, it has going to have a set of tools to take its actions. What does it mean for MongoDB as an operational data store as customers start to roll out more agentic applications? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, just to talk about agents, I think when you think about agents, there's jobs, there's -- sorry, there's a job, there's projects and then there's task. Right now, the agents that are being rolled out are really focused on task like say something from Sierra or some other companies are rolling out agents. But you're right, what they deemed to do is to deal with being able to create a rich and complex data structures. Now why is this important for AI is that AI models don't just look at isolated data points, but they need to understand relationships, hierarchies, and patterns within the data. They need to be able to essentially get real-time insights. For example, if you have a chatbot where someone is querying, a customer is kind of trying to get some update on the order they placed five minutes ago because they may have not gotten any confirmation, your chatbot needs to be able to deal with real-time information. You need to be able to deal with basically handling very advanced use cases, understanding like, to do things like fraud detection to understand behaviors of supply chains, you need to understand intricate data relationships. All these things are consistent with MongoDB offers. And so we believe that at the end of the day, we are well-positioned to handle this. And the other thing that I would say is that we've embedded in a very natural way of search and vector search. So we're just not an OLTP database, we do tech search and vector search. That's all one experience and no other platform offers that, and we think we have a real advantage. And so we're integrated with the leading AI frameworks and platforms. We have enterprise-grade security and compliance, and customers can run us anywhere, either on 118 cloud regions or on-prem, and that again is a huge differentiator for us. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Awesome. Appreciate the thoughts, Dev. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Sanjit. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Taylor -- Tyler Radke of Citi. Your line is open. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Hi, thank you very much for taking the question. And, Michael, all the best, and congratulations on 10 years. Going back to the sales execution, I mean, one of the things that you talked about earlier this year was some challenges just in terms of the recently acquired workloads ramping. And I think a lot of those were from the past fiscal year. So curious how the quality of workload acquisition has trended this year. And as you think about the ramp in consumption potential into next year, how does that sort of look versus this time a year ago? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Maybe I'll just talk about what we're doing and the changes we made and then Michael can talk a little bit about the consumption trends. So, we did make some changes at the beginning of the year, and we really wanted to focus on both the volume and the quality of the workloads and there were some slight adjustments that we made. We think those changes are having a reasonable positive impact. Again, it's too early to declare victory because these workloads usually start small and grow over time, but we're really pleased with the results we're seeing so far. And -- but again, it's early days. And obviously, we'll know about the fiscal '25 workloads as we go into fiscal '26. But so far, so good. Michael, on consumption? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, just a couple of things, and thanks, Tyler. The fiscal '24 cohorts that we called out earlier, that slower growth does continue. They've been in line with our revised expectations. We made some changes that we talked about at the -- earlier in the year that should affect the fiscal '25 cohorts, but it's just too early to tell. On those, we need a few more quarters of data before you can really see if we're -- how we're seeing those behave differently. I will say we've talked about the new business environment and our success in new business. We have been pleased with that, but that just shows kind of the initial piece, and we need to see how they grow and how those cohorts evolve. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Great. Thanks. And follow-up on the EA side, you talked about the outsized strength in non-Atlas business this quarter. Maybe if you could unpack like the relative upside that was driven by simply duration versus new business. I know you called out the duration impact year-over-year, but are -- do you feel like this was sort of a one-off or do you feel like maybe some of your bigger customers are indexing more toward EA and how does that impact the way you think about the product and introducing things like vector search and stream processing onto the on-prem product? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, thank you. So overall, we continue to find the EA product resonate with customers. It's an important part of the run anywhere strategy and we've continued to see success with that and people wanting to increase their investment in MongoDB. There's always been a multiyear component and we continue to see that. We talked about that at the beginning of the year as to how fiscal '24 had an abnormally high amount of multi-year benefit and therefore, we were anticipating that being a headwind and we quantified that in roughly the $40 million range. What we talked about on this call earlier is we saw from a few large accounts, a surprising amount of multiyear that positively benefited Q3 at a little more than $15 million in revenue compared to what we saw Q3 a year ago. So, not as much of a headwind as we had been expecting. Obviously, with the 606 dynamics, some of these things, especially for a large deal can be kind of meaty and chunky and lumpy, which is why we try and call it out and sort of help people understand, but there's a pretty healthy kind of baseline flow, not just of EA, but also of multiyear. And when we see spikes, we just try and call it out for you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I just want to add, Tyler, that we are investing in our what we call our EA business. First, we're starting by investing with search and vector search and a community product. That does a couple of things for us. One, whenever anyone starts with MongoDB with the open-source product, they immediately get all the benefits of that complete highly integrated platform. Two, those capabilities will then migrate to EA. So, EA for us is an investment strategy. We definitely see lots of large customers who are very, very committed to running workloads on-prem. We even see some customers want to run to run AI workloads on-prem. So, the optionality they get by using MongoDB to not just be on-prem and the cloud, but also cross-cloud is a very compelling one. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Brad Reback of Stifel. Your line is open. Brad Reback -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. And, Michael, best of luck. It's been a great run. Dev, you started the call talking about a bunch of investments, which are great given the growth of the business. And obviously, you talked about reallocating some expenses. But net-net, should we think about this incremental investment phase next year as gating margin upside? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think that's something that we obviously are not ready to talk about next year just now, but I would say that we -- the reason we're looking to invest and just to summarize again, going up-market on legacy app modernization where we see very large workloads potentially at play and being the ideal database for GenAI apps, which is the future as important investments to drive long-term growth. And we're quite energized by those investments and that's something that we have high conviction on. Brad Reback -- Analyst That's great. And then on the MAAP program, are most of those workloads going to wind up in Atlas or will that be a healthy combination of EA and Atlas? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think it's again early days. I would say -- I would probably say more on the side of Atlas and EA in the early days. I think once we introduce a search and vector search into the EA product, you'll see more of that on-prem. Obviously, people can use MongoDB for AI workloads using other technologies as well in conjunction with MongoDB for on-prem AI use cases. But I would say you're probably going to see that happen first in Atlas. Brad Reback -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Jason Ader of William Blair. Your line is open. Jason Ader -- Analyst Yeah, thank you. I'm not going to belabor congratulating Michael, but it has been it has been fun working with you and best of luck. The question I had is on the strength in EA. Do you think, Dev, it represents a comment on how enterprises might be rethinking or reassessing the kind of on-prem versus cloud workload placement decision? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Well, when I think about large enterprises, I think large enterprises have meaningful workloads that are still running on-prem. I think the belief that everything would go to the cloud was probably something that was really popular in the good old days of Zurp. But I think now as customers assess their investments that they already have in place, they're being much more judicious about where they run those workloads and if they think they can leverage their existing investments in their own infrastructure, then they're going to do so. Also for a bunch of other reasons like regulatory reasons, some customers are quite not moving as aggressively to the cloud. We see that in particularly in Europe, where we see a lot of the European banks still running majority of the workloads on-prem. So it also varies by region where conversely in Asia, we're seeing people much move much more aggressively to the cloud. So I think it really depends on industry, on geography, and on the personal dynamics of what's happening in that particular account. I mean, we see some large US banks are also very committed to running things on-prem. So it really varies. And that's why we feel really good about our run anywhere strategy because it gives customer optionality. They can build something and run on-prem. And if and when they choose to move to the cloud, it's very easy to do so with MongoDB. Jason Ader -- Analyst All right. And then just as a follow-up also on the investments you're making in strategic sales and enterprise. Could you just get a little more specific on what those investments might be? Is it hiring a lot of new salespeople? Is it working more with SIs, investing more in SIs? Any additional detail would be helpful. Thanks. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So just for everyone's benefit, we've identified a number of accounts, which we call strategic accounts, which we think that have high upside for us. We've seen a number of accounts that grow very quickly when we deploy the right mix of resources. Now they're all not necessarily quota-carrying resources. They could be additional technical sales resources, additional PS resources, additional customer service resources to better service and support those accounts. We even do things like run education sessions for developers of the accounts, they're called either hackathons or like what we call developer days or even design reviews where we'll meet with our development teams who are looking to build an application, help them think about how they would potentially use MongoDB to build that particular app. And what we find is that because many of these developers, the experience with MongoDB is quite limited, the more we can engage with them, the more we can educate them and the more we can show them how simple and easy it is. Like for example, most customers today think like they have to use an OLTP database, then a search database, maybe a vector database, and then like a caching database. And all that is integrated in MongoDB. So all of a sudden, customers can say, wow, I can simplify my life, simplify my back-end infrastructure, build this app far more quickly and it will be much more easier to manage long-term if I do everything on MongoDB. And it's really a function of just educating them on the power of MongoDB that really opens up a lot of opportunities for us. So that's why we're doubling down, and the mix of resources is really predicated on the accounts, but it's not just quota counting resources, it's the whole suite of resources that we're bringing to the table. Jason Ader -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Andrew Nowinski of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Okay. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking the question and congrats on a nice quarter. You gave an example of a customer that migrated off Postgres and I think you said they had issues with their PG vector function. I was wondering how long was that customer using Postgres before they decided to make a change to Mongo, meaning was this some sort of like a rebound type customer where they chose PG -- or excuse me, Postgres and it didn't work? And then how frequently are you seeing this type of transition? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So I can't give you the specifics on how long they were using Postgres, but this is not -- this is a trend that we're seeing in our business. You have to remember Postgres is a 40-year-old technology. It's -- and they have been the beneficiary of people lifting and shifting from other types of relational databases, Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, et cetera. And they're an open-source database. And but as part -- because they're an open-source and relational database, they have the same inherent challenges all relational databases do. They're quite inflexible. So once you build a schema, it's very hard to change the schema. It's hard to scale and hard to distribute data. And if you have large data volumes, you have to do weird things like, for example, resort to off-road storage for large data objects, which creates performance bottlenecks. And so again, people default to Postgres if they don't know anything better because all they know is relational and everyone is kind of moving off those other relational platforms. And that's the whole point I was saying earlier. Once we educate developers on the flexibility of schema, how easily or horizontally scale the rich query language where you can do aggregations and do sophisticated geospatial indexes, the productivity gains by using the document model and how easy is to organize data, it's -- people are just like, wow, life is so much easier. Now I want to be clear, this is not a zero-sum game. Postgres does not have to fail for us to be successful. It's a big market and we're quite excited about the opportunity, but we do see customers moving off Postgres and coming to MongoDB. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Thank you. That was very helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up. If we normalize the $15 million multiyear deal impact you had in Q3, would EA still be down sequentially in Q4? Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer We haven't given that level of guidance, but just trying to help you understand in the context of the full-year numbers and the headwind that we talked about at the beginning of the year, just given the strength that we saw in Q3. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Got it. Thanks. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. The next question will be coming from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst Hey, thank you. And if you think about the EA strength this quarter, Michael, you'd kind of give us a little bit there. Like how should we think about renewal -- the renewal situation renewal pool coming up like or that you had in Q3, coming up in Q4, et cetera, as well and then like what does it mean in terms of upsell, cross-sell opportunity as people think about starting AI projects by self-serve, as you kind of mentioned earlier on the call? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So I think about -- if you think about EA for Q4, it tends to be a large renewal quarter, but what we're talking about in terms of the guide is because we had such strength in multiyear, that's where we would expect to see our EA down sequentially, which is not typically our pattern, which is why we called it out. In terms of AI workloads and some of those other things, I think it's early to tell and obviously, we'll continue to evolve and assess our view when we get to the full-year guide in March. And then we'll also have an updated view on how the cohorts are behaving and sort of how multiyear played out. But I think in terms of Q4, the comments that I made earlier hopefully will help. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst Yeah. Okay, perfect. And then the -- and can you talk a little bit about like obviously, there's a debate of like which database will be the persistent layer if you do AI projects, et cetera. What do you see from the big hyperscalers in terms of working with you guys and partnerships? We obviously just have AWS kind of summit, et-cetera. Can you speak a little bit like how your relationship with those big guys is evolving around this? And Michael, All the best in case I don't talk to you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, I'll start with the partnerships first, like our -- with AWS, as you said, they just had their re:Invent show last week. Our -- it remains very, very strong. We've closed a ton of deals this past quarter. Some of them very, very large deals. We're doing integrations to some of the new products like Q and Bedrock and the engagement in the field has been really strong. On Azure, I think we -- as I've shared in the past, we start-off with a little bit of a slow start, but in the words of the person who runs their partner leadership, the Azure MongoDB relationship has never been stronger. We've closed a large number of deals. We're part of what's called the Azure native IC service program and have a bunch of deep integrations with Azure, including Fabric, Power BI, Visual Studio, Semantic Kernel, and Azure OpenAI Studio. And we're also one of Azure's largest marketplace partners. And GCP does -- we have actually seen some uptick in terms of co-sales that we've done this past quarter and GCP made some comp changes where they -- that were favorable to working with MongoDB that we saw some results in the field, and we're focused on closing on -- closing a handful of large deals with GCP in Q4. So in general, I would say, things are going quite well. And then in terms of, I guess, implying your question was like the hyperscalers and are they potentially bundling things along with their AI offerings? I mean, candidly, since day one, the hyperscalers have been bundling their database offerings with every offering that they have and that's been their predominant strategy. And we've -- I think we've executed well against strategy because databases are not like a by-the-way decision. It's an important decision. And I think the hyperscalers are seeing our performance and realize it's better to partner with us. And as I said, customers understand the importance of the data layer, especially for AI applications. And so the partnership across all three hyperscalers is strong. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst OK, perfect. Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Raimo. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. The next question will be coming from the line of Brad Sills of Bank of America. Your line is open. Brad Sills -- Analyst Great. Thank you so much, and congratulations, Michael, on your next move. I wanted to ask about new workloads here on vector search, stream processing, relational migrator. Is there any one of those three that's ramping faster than maybe you expected? Just a little bit of color on how those new workload types are ramping. Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I'll kind of give you just a rundown of some of the -- I mean, essentially you're asking about the new products, like our -- on search, we introduced a new capability called Atlas search nodes, which where you can asymmetrically scale your search nodes because if you have a search-intensive use case, you don't have to scale all your nodes because they have become quite expensive. And we've seen that this kind of groundbreaking capability really well received. The demand is quite high and because customers like they can tune the configuration to the unique needs of their search requirements. One of the world's largest banks is using Atlas Search to provide like a Google-like search experience on payments data for massive corporate customers. So this is a customer-facing application and so performance, and scalability are critical. A leading provider of AI-powered accounting software uses Atlas Search to power its invoice analytics future, which allows end users and finance teams to perform ad-hoc analysis and easily find past-due invoices and voices that contain errors. So that search -- on vector search, it -- again, and it's been our kind of our first full-year since going generally available. And the product uptake has been actually very, very high. In Q3, we released quantization for Atlas Vector Search, which reduces the memory requirements by up to 96%, allowing us to support larger vector workloads with vastly improved price performance. For example, a multinational news organization created a GenAI powered tool designed to help producers and journalists efficiently search, summarize, and verify information from vast and varied data sources. A leading security firm is using Atlas Vector Search to fight AI fraud and a leading global media company replaced elastic search with hybrid search and vector search use case for a user recommendation engine that's built to suggest -- that's built in to suggest articles to end users. And so that's super exciting to see as well. We're also seeing a lot of interest in our streaming product, demand is very high. We just rolled it out to another hyperscaler, and customers are commenting on that the use cases of being able to embed stream processing with MongoDB makes our life so much easier. So overall, we're quite pleased with the progress we're making on the new products. And as I said before, natively bundling all these capabilities really reduces or eliminates the need for customers to have to bolt on a bunch of different technologies to solve the same problem, saving them a lot of time, money, cost, and risk. Brad Sills -- Analyst That's really exciting. Thanks, Dev. And then I wanted to ask a question around Cedric's appointment. Any focus that may be different here under his leadership that we should be thinking about going forward? Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer No, Cedric has been our CRO for, gosh, now like I think like five, six years, and he -- I was the Interim CRO for about three quarters until he took over when we last made a change and this is really an expansion of his responsibilities. I've known Cedric for a long time. He and I have worked with at multiple different companies. I think I have a good barometer for understanding sales leadership. There's a number of sales leaders who worked at other top-tier software companies who used to work for me or with me. And so I'm super-excited by the role Cedric is going to take and then we're also making some changes under Cedric to better align the different organizations so that we can more tightly work together on going up-market, on app monetization and positioning ourselves well to be the ideal database for GenAI apps. Brad Sills -- Analyst Super exciting. Thanks, Dev. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Brad. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question, please. Our next question will be coming from the line of Mike Cikos of Needham and Company. Your line is open. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Hey guys, thanks for taking the question here. I just wanted to come back to the consumption growth being slightly better than expectations again for the second quarter in a row now. And apologies if I missed it, but this improvement that we're seeing, is this across all vintages and geographies or is it potentially more concentrated in scope? Just trying to get a better understanding of what's seeking place out there and what's embedded in the guide. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. No, I would describe it as broad-based, Mike. And obviously, we're pleased to see it and we're continuing monitoring and slicing and dicing it in different ways. And as we have information or insights to you, we'll share it. And without trying to throw a whole bunch of cold water on our mind, it was slightly better, or a step-function changed better, but good to see. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Terrific. And maybe for a quick follow-up for Dev. I think it builds off maybe Tyler's question at the top of the Q&A, but you had cited that some customers are thinking about their workloads more holistically and even looking to run AI workloads on-prem. How much of that do you think is just a function of customers are still trying to figure out how to optimize for latency and cost or is this more a demonstration of we really are in the early phases of the exploratory phase versus going into production? Is there any way to coarse that out or is the two not necessarily connected? Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer No, I think it's kind of a little bit of both. I think you have some customers who are very committed to running a big part of the estate on-prem. So by definition, then if they're going to build an AI workload, it has to be run on-prem, which means that they also need access to GPUs and they're doing that. And then other customers are leveraging basically renting GPUs from the cloud providers and building their own AI workloads. I do think we're in the very, very early days. They're still learning, experimenting. More-and-more apps are entering production. And as I said on the prepared remarks, we have thousands of workload -- AI workloads running on MongoDB, but a very small percentage of them have demonstrated meaningful product market fit. And so the initial traction is kind of still small. But I think as people get more sophisticated with AI, as the AI technology matures and becomes more and more useful, I think applications will -- you'll start seeing these applications take-off. I kind of chuckled that today I see more senior leaders bragging about the chips they're using versus the apps they're building. So it just tells you that we're still in the very, very early days of this big platform shift. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Great point. Thank you again, guys. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Mike. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Eric Heath of KeyBanc. Your line is open. Eric Heath -- Analyst Hi, thanks for taking the question. Dev, Michael, it sounds like the takeaway from the call is a greater focus on EA and on enterprise. So should we structurally rethink the EA business differently and think of this more as a healthy double-digit growth business going forward for the foreseeable future? And then if I could just ask a follow-up question separate to that. But Michael, I understand that it's still early to identify the fiscal '25 cohort of workloads, but just curious at a high-level if they look and feel like of higher quality than the fiscal '24 cohort of workflow. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Do you want to take on the first one in terms of EA... Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, I mean, I would say, I mean, we are very committed to our run anywhere strategy. And as I said, we are first investing in community where for many customers is the first way they experience MongoDB. And we want them to have the full experience of integrating search and Vector search into our core product. And so they can out of the gate really start building applications. That will then transition to building those capabilities into EA. So, we are clearly investing in the EA product. But Atlas is still a big, big part of our business and a big, big part of our growth engine and we typically launch new features on Atlas and because of the capabilities we already have, the fact it's multi-cloud makes it a very, very compelling offering for many customers. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. And I think in terms of the workloads, I do think it's early. Just as a reminder for folks, they tend to start small, although grow quickly. I think the only other thing that I can add is, we've been pretty consistent and that we've been pleased with the new business that we've done. But we need some time to let the cohorts play out as we track them. But I think like I said, we've been happy with the new business that we were winning. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of William Power of Baird. Your line is open. Brian Raferty Denyeau -- Investor Relations You there, William? William Power -- Analyst Sorry, yeah. Thank you. Dev, you had some encouraging comments on relational migrator. I wonder if you could just touch on what you think is driving the higher interest here. I mean, it sounds like AI is contributing and helping, but it'd be great to get some more color there because that still feels like obviously a meaningful long-term opportunity. And then maybe the second part of the question for Dev or Michael, just be great to get any other framework around the professional services investments. Any way to kind of think about quantification and timing of that? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So the reason we're so excited about the opportunity to go after legacy applications is that, one, it seems like there's a confluence of events happening. One is that the increasing cost and tax of supporting and managing these legacy apps are just going up enough. Second, for many customers who are in regulated industries, the regulators are calling their -- the fact that they're running on these legacy apps with systemic risk, so they can no longer kick the can down the road. Third, also because they no longer can kick the can around, some vendors are going end-of-life, so they have to make a decision to migrate those applications to a more modern tech stack. Fourth, because GenAI is so predicated on data and to build a competitive advantage, you need to leverage your proprietary data, people want to access that data and be able to do so easily. And so that's another reason for them to want to modernize. And then you also have people who built those applications who are retiring or just no longer in the firm, so it just creates more and more risk for the companies. Given all that, customers are incredibly interested in figuring out a way to easily and safely and securely migrate those -- off those applications. And we always could help them very easily move the data and map the schema from a relational schema to a document schema. The hardest part was essentially rewriting the application. Now with the advent of GenAI, you can now significantly reduce the time. One, you can use GenAI to analyze existing code. Two, you can use GenAI to reverse engineer tests to test what the code does. And then three, you can use GenAI to build new code and then users test it to ensure that the new code produces the same results as the old code. And so all that time and effort is suddenly cut in a meaningful way and that's suddenly creating a lot of interest from customers saying, my goodness. And if you're already on a relational app, moving to another relational app doesn't feel like modernization. So, the other advantage is that moving to MongoDB gives them a much more modern platform, a much more agile, flexible, performant, and scalable platform for their future needs. And that's why we're so excited. Again, it's early days. We've run a number of pilots that have gone well. We're in the process of working with some customers now in the migration process. This will take time because these are very, very complex applications. And actually, one thing I also mentioned was that they're not just going after -- saying go after some tertiary Tier 2 or Tier 3 application, they're saying, hey, we want you to look at some of our crown jewels because these are the apps that are most painful for us. So that's also very exciting. But again, this will take time, but we're very committed to this, and we think this is going to drive -- help us drive long-term -- meaningful long-term growth. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, Will. And to the last part of your question on the professional services investment, we're really building out that capacity in order to meet the demand that we're seeing relative to the opportunity. We're calling it in particular because it has a gross margin impact because that's where that will typically show up. And then maybe the last thing and it's probably obvious, but just to sort of underscore it is the reason we're doing this though is for the ARR, right, to drive the new workloads, the additional workloads over to MongoDB as part of that migration. And over time, as we've talked about before, we hope and expect to be able to leverage technology more and more, but at least initially and into the medium-term, there's going to be a healthy human/services component to that. Just wanted to sort of effectively telegraph that out to folks. William Power -- Analyst That's helpful. Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Will. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Rudy Kessinger of DA Davidson. Please go ahead. Rudy Kessinger -- Analyst Hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in here. I believe last quarter you said consumption growth slightly ahead of expectations. And while down slower year-over-year growth versus Q2 last year, the year-over-year growth did improve from Q1. And so, I guess I'm curious for Q3, could you make a comment in that same regard? Obviously, slower on a year-over-year basis than Q3 last year, but was it stable with year-over-year consumption growth in Q2 or better or worse? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Rudy, thanks for the question. We haven't specifically called that out relative to Q2. We did see a lower year-over-year growth as we called out. We did see a seasonal rebound. Usually Q3 is stronger than Q2 and we talked about how that was smaller than in the prior year. So hopefully, that will help you all triangulate. Rudy Kessinger -- Analyst Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. I believe it was on your Q4 call back in March. At that point, Dev, you said it would be at least another year until AI applications are being deployed at scale. It sounds like the commentary that some early large workloads, but out of the thousands, just not many that are at large scale. I guess, is your expectation now that maybe it's still at least another year until we're seeing broad AI application rollouts at scale? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I think a lot of it's a function of the what's happening in the R&D side of AI, right? So for example, today, we don't have a very compelling model designed for our phones, right, because today the phones don't have the computing horsepower to run complex models. So, you don't see a ton of very, very successful consumer apps besides, say, ChatGPT or Claude. So we don't -- we also don't see like hundreds of apps taking off like you saw kind of the first generation of like the Internet or the cloud era, right, or the mobile era. So like I think we're still in the early days of AI. And so while we see a lot of people building AI apps, a lot of them have kind of fairly rudimentary functionality. But I think that over time that's going to change. In fact, I know it will change. I just can't predict when that will happen. But where we do see apps having production, we are having traction, we're seeing them grow very, very quickly and we have a lot of them on our platform. It's just very few of them are really have meaningful. Operator Thank you. And that concludes today's Q&A session. I would like to go ahead and turn the call back over to Dev for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, everyone. I just wanted to say we're really pleased with our Q3 results with strong new business performance and revenue exceeding expectations both -- across both Atlas and EA. We're making the necessary investments to expand our enterprise channel where we see the largest opportunity to establish MongoDB as a standard and the strongest returns on our go-to-market investments. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the progress we're making on both accelerating legacy app modernization with AI as well as establishing ourselves as a standard of the emerging AI tech stack for greenfield AI applications. And last but not least, I would like to thank Michael again for his contributions over the past 10 years and wish him well. Thank you, everyone, and we'll talk to you soon.

including professional services. believe org structure best enable u execute key strategic initiative discussed earlier, particular, increased focus up-market app monetization opportunity. would like congratulate cedric well-deserved promotion. that, let turn call michael. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer thanks, dev, thanks kind word incredible partnership past decade. past 10 year rewarding professional career extremely proud achieved together course, whole mongodb team. much success had, still believe mongodb early stage realizing full potential continues take share one largest market software. now, turning result quarter. begin detailed review third-quarter result finish outlook fourth quarter full fiscal year 2025. first, start third quarter results. total revenue quarter $529.4 million, 22% year-over-year high end guidance. shifting product mix, atlas grew 26% quarter compared previous year represents 68% total revenue compared 66% third quarter fiscal 2024 71% last quarter. recognized atlas revenue primarily based customer consumption platform consumption closely tied end user activity applications. let provide context atlas consumption quarter. q3, consumption slightly ahead expectations. year's q3 seasonal improvement muted year past expected. year-over-year basis, consumption growth remains prior year period. turning non-atlas revenue. non-atlas came significantly ahead expectations. dev mentioned, ea new business strong, continue success selling incremental workload existing customer base. addition, q3 non-atlas revenue benefited large multi-year deals. know, due asc 606, recognized entire term license component multi-year contract start contract. compared q3 last year, multi-year license component non-atlas revenue $15 million higher. turning customer growth. third quarter, grew customer base approximately 1,900 customer sequentially, bringing total customer count 52,600, 46,400 year-ago period. total customer count, 7,400 direct sale customers, compare 6,900 year-ago period. growth total customer count driven primarily atlas, 51,100 customer end quarter compared 44,900 year-ago period. important keep mind growth atlas customer count reflects new customer mongodb addition existing ea customer adding first atlas workload. continuing on, q3, net arr expansion rate approximately 120%. ended quarter 2,314 customer least $100,000 arr annualized mrr, $1,972 year-ago period. moving income statement, discussing result non-gaap basis unless otherwise noted. gross profit third quarter $405.7 million, representing gross margin 77%, flat versus year-ago period. income operation $101.5 million 19% operating margin third quarter compared 18% operating margin year-ago period. primary reason favorable operating income result versus guidance revenue outperformance, including high margin multi-year license revenue benefit. net income third quarter $98.1 million $1.16 per share, based 84.2 million diluted weighted average share outstanding. compare net income $79.1 million $0.96 per share 83.7 million diluted weighted-average share outstanding year-ago period. turning balance sheet cash flow, ended third quarter $2.3 billion cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash. operating cash flow third quarter $37.4 million. taking consideration approximately $2.9 million capital expenditure principal repayment finance lease liabilities, free cash flow $34.6 million quarter. compare free cash flow $35 million year-ago period. q3, incur capital expenditure purchase ipv4 address previously expected, start making purchase november still expect total outlay $20 million $25 million fiscal year previously communicated. like turn outlook fourth quarter full fiscal year 2025. fourth quarter, expect revenue range $515 million $519 million. expect non-gaap income operation range $55 million $58 million non-gaap net income per share range $0.62 $0.65 based 84.9 million estimated diluted weighted-average share outstanding. full-fiscal year 2025, expect revenue range $1.973 billion $1.977 billion, non-gaap income operation range $242 million $245 million, non-gaap net income per share range $3.01 $3.03 based 84 million estimated diluted weighted-average share outstanding. note non-gaap net income per share guidance fourth-quarter full-fiscal year 2025 includes non-gaap tax provision approximately 20%. provide context around updated guidance. first, term atlas consumption, expect see typical seasonal slowdown q4, driven underlying application usage moderating holiday season. second, since atlas consumption remained lower year-over-year basis q3, expect see continued deceleration atlas year-over-year growth q4. third, expect see sequential decline non-atlas revenue q4, contrary normal pattern. reason experienced significant additional benefit multi-year deal q3, expect recur q4. addition, want provide incremental color recent product -- recent product go-to-market change impact growth reported customer count going forward. first, dev explained, reallocating portion go-to-market resource mid-market enterprise channel. result, expect see significantly fewer mid-market direct sale customer net addition result, slower direct sale customer growth going forward. believe reallocation investment dollar drive higher revenue growth time. so, trade-off make sense. second, introduce atlas flex cluster q4 automatically migrate customer q1, expect see one-time negative impact customer count since approximately 4,000 serverless customer low spending expect transition flex. customer negligible impact revenue impact reported customer count. summarize, pleased third quarter result especially ability win new business. small share one largest fastest-growing market software number secular tailwinds, including ai back. continue investing judiciously focusing execution capture long-term opportunity. that, like open questions. operator? question & answers: operator [operator instructions] first question day coming sanjit singh morgan stanley. line open. sanjit singh -- analyst thank taking question congrats, michael, outstanding career. absolutely fantastic run mongodb. excited see next, excited take breather. congrats, michael. guess take question -- start questions, look atlas past two quarters, correct wrong, think consumption coming least modestly ahead expectations. relative seen beginning year, sort -- function sale execution? function end-user activity sort improving? what's driving least improvement atlas consumption past two quarters? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. different things. think look outlook beginning year, indicated thought would see stable atlas growth consumption standpoint. seen talked -- actually seen lower year-over-year growth based underlying consumption. -- that's incorporated q4 guide. seen q3 q4 -- sorry, q2 q3, excuse me, better expectations, still year-over-year basis. want make sure sort confusing comparative set year-over-year versus relative expectations. sanjit singh -- analyst understood. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer core it, sanjit, question really underlying usage applications. sanjit singh -- analyst yeah, make total sense. then, dev, ask ai agent question. term ai agent needing context, going set tool take actions. mean mongodb operational data store customer start roll agentic applications? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. so, talk agents, think think agents, there's jobs, there's -- sorry, there's job, there's project there's task. right now, agent rolled really focused task like say something sierra company rolling agents. right, deemed deal able create rich complex data structures. important ai ai model look isolated data points, need understand relationships, hierarchies, pattern within data. need able essentially get real-time insights. example, chatbot someone querying, customer kind trying get update order placed five minute ago may gotten confirmation, chatbot need able deal real-time information. need able deal basically handling advanced use cases, understanding like, thing like fraud detection understand behavior supply chains, need understand intricate data relationships. thing consistent mongodb offers. believe end day, well-positioned handle this. thing would say embedded natural way search vector search. oltp database, tech search vector search. that's one experience platform offer that, think real advantage. integrated leading ai framework platforms. enterprise-grade security compliance, customer run u anywhere, either 118 cloud region on-prem, huge differentiator us. sanjit singh -- analyst awesome. appreciate thoughts, dev. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, sanjit. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line taylor -- tyler radke citi. line open. tyler radke -- analyst hi, thank much taking question. and, michael, best, congratulation 10 years. going back sale execution, mean, one thing talked earlier year challenge term recently acquired workload ramping. think lot past fiscal year. curious quality workload acquisition trended year. think ramp consumption potential next year, sort look versus time year ago? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. maybe talk change made michael talk little bit consumption trends. so, make change beginning year, really wanted focus volume quality workload slight adjustment made. think change reasonable positive impact. again, early declare victory workload usually start small grow time, really pleased result seeing far. -- again, early days. obviously, know fiscal '25 workload go fiscal '26. far, good. michael, consumption? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, couple things, thanks, tyler. fiscal '24 cohort called earlier, slower growth continue. line revised expectations. made change talked -- earlier year affect fiscal '25 cohorts, early tell. those, need quarter data really see -- seeing behave differently. say talked new business environment success new business. pleased that, show kind initial piece, need see grow cohort evolve. tyler radke -- analyst great. thanks. follow-up ea side, talked outsized strength non-atlas business quarter. maybe could unpack like relative upside driven simply duration versus new business. know called duration impact year-over-year, -- feel like sort one-off feel like maybe bigger customer indexing toward ea impact way think product introducing thing like vector search stream processing onto on-prem product? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah, thank you. overall, continue find ea product resonate customers. important part run anywhere strategy continued see success people wanting increase investment mongodb. there's always multiyear component continue see that. talked beginning year fiscal '24 abnormally high amount multi-year benefit therefore, anticipating headwind quantified roughly $40 million range. talked call earlier saw large accounts, surprising amount multiyear positively benefited q3 little $15 million revenue compared saw q3 year ago. so, much headwind expecting. obviously, 606 dynamics, things, especially large deal kind meaty chunky lumpy, try call sort help people understand, there's pretty healthy kind baseline flow, ea, also multiyear. see spikes, try call you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. want add, tyler, investing call ea business. first, starting investing search vector search community product. couple thing us. one, whenever anyone start mongodb open-source product, immediately get benefit complete highly integrated platform. two, capability migrate ea. so, ea u investment strategy. definitely see lot large customer very, committed running workload on-prem. even see customer want run run ai workload on-prem. so, optionality get using mongodb on-prem cloud, also cross-cloud compelling one. tyler radke -- analyst thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line brad reback stifel. line open. brad reback -- analyst great. thanks much. and, michael, best luck. great run. dev, started call talking bunch investments, great given growth business. obviously, talked reallocating expenses. net-net, think incremental investment phase next year gating margin upside? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer think that's something obviously ready talk next year now, would say -- reason looking invest summarize again, going up-market legacy app modernization see large workload potentially play ideal database genai apps, future important investment drive long-term growth. quite energized investment that's something high conviction on. brad reback -- analyst that's great. maap program, workload going wind atlas healthy combination ea atlas? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer think early days. would say -- would probably say side atlas ea early days. think introduce search vector search ea product, see on-prem. obviously, people use mongodb ai workload using technology well conjunction mongodb on-prem ai use cases. would say probably going see happen first atlas. brad reback -- analyst great. thanks much. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line jason ader william blair. line open. jason ader -- analyst yeah, thank you. going belabor congratulating michael, fun working best luck. question strength ea. think, dev, represents comment enterprise might rethinking reassessing kind on-prem versus cloud workload placement decision? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer well, think large enterprises, think large enterprise meaningful workload still running on-prem. think belief everything would go cloud probably something really popular good old day zurp. think customer assess investment already place, much judicious run workload think leverage existing investment infrastructure, going so. also bunch reason like regulatory reasons, customer quite moving aggressively cloud. see particularly europe, see lot european bank still running majority workload on-prem. also varies region conversely asia, seeing people much move much aggressively cloud. think really depends industry, geography, personal dynamic what's happening particular account. mean, see large u bank also committed running thing on-prem. really varies. that's feel really good run anywhere strategy give customer optionality. build something run on-prem. choose move cloud, easy mongodb. jason ader -- analyst right. follow-up also investment making strategic sale enterprise. could get little specific investment might be? hiring lot new salespeople? working sis, investing sis? additional detail would helpful. thanks. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. everyone's benefit, identified number accounts, call strategic accounts, think high upside us. seen number account grow quickly deploy right mix resources. necessarily quota-carrying resources. could additional technical sale resources, additional p resources, additional customer service resource better service support accounts. even thing like run education session developer accounts, called either hackathons like call developer day even design review meet development team looking build application, help think would potentially use mongodb build particular app. find many developers, experience mongodb quite limited, engage them, educate show simple easy is. like example, customer today think like use oltp database, search database, maybe vector database, like caching database. integrated mongodb. sudden, customer say, wow, simplify life, simplify back-end infrastructure, build app far quickly much easier manage long-term everything mongodb. really function educating power mongodb really open lot opportunity us. that's doubling down, mix resource really predicated accounts, quota counting resources, whole suite resource bringing table. jason ader -- analyst thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line andrew nowinski well fargo. line open. andrew nowinski -- analyst okay. good afternoon. thank much taking question congrats nice quarter. gave example customer migrated postgres think said issue pg vector function. wondering long customer using postgres decided make change mongo, meaning sort like rebound type customer chose pg -- excuse me, postgres work? frequently seeing type transition? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. can't give specific long using postgres, -- trend seeing business. remember postgres 40-year-old technology. -- beneficiary people lifting shifting type relational databases, oracle, sql server, mysql, et cetera. open-source database. part -- open-source relational database, inherent challenge relational database do. quite inflexible. build schema, hard change schema. hard scale hard distribute data. large data volumes, weird thing like, example, resort off-road storage large data objects, creates performance bottlenecks. again, people default postgres know anything better know relational everyone kind moving relational platforms. that's whole point saying earlier. educate developer flexibility schema, easily horizontally scale rich query language aggregation sophisticated geospatial indexes, productivity gain using document model easy organize data, -- people like, wow, life much easier. want clear, zero-sum game. postgres fail u successful. big market quite excited opportunity, see customer moving postgres coming mongodb. andrew nowinski -- analyst thank you. helpful. maybe quick follow-up. normalize $15 million multiyear deal impact q3, would ea still sequentially q4? thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer given level guidance, trying help understand context full-year number headwind talked beginning year, given strength saw q3. andrew nowinski -- analyst got it. thanks. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question

significantly reduce time. one, use genai analyze existing code. two, use genai reverse engineer test test code does. three, use genai build new code user test ensure new code produce result old code. time effort suddenly cut meaningful way that's suddenly creating lot interest customer saying, goodness. already relational app, moving another relational app feel like modernization. so, advantage moving mongodb give much modern platform, much agile, flexible, performant, scalable platform future needs. that's excited. again, early days. run number pilot gone well. process working customer migration process. take time very, complex applications. actually, one thing also mentioned going -- saying go tertiary tier 2 tier 3 application, saying, hey, want look crown jewel apps painful us. that's also exciting. again, take time, committed this, think going drive -- help u drive long-term -- meaningful long-term growth. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer

Welcome to the MongoDB third-quarter fiscal year 2025 conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there'll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your speaker for today, Brian Denyeau. Please go ahead. Brian Raferty Denyeau -- Investor Relations Thank you, Lisa. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today to review MongoDB's third-quarter fiscal 2025 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued after the close of the market today. Joining me the call today are Dev Ittycheria, president and CEO of MongoDB; and Michael Gordon, MongoDB's COO and CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our market and future growth opportunities, our expectations for the macroeconomic environment in fiscal 2025 and the impact of AI, the benefits of our product platform, our competitive landscape, customer behaviors, our financial guidance, and our planned investments in growth opportunities in AI. These statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including the results of operations and financial condition that cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. For a discussion of the material risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please refer to the risks described in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 31st, 2024 that we filed with the SEC on August 30th, 2024. Any forward-looking statements made on this call reflect our views only as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them except as required by law. Additionally, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures on this conference call. Please refer to the tables in our earnings release in the Investor Relations portion of our website for a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dev. Dev? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we had a strong quarter of new business and executed well against our large market opportunity. Let's begin by reviewing our third quarter results before giving you a broader company update. We generated revenue of $529 million, a 22% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew 26% year-over-year, representing 68% of total revenue. We generated non-GAAP operating income of $101 million for a 19% non-GAAP operating margin and we ended the quarter with over 52,600 customers. Overall, we were pleased with our performance in the third quarter. We had a strong new business quarter and we're happy with our new workload acquisition on Atlas. Our non-Atlas business significantly exceeded expectations in part because we benefited from a few large multi-year deals as customers continue to value our run anywhere strategy and want to build a deeper longer-term relationship with MongoDB. Atlas consumption was slightly better than expected in a macro-environment that we would characterize as largely consistent with what we saw in the first half of the year. Michael will cover consumption trends in more detail. Retention rates remained strong in Q3, demonstrating the mission criticality of our platform. On our Q1 earnings call, we shared with you the three major strategic initiatives that we believe will enable us to maximize our long-term opportunity. I want to give you an update on the progress we're making on those initiatives. First, we are increasing our investment in the enterprise channel since we see the strongest returns in this part of the market. Specifically, we're expanding our strategic account program going to next year, as we see more accounts that will benefit from incremental investment. In addition, we're investing time and resources to educate developers in large enterprise accounts and uplevel their MongoDB skills. These organizations have thousands of developers and as we penetrate them more deeply, we encounter developers who have historically only built SQL applications and simply do not know how to use MongoDB to its full potential. In our experience, educating these developers on the benefits of MongoDB drives significant incremental adoption of our platform. To fund these up-market investments, we are reallocating a portion of our mid-market investments. The mid-market remains an attractive opportunity for us, but we believe that prioritizing investment up-market will deliver strong returns in the current environment. We also believe there are additional ways to serve the mid-market more efficiently through our self-serve channel and other scaled technology-enabled sales and customer service motions. Second, we are optimistic about the opportunity to accelerate legacy app modernization using AI and are investing more in this area. As you recall, we ran a few successful pilots earlier this year, demonstrating that AI tooling combined with professional services and our relational migrator product can significantly reduce the time, cost, and risk of migrating legacy applications onto MongoDB. While it's early days, we have observed a more than 50% reduction in the cost to modernize. On the back of these strong early results, additional customer interest is exceeding our expectations. Large enterprises in every industry and geography are experiencing acute pain from their legacy infrastructure and are eager for more agile, performant, and cost-effective solutions. Not only are customers excited to engage with us, they also want to focus on some of the most important applications in their enterprise, further demonstrating the level of interest and size of the long-term opportunity. As relational applications encompass a wide variety of database types, programming languages, versions, and other customer-specific variables, we expect modernization projects to continue to include meaningful service engagements in the short and medium term. Consequently, we're increasing our professional services delivery capabilities, both directly and through partners. In the long run, we expect to automate and simplify large parts of the modernization process. To that end, we are leveraging the learnings from early service engagement to develop new tools to accelerate future modernization efforts. Although it's early days and scaling our legacy app modernization capabilities will take time, we have increased conviction that this motion will significantly add to our growth in the long term. Third, we are investing to capitalize on our inherent technical advantages as a key component of the emerging AI tech stack. As a reminder, MongoDB is uniquely equipped to query rich and complex data structures typical of AI applications. The ability of a database to query rich and complex data structures is crucial because AI applications often rely on highly detailed, interrelated, and nuanced data to make accurate predictions and decisions. For example, a recommendation system doesn't just analyze a single customer's purchase but also considers their browsing history, peer group behavior, and product categories requiring a database that can query and interlink these complex data structures. In addition, MongoDB's architecture unifies source data, metadata, operational data, and vector data in an all-in-one platform, updating the need for multiple database systems and complex back-end architectures. This enables a more compelling developer experience than any other alternative. From what we see in the AI market today, most customers are still in the experimental stage as they work to understand the effectiveness of the underlying tech stack and build early proof-of-concept applications. However, we are seeing an increasing number of AI apps in production. Today, we have thousands of AI apps on our platform. What we don't yet see is many of these apps actually achieving meaningful product market fit and therefore significant traction. In fact, as you take a step back and look at the entire universe of AI apps, a very small percentage of them have achieved the type of scale that we commonly see with enterprise-specific applications. We do have some AI apps that are growing quickly, including one that is already a seven-figure workload that has grown 10 times since the beginning of the year. Similar to prior platform shifts as the usefulness of AI tech improves and becomes more cost-effective, we will see the emergence of many more AI apps that do nail product market fit, but it's difficult to predict when that will happen more broadly. We remain confident that we will capture our fair share of these successful AI applications as we see that our platform is popular with developers building more sophisticated AI use cases. We continue investing in our product capabilities, including enterprise-grade Atlas Vector Search functionality to build on this momentum and even better position MongoDB to capture the AI opportunity. In addition, as previously announced, we are bringing search and vector service to our community and EA offerings, leveraging our run anywhere competitive advantage in the world of AI. Finally, we are expanding our MongoDB AI applications program or MAAP, which helps enterprise customers build and bring AI applications into production by providing them with reference architectures, integrations with leading tech providers, and coordinated services and support. Last week, we announced a new code of partners including McKinsey, Confluent, Capgemini, and Unstructured, as well as the collaboration with Meta to enable developers to build AI-enriched applications on MongoDB using Llama. Next, I'd like to provide you with a brief product update. At our dot local developer conference in London in October, we announced the general availability of MongoDB 8.0, the fastest and most performant version of MongoDB ever. MongoDB 8.0 performs 20% to 60% better against common industry benchmarks compared to our prior version and is built to exceed our customers' most stringent security, resiliency, availability, and performance requirements. To best serve our customers, we regularly review and reprioritize investments in our product portfolio to ensure we're allocating our resources to products with the highest demand from our customers. And to do that, we also deprecate products that are not showing results we desired. Consequently, we made the decision to consolidate our Atlas serverless offerings with our smallest dedicated tiers to create Atlas Flex customers, a new offering with a simpler architecture that provides the elasticity features akin to serverless. We will begin migrating effective customers to the single, simple, entry-level solution in Q4. We also decided to deprecate Atlas DeviceSync and other capabilities not widely adopted in order to focus our engineering resources on the core platform. While these reprioritization decisions are not made lightly, they allow us to deliver the most value to the largest number of customers, reinforcing our commitment to being the best modern database and helping us to grow faster. Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the adoption trends of MongoDB across our customer base. Customers across industries and around the world are running mission-critical projects in MongoDB Atlas, leveraging the full power of our developer data platform, including Financial Times, CarGurus, and Victoria's Secret. As part of the digital transformation journey, global specialty retailer Victoria's Secret & Company migrated its e-commerce platform to MongoDB Atlas. As a fully managed platform, MongoDB Atlas allowed the company to simplify its architecture and improve performance, supporting the retailer to provide a resilient, secure, and fast web and mobile e-commerce experience for their millions of customers around the world. Allianz, Alphamad, Swiss Post, and Paylocity are turning to MongoDB to modernize applications. Paylocity, a leading provider of cloud-based payroll and human capital management software, selected MongoDB to power proprietary application aimed at fostering employee connections and engagement. When traffic increased and the original SQL-based solution was unable to keep up with the required performance metrics, Paylocity migrated to MongoDB Atlas to take advantage of the flexible schema architecture, performance, and scalability. MongoDB costs five times less than the previous SQL database solution and the company's developers can now create an application within minutes, something that used to take weeks. Mature companies and start-ups alike are using MongoDB to help deliver the next wave of AI-powered application to customers, including NerdWallet, Cisco, and Tealbook. Tealbook, a supplier intelligence platform, migrated from Postgres, pgvector, and ElasticSearch to MongoDB to eliminate technical debt and consolidate their tech stack. The company experienced workload isolation and scalability issues in pgvector and were concerned with the search index inconsistencies, which were all resolved with the migration to MongoDB. With Atlas Vector search and dedicated search nodes, Tealbook has realized improved cost-efficiency and increased scalability for the supplier data platform, an application that uses GenAI to collect, verify, and enrich supplier data across various sources. In summary, we had a healthy Q3 with both Atlas and EA exceeding expectations. We saw a strong new business quarter and we remain confident in our ability to become an increasing strategic provider in our large and growing market. Looking forward, we see a great opportunity to grow our adoption in the enterprise through new workloads, modernizing legacy applications, and winning the next generation of AI-powered applications. I would like to finish by providing an update on our senior leadership. First, as we announced early in the press release, after nearly 10 years, Michael Gordon has made the decision to leave MongoDB. Michael has been instrumental in MongoDB's success over the past decade, leading our successful IPO, helping us grow our revenue nearly 50-fold, and scaling -- and successfully scaling our business model to generate meaningful operating leverage. He has been a trusted advisor and business partner to the Board and me over the years and also has become a personal friend. Michael is excited to take a well-deserved break. We have commenced the search for Michael's replacement and will be evaluating both internal and external candidates. One of Michael's proudest compliments -- accomplishments has been building a world-class finance team under his leadership, and I'm confident that we will not miss a beat during this transition. Michael will continue to serve as CFO through January 31st to help us finish the fiscal year and then will transition to an Advisor to the company to ensure a seamless process. If we have not named Michael's successor by fiscal year-end, Serge Tanjga, SVP of Finance, will serve as Interim CFO, beginning on February 1st. Second, we are promoting Cedric Pech, currently our chief revenue officer to the newly created role of president worldwide field operations. In this new position, Cedric will oversee all our field-based customer-facing and go-to-market enablement teams, including professional services. We believe this org structure will best enable us to execute on some of the key strategic initiatives I discussed earlier, in particular, our increased focus on up-market and the app monetization opportunity. I would like to congratulate Cedric on this well-deserved promotion. With that, let me turn the call over to Michael. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Dev, and thanks for the kind words and our incredible partnership over the past decade. The past 10 years have been the most rewarding in my professional career and I'm extremely proud of what we've achieved together and of course, to the whole MongoDB team. With as much success as we had, I still believe that MongoDB is in the early stages of realizing its full potential as it continues to take share in one of the largest markets in software. Now, turning to the results for the quarter. I'll begin with a detailed review of our third-quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025. First, I'll start with our third quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $529.4 million, up 22% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance. Shifting to our product mix, Atlas grew 26% in the quarter compared to the previous year and now represents 68% of total revenue compared to 66% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and 71% last quarter. We recognized Atlas revenue primarily based on customer consumption of our platform and that consumption is closely tied to end user activity of their applications. Let me provide some context on Atlas consumption in the quarter. In Q3, consumption was slightly ahead of our expectations. This year's Q3 seasonal improvement was more muted than in years past as expected. On a year-over-year basis, consumption growth remains below that of prior year period. Turning to non-Atlas revenue. Non-Atlas came in significantly ahead of our expectations. As Dev mentioned, EA new business was strong, and we continue to have success selling incremental workloads into our existing customer base. In addition, our Q3 non-Atlas revenue benefited from a few large multi-year deals. As you know, due to ASC 606, we recognized the entire term license component of a multi-year contract at the start of that contract. Compared to Q3 of last year, the multi-year license component of non-Atlas revenues was over $15 million higher. Turning to customer growth. During the third quarter, we grew our customer base by approximately 1,900 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 52,600, which is up from over 46,400 in the year-ago period. Of our total customer count, over 7,400 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 6,900 in the year-ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven primarily by Atlas, which had over 51,100 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 44,900 in the year-ago period. It is important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers adding their first Atlas workload. Continuing on, in Q3, our net ARR expansion rate was approximately 120%. We ended the quarter with 2,314 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, up from $1,972 in the year-ago period. Moving down the income statement, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the third quarter was $405.7 million, representing a gross margin of 77%, which is flat versus the year-ago period. Our income from operations was $101.5 million or 19% operating margin for the third quarter compared to an 18% operating margin in the year-ago period. The primary reason for more favorable operating income results versus guidance is our revenue outperformance, including the very high margin multi-year license revenue benefit. Net income in the third quarter was $98.1 million or $1.16 per share, based on 84.2 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a net income of $79.1 million or $0.96 per share on 83.7 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding in the year-ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the third quarter with $2.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $37.4 million. After taking into consideration approximately $2.9 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was $34.6 million in the quarter. This compares to free cash flow of $35 million in the year-ago period. In Q3, we did not incur capital expenditures to purchase IPV4 addresses as we previously expected, but we did start making those purchases in November and still expect a total outlay of $20 million to $25 million this fiscal year as we previously communicated. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $515 million to $519 million. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $55 million to $58 million and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.65 based on 84.9 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. For the full-fiscal year 2025, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.973 billion to $1.977 billion, non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $242 million to $245 million, and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $3.01 to $3.03 based on 84 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. Note that the non-GAAP net income per share guidance for the fourth-quarter and full-fiscal year 2025 includes a non-GAAP tax provision of approximately 20%. I'll now provide some more context around our updated guidance. First, in terms of Atlas consumption, we expect to see a typical seasonal slowdown in Q4, driven by underlying application usage moderating during the holiday season. Second, since Atlas consumption remained lower on a year-over-year basis in Q3, we expect to see continued deceleration of Atlas year-over-year growth in Q4. Third, we expect to see a sequential decline in non-Atlas revenue in Q4, which is contrary to our normal pattern. The reason for this is that we experienced a significant additional benefit from multi-year deals in Q3, which we do not expect to recur in Q4. In addition, I want to provide some incremental color on some of our recent product and -- how some of our recent product and go-to-market changes will impact the growth of our reported customer count going forward. First, as Dev explained, we are reallocating a portion of our go-to-market resources from the mid-market to the enterprise channel. As a result, we expect to see significantly fewer mid-market direct sales customer net additions and as a result, slower direct sales customer growth going forward. We believe this reallocation of investment dollars will drive higher revenue growth over time. So, it's a trade-off that makes sense. Second, as we introduce Atlas Flex clusters in Q4 and automatically migrate customers in Q1, we expect to see a one-time negative impact to our customer count since we have approximately 4,000 serverless customers who are very low spending and we do not expect them to transition over to Flex. These customers have a negligible impact on our revenue but will impact our reported customer count. To summarize, we're pleased with our third quarter results and especially our ability to win new business. We have a small share in one of the largest and fastest-growing markets in all of software with a number of secular tailwinds, including AI at our back. We'll continue investing judiciously and focusing on our execution to capture this long-term opportunity. With that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator? Questions & Answers: Operator [Operator instructions] Our first question for the day will be coming from Sanjit Singh of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Thank you for taking the questions and congrats, Michael, on outstanding career. You had an absolutely fantastic run at MongoDB. I'm excited to see what you do next, or excited if you just take a breather. So congrats, Michael. I guess to take the question -- to start off with the questions, when we look at what Atlas has been doing in the past two quarters, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think consumption is coming in at least modestly ahead of your expectations. Relative to what we've seen at the beginning of the year, what sort of -- is it a function of sales execution? Is it a function of the end-user activity sort of improving? What's driving at least the improvement in Atlas consumption in the past two quarters? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So a few different things. So I think if you look at our outlook at the beginning of the year, we had indicated that we thought we would see stable Atlas growth from a consumption standpoint. What we've seen and what we've talked about is -- we've actually seen lower year-over-year growth based on the underlying consumption. And so -- and that's incorporated into our Q4 guide. We have seen the Q3 and Q4 be -- sorry, Q2 and Q3, excuse me, be better than our expectations, but it's still down on a year-over-year basis. And so I want to make sure that we're not sort of confusing the comparative set of year-over-year versus relative to our expectations. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Understood. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer And the core of it, Sanjit, to your question is really the underlying usage of the applications. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Yeah, that makes total sense. And then, Dev, I have to ask you the AI agent question. In terms of an AI agent needing more context, it has going to have a set of tools to take its actions. What does it mean for MongoDB as an operational data store as customers start to roll out more agentic applications? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, just to talk about agents, I think when you think about agents, there's jobs, there's -- sorry, there's a job, there's projects and then there's task. Right now, the agents that are being rolled out are really focused on task like say something from Sierra or some other companies are rolling out agents. But you're right, what they deemed to do is to deal with being able to create a rich and complex data structures. Now why is this important for AI is that AI models don't just look at isolated data points, but they need to understand relationships, hierarchies, and patterns within the data. They need to be able to essentially get real-time insights. For example, if you have a chatbot where someone is querying, a customer is kind of trying to get some update on the order they placed five minutes ago because they may have not gotten any confirmation, your chatbot needs to be able to deal with real-time information. You need to be able to deal with basically handling very advanced use cases, understanding like, to do things like fraud detection to understand behaviors of supply chains, you need to understand intricate data relationships. All these things are consistent with MongoDB offers. And so we believe that at the end of the day, we are well-positioned to handle this. And the other thing that I would say is that we've embedded in a very natural way of search and vector search. So we're just not an OLTP database, we do tech search and vector search. That's all one experience and no other platform offers that, and we think we have a real advantage. And so we're integrated with the leading AI frameworks and platforms. We have enterprise-grade security and compliance, and customers can run us anywhere, either on 118 cloud regions or on-prem, and that again is a huge differentiator for us. Sanjit Singh -- Analyst Awesome. Appreciate the thoughts, Dev. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Sanjit. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Taylor -- Tyler Radke of Citi. Your line is open. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Hi, thank you very much for taking the question. And, Michael, all the best, and congratulations on 10 years. Going back to the sales execution, I mean, one of the things that you talked about earlier this year was some challenges just in terms of the recently acquired workloads ramping. And I think a lot of those were from the past fiscal year. So curious how the quality of workload acquisition has trended this year. And as you think about the ramp in consumption potential into next year, how does that sort of look versus this time a year ago? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Maybe I'll just talk about what we're doing and the changes we made and then Michael can talk a little bit about the consumption trends. So, we did make some changes at the beginning of the year, and we really wanted to focus on both the volume and the quality of the workloads and there were some slight adjustments that we made. We think those changes are having a reasonable positive impact. Again, it's too early to declare victory because these workloads usually start small and grow over time, but we're really pleased with the results we're seeing so far. And -- but again, it's early days. And obviously, we'll know about the fiscal '25 workloads as we go into fiscal '26. But so far, so good. Michael, on consumption? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, just a couple of things, and thanks, Tyler. The fiscal '24 cohorts that we called out earlier, that slower growth does continue. They've been in line with our revised expectations. We made some changes that we talked about at the -- earlier in the year that should affect the fiscal '25 cohorts, but it's just too early to tell. On those, we need a few more quarters of data before you can really see if we're -- how we're seeing those behave differently. I will say we've talked about the new business environment and our success in new business. We have been pleased with that, but that just shows kind of the initial piece, and we need to see how they grow and how those cohorts evolve. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Great. Thanks. And follow-up on the EA side, you talked about the outsized strength in non-Atlas business this quarter. Maybe if you could unpack like the relative upside that was driven by simply duration versus new business. I know you called out the duration impact year-over-year, but are -- do you feel like this was sort of a one-off or do you feel like maybe some of your bigger customers are indexing more toward EA and how does that impact the way you think about the product and introducing things like vector search and stream processing onto the on-prem product? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, thank you. So overall, we continue to find the EA product resonate with customers. It's an important part of the run anywhere strategy and we've continued to see success with that and people wanting to increase their investment in MongoDB. There's always been a multiyear component and we continue to see that. We talked about that at the beginning of the year as to how fiscal '24 had an abnormally high amount of multi-year benefit and therefore, we were anticipating that being a headwind and we quantified that in roughly the $40 million range. What we talked about on this call earlier is we saw from a few large accounts, a surprising amount of multiyear that positively benefited Q3 at a little more than $15 million in revenue compared to what we saw Q3 a year ago. So, not as much of a headwind as we had been expecting. Obviously, with the 606 dynamics, some of these things, especially for a large deal can be kind of meaty and chunky and lumpy, which is why we try and call it out and sort of help people understand, but there's a pretty healthy kind of baseline flow, not just of EA, but also of multiyear. And when we see spikes, we just try and call it out for you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I just want to add, Tyler, that we are investing in our what we call our EA business. First, we're starting by investing with search and vector search and a community product. That does a couple of things for us. One, whenever anyone starts with MongoDB with the open-source product, they immediately get all the benefits of that complete highly integrated platform. Two, those capabilities will then migrate to EA. So, EA for us is an investment strategy. We definitely see lots of large customers who are very, very committed to running workloads on-prem. We even see some customers want to run to run AI workloads on-prem. So, the optionality they get by using MongoDB to not just be on-prem and the cloud, but also cross-cloud is a very compelling one. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Brad Reback of Stifel. Your line is open. Brad Reback -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. And, Michael, best of luck. It's been a great run. Dev, you started the call talking about a bunch of investments, which are great given the growth of the business. And obviously, you talked about reallocating some expenses. But net-net, should we think about this incremental investment phase next year as gating margin upside? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think that's something that we obviously are not ready to talk about next year just now, but I would say that we -- the reason we're looking to invest and just to summarize again, going up-market on legacy app modernization where we see very large workloads potentially at play and being the ideal database for GenAI apps, which is the future as important investments to drive long-term growth. And we're quite energized by those investments and that's something that we have high conviction on. Brad Reback -- Analyst That's great. And then on the MAAP program, are most of those workloads going to wind up in Atlas or will that be a healthy combination of EA and Atlas? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think it's again early days. I would say -- I would probably say more on the side of Atlas and EA in the early days. I think once we introduce a search and vector search into the EA product, you'll see more of that on-prem. Obviously, people can use MongoDB for AI workloads using other technologies as well in conjunction with MongoDB for on-prem AI use cases. But I would say you're probably going to see that happen first in Atlas. Brad Reback -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Jason Ader of William Blair. Your line is open. Jason Ader -- Analyst Yeah, thank you. I'm not going to belabor congratulating Michael, but it has been it has been fun working with you and best of luck. The question I had is on the strength in EA. Do you think, Dev, it represents a comment on how enterprises might be rethinking or reassessing the kind of on-prem versus cloud workload placement decision? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Well, when I think about large enterprises, I think large enterprises have meaningful workloads that are still running on-prem. I think the belief that everything would go to the cloud was probably something that was really popular in the good old days of Zurp. But I think now as customers assess their investments that they already have in place, they're being much more judicious about where they run those workloads and if they think they can leverage their existing investments in their own infrastructure, then they're going to do so. Also for a bunch of other reasons like regulatory reasons, some customers are quite not moving as aggressively to the cloud. We see that in particularly in Europe, where we see a lot of the European banks still running majority of the workloads on-prem. So it also varies by region where conversely in Asia, we're seeing people much move much more aggressively to the cloud. So I think it really depends on industry, on geography, and on the personal dynamics of what's happening in that particular account. I mean, we see some large US banks are also very committed to running things on-prem. So it really varies. And that's why we feel really good about our run anywhere strategy because it gives customer optionality. They can build something and run on-prem. And if and when they choose to move to the cloud, it's very easy to do so with MongoDB. Jason Ader -- Analyst All right. And then just as a follow-up also on the investments you're making in strategic sales and enterprise. Could you just get a little more specific on what those investments might be? Is it hiring a lot of new salespeople? Is it working more with SIs, investing more in SIs? Any additional detail would be helpful. Thanks. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So just for everyone's benefit, we've identified a number of accounts, which we call strategic accounts, which we think that have high upside for us. We've seen a number of accounts that grow very quickly when we deploy the right mix of resources. Now they're all not necessarily quota-carrying resources. They could be additional technical sales resources, additional PS resources, additional customer service resources to better service and support those accounts. We even do things like run education sessions for developers of the accounts, they're called either hackathons or like what we call developer days or even design reviews where we'll meet with our development teams who are looking to build an application, help them think about how they would potentially use MongoDB to build that particular app. And what we find is that because many of these developers, the experience with MongoDB is quite limited, the more we can engage with them, the more we can educate them and the more we can show them how simple and easy it is. Like for example, most customers today think like they have to use an OLTP database, then a search database, maybe a vector database, and then like a caching database. And all that is integrated in MongoDB. So all of a sudden, customers can say, wow, I can simplify my life, simplify my back-end infrastructure, build this app far more quickly and it will be much more easier to manage long-term if I do everything on MongoDB. And it's really a function of just educating them on the power of MongoDB that really opens up a lot of opportunities for us. So that's why we're doubling down, and the mix of resources is really predicated on the accounts, but it's not just quota counting resources, it's the whole suite of resources that we're bringing to the table. Jason Ader -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Andrew Nowinski of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Okay. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking the question and congrats on a nice quarter. You gave an example of a customer that migrated off Postgres and I think you said they had issues with their PG vector function. I was wondering how long was that customer using Postgres before they decided to make a change to Mongo, meaning was this some sort of like a rebound type customer where they chose PG -- or excuse me, Postgres and it didn't work? And then how frequently are you seeing this type of transition? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So I can't give you the specifics on how long they were using Postgres, but this is not -- this is a trend that we're seeing in our business. You have to remember Postgres is a 40-year-old technology. It's -- and they have been the beneficiary of people lifting and shifting from other types of relational databases, Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, et cetera. And they're an open-source database. And but as part -- because they're an open-source and relational database, they have the same inherent challenges all relational databases do. They're quite inflexible. So once you build a schema, it's very hard to change the schema. It's hard to scale and hard to distribute data. And if you have large data volumes, you have to do weird things like, for example, resort to off-road storage for large data objects, which creates performance bottlenecks. And so again, people default to Postgres if they don't know anything better because all they know is relational and everyone is kind of moving off those other relational platforms. And that's the whole point I was saying earlier. Once we educate developers on the flexibility of schema, how easily or horizontally scale the rich query language where you can do aggregations and do sophisticated geospatial indexes, the productivity gains by using the document model and how easy is to organize data, it's -- people are just like, wow, life is so much easier. Now I want to be clear, this is not a zero-sum game. Postgres does not have to fail for us to be successful. It's a big market and we're quite excited about the opportunity, but we do see customers moving off Postgres and coming to MongoDB. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Thank you. That was very helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up. If we normalize the $15 million multiyear deal impact you had in Q3, would EA still be down sequentially in Q4? Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer We haven't given that level of guidance, but just trying to help you understand in the context of the full-year numbers and the headwind that we talked about at the beginning of the year, just given the strength that we saw in Q3. Andrew Nowinski -- Analyst Got it. Thanks. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. The next question will be coming from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst Hey, thank you. And if you think about the EA strength this quarter, Michael, you'd kind of give us a little bit there. Like how should we think about renewal -- the renewal situation renewal pool coming up like or that you had in Q3, coming up in Q4, et cetera, as well and then like what does it mean in terms of upsell, cross-sell opportunity as people think about starting AI projects by self-serve, as you kind of mentioned earlier on the call? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So I think about -- if you think about EA for Q4, it tends to be a large renewal quarter, but what we're talking about in terms of the guide is because we had such strength in multiyear, that's where we would expect to see our EA down sequentially, which is not typically our pattern, which is why we called it out. In terms of AI workloads and some of those other things, I think it's early to tell and obviously, we'll continue to evolve and assess our view when we get to the full-year guide in March. And then we'll also have an updated view on how the cohorts are behaving and sort of how multiyear played out. But I think in terms of Q4, the comments that I made earlier hopefully will help. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst Yeah. Okay, perfect. And then the -- and can you talk a little bit about like obviously, there's a debate of like which database will be the persistent layer if you do AI projects, et cetera. What do you see from the big hyperscalers in terms of working with you guys and partnerships? We obviously just have AWS kind of summit, et-cetera. Can you speak a little bit like how your relationship with those big guys is evolving around this? And Michael, All the best in case I don't talk to you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, I'll start with the partnerships first, like our -- with AWS, as you said, they just had their re:Invent show last week. Our -- it remains very, very strong. We've closed a ton of deals this past quarter. Some of them very, very large deals. We're doing integrations to some of the new products like Q and Bedrock and the engagement in the field has been really strong. On Azure, I think we -- as I've shared in the past, we start-off with a little bit of a slow start, but in the words of the person who runs their partner leadership, the Azure MongoDB relationship has never been stronger. We've closed a large number of deals. We're part of what's called the Azure native IC service program and have a bunch of deep integrations with Azure, including Fabric, Power BI, Visual Studio, Semantic Kernel, and Azure OpenAI Studio. And we're also one of Azure's largest marketplace partners. And GCP does -- we have actually seen some uptick in terms of co-sales that we've done this past quarter and GCP made some comp changes where they -- that were favorable to working with MongoDB that we saw some results in the field, and we're focused on closing on -- closing a handful of large deals with GCP in Q4. So in general, I would say, things are going quite well. And then in terms of, I guess, implying your question was like the hyperscalers and are they potentially bundling things along with their AI offerings? I mean, candidly, since day one, the hyperscalers have been bundling their database offerings with every offering that they have and that's been their predominant strategy. And we've -- I think we've executed well against strategy because databases are not like a by-the-way decision. It's an important decision. And I think the hyperscalers are seeing our performance and realize it's better to partner with us. And as I said, customers understand the importance of the data layer, especially for AI applications. And so the partnership across all three hyperscalers is strong. Raimo Lenschow -- Analyst OK, perfect. Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Raimo. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. The next question will be coming from the line of Brad Sills of Bank of America. Your line is open. Brad Sills -- Analyst Great. Thank you so much, and congratulations, Michael, on your next move. I wanted to ask about new workloads here on vector search, stream processing, relational migrator. Is there any one of those three that's ramping faster than maybe you expected? Just a little bit of color on how those new workload types are ramping. Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I'll kind of give you just a rundown of some of the -- I mean, essentially you're asking about the new products, like our -- on search, we introduced a new capability called Atlas search nodes, which where you can asymmetrically scale your search nodes because if you have a search-intensive use case, you don't have to scale all your nodes because they have become quite expensive. And we've seen that this kind of groundbreaking capability really well received. The demand is quite high and because customers like they can tune the configuration to the unique needs of their search requirements. One of the world's largest banks is using Atlas Search to provide like a Google-like search experience on payments data for massive corporate customers. So this is a customer-facing application and so performance, and scalability are critical. A leading provider of AI-powered accounting software uses Atlas Search to power its invoice analytics future, which allows end users and finance teams to perform ad-hoc analysis and easily find past-due invoices and voices that contain errors. So that search -- on vector search, it -- again, and it's been our kind of our first full-year since going generally available. And the product uptake has been actually very, very high. In Q3, we released quantization for Atlas Vector Search, which reduces the memory requirements by up to 96%, allowing us to support larger vector workloads with vastly improved price performance. For example, a multinational news organization created a GenAI powered tool designed to help producers and journalists efficiently search, summarize, and verify information from vast and varied data sources. A leading security firm is using Atlas Vector Search to fight AI fraud and a leading global media company replaced elastic search with hybrid search and vector search use case for a user recommendation engine that's built to suggest -- that's built in to suggest articles to end users. And so that's super exciting to see as well. We're also seeing a lot of interest in our streaming product, demand is very high. We just rolled it out to another hyperscaler, and customers are commenting on that the use cases of being able to embed stream processing with MongoDB makes our life so much easier. So overall, we're quite pleased with the progress we're making on the new products. And as I said before, natively bundling all these capabilities really reduces or eliminates the need for customers to have to bolt on a bunch of different technologies to solve the same problem, saving them a lot of time, money, cost, and risk. Brad Sills -- Analyst That's really exciting. Thanks, Dev. And then I wanted to ask a question around Cedric's appointment. Any focus that may be different here under his leadership that we should be thinking about going forward? Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer No, Cedric has been our CRO for, gosh, now like I think like five, six years, and he -- I was the Interim CRO for about three quarters until he took over when we last made a change and this is really an expansion of his responsibilities. I've known Cedric for a long time. He and I have worked with at multiple different companies. I think I have a good barometer for understanding sales leadership. There's a number of sales leaders who worked at other top-tier software companies who used to work for me or with me. And so I'm super-excited by the role Cedric is going to take and then we're also making some changes under Cedric to better align the different organizations so that we can more tightly work together on going up-market, on app monetization and positioning ourselves well to be the ideal database for GenAI apps. Brad Sills -- Analyst Super exciting. Thanks, Dev. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Brad. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question, please. Our next question will be coming from the line of Mike Cikos of Needham and Company. Your line is open. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Hey guys, thanks for taking the question here. I just wanted to come back to the consumption growth being slightly better than expectations again for the second quarter in a row now. And apologies if I missed it, but this improvement that we're seeing, is this across all vintages and geographies or is it potentially more concentrated in scope? Just trying to get a better understanding of what's seeking place out there and what's embedded in the guide. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. No, I would describe it as broad-based, Mike. And obviously, we're pleased to see it and we're continuing monitoring and slicing and dicing it in different ways. And as we have information or insights to you, we'll share it. And without trying to throw a whole bunch of cold water on our mind, it was slightly better, or a step-function changed better, but good to see. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Terrific. And maybe for a quick follow-up for Dev. I think it builds off maybe Tyler's question at the top of the Q&A, but you had cited that some customers are thinking about their workloads more holistically and even looking to run AI workloads on-prem. How much of that do you think is just a function of customers are still trying to figure out how to optimize for latency and cost or is this more a demonstration of we really are in the early phases of the exploratory phase versus going into production? Is there any way to coarse that out or is the two not necessarily connected? Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer No, I think it's kind of a little bit of both. I think you have some customers who are very committed to running a big part of the estate on-prem. So by definition, then if they're going to build an AI workload, it has to be run on-prem, which means that they also need access to GPUs and they're doing that. And then other customers are leveraging basically renting GPUs from the cloud providers and building their own AI workloads. I do think we're in the very, very early days. They're still learning, experimenting. More-and-more apps are entering production. And as I said on the prepared remarks, we have thousands of workload -- AI workloads running on MongoDB, but a very small percentage of them have demonstrated meaningful product market fit. And so the initial traction is kind of still small. But I think as people get more sophisticated with AI, as the AI technology matures and becomes more and more useful, I think applications will -- you'll start seeing these applications take-off. I kind of chuckled that today I see more senior leaders bragging about the chips they're using versus the apps they're building. So it just tells you that we're still in the very, very early days of this big platform shift. Mike Cikos -- Analyst Great point. Thank you again, guys. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Mike. Operator Thank you. And one moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from the line of Eric Heath of KeyBanc. Your line is open. Eric Heath -- Analyst Hi, thanks for taking the question. Dev, Michael, it sounds like the takeaway from the call is a greater focus on EA and on enterprise. So should we structurally rethink the EA business differently and think of this more as a healthy double-digit growth business going forward for the foreseeable future? And then if I could just ask a follow-up question separate to that. But Michael, I understand that it's still early to identify the fiscal '25 cohort of workloads, but just curious at a high-level if they look and feel like of higher quality than the fiscal '24 cohort of workflow. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Do you want to take on the first one in terms of EA... Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, I mean, I would say, I mean, we are very committed to our run anywhere strategy. And as I said, we are first investing in community where for many customers is the first way they experience MongoDB. And we want them to have the full experience of integrating search and Vector search into our core product. And so they can out of the gate really start building applications. That will then transition to building those capabilities into EA. So, we are clearly investing in the EA product. But Atlas is still a big, big part of our business and a big, big part of our growth engine and we typically launch new features on Atlas and because of the capabilities we already have, the fact it's multi-cloud makes it a very, very compelling offering for many customers. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. And I think in terms of the workloads, I do think it's early. Just as a reminder for folks, they tend to start small, although grow quickly. I think the only other thing that I can add is, we've been pretty consistent and that we've been pleased with the new business that we've done. But we need some time to let the cohorts play out as we track them. But I think like I said, we've been happy with the new business that we were winning. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of William Power of Baird. Your line is open. Brian Raferty Denyeau -- Investor Relations You there, William? William Power -- Analyst Sorry, yeah. Thank you. Dev, you had some encouraging comments on relational migrator. I wonder if you could just touch on what you think is driving the higher interest here. I mean, it sounds like AI is contributing and helping, but it'd be great to get some more color there because that still feels like obviously a meaningful long-term opportunity. And then maybe the second part of the question for Dev or Michael, just be great to get any other framework around the professional services investments. Any way to kind of think about quantification and timing of that? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So the reason we're so excited about the opportunity to go after legacy applications is that, one, it seems like there's a confluence of events happening. One is that the increasing cost and tax of supporting and managing these legacy apps are just going up enough. Second, for many customers who are in regulated industries, the regulators are calling their -- the fact that they're running on these legacy apps with systemic risk, so they can no longer kick the can down the road. Third, also because they no longer can kick the can around, some vendors are going end-of-life, so they have to make a decision to migrate those applications to a more modern tech stack. Fourth, because GenAI is so predicated on data and to build a competitive advantage, you need to leverage your proprietary data, people want to access that data and be able to do so easily. And so that's another reason for them to want to modernize. And then you also have people who built those applications who are retiring or just no longer in the firm, so it just creates more and more risk for the companies. Given all that, customers are incredibly interested in figuring out a way to easily and safely and securely migrate those -- off those applications. And we always could help them very easily move the data and map the schema from a relational schema to a document schema. The hardest part was essentially rewriting the application. Now with the advent of GenAI, you can now significantly reduce the time. One, you can use GenAI to analyze existing code. Two, you can use GenAI to reverse engineer tests to test what the code does. And then three, you can use GenAI to build new code and then users test it to ensure that the new code produces the same results as the old code. And so all that time and effort is suddenly cut in a meaningful way and that's suddenly creating a lot of interest from customers saying, my goodness. And if you're already on a relational app, moving to another relational app doesn't feel like modernization. So, the other advantage is that moving to MongoDB gives them a much more modern platform, a much more agile, flexible, performant, and scalable platform for their future needs. And that's why we're so excited. Again, it's early days. We've run a number of pilots that have gone well. We're in the process of working with some customers now in the migration process. This will take time because these are very, very complex applications. And actually, one thing I also mentioned was that they're not just going after -- saying go after some tertiary Tier 2 or Tier 3 application, they're saying, hey, we want you to look at some of our crown jewels because these are the apps that are most painful for us. So that's also very exciting. But again, this will take time, but we're very committed to this, and we think this is going to drive -- help us drive long-term -- meaningful long-term growth. Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, Will. And to the last part of your question on the professional services investment, we're really building out that capacity in order to meet the demand that we're seeing relative to the opportunity. We're calling it in particular because it has a gross margin impact because that's where that will typically show up. And then maybe the last thing and it's probably obvious, but just to sort of underscore it is the reason we're doing this though is for the ARR, right, to drive the new workloads, the additional workloads over to MongoDB as part of that migration. And over time, as we've talked about before, we hope and expect to be able to leverage technology more and more, but at least initially and into the medium-term, there's going to be a healthy human/services component to that. Just wanted to sort of effectively telegraph that out to folks. William Power -- Analyst That's helpful. Thank you. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Will. Operator Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of Rudy Kessinger of DA Davidson. Please go ahead. Rudy Kessinger -- Analyst Hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in here. I believe last quarter you said consumption growth slightly ahead of expectations. And while down slower year-over-year growth versus Q2 last year, the year-over-year growth did improve from Q1. And so, I guess I'm curious for Q3, could you make a comment in that same regard? Obviously, slower on a year-over-year basis than Q3 last year, but was it stable with year-over-year consumption growth in Q2 or better or worse? Michael Gordon -- Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Rudy, thanks for the question. We haven't specifically called that out relative to Q2. We did see a lower year-over-year growth as we called out. We did see a seasonal rebound. Usually Q3 is stronger than Q2 and we talked about how that was smaller than in the prior year. So hopefully, that will help you all triangulate. Rudy Kessinger -- Analyst Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. I believe it was on your Q4 call back in March. At that point, Dev, you said it would be at least another year until AI applications are being deployed at scale. It sounds like the commentary that some early large workloads, but out of the thousands, just not many that are at large scale. I guess, is your expectation now that maybe it's still at least another year until we're seeing broad AI application rollouts at scale? Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I think a lot of it's a function of the what's happening in the R&D side of AI, right? So for example, today, we don't have a very compelling model designed for our phones, right, because today the phones don't have the computing horsepower to run complex models. So, you don't see a ton of very, very successful consumer apps besides, say, ChatGPT or Claude. So we don't -- we also don't see like hundreds of apps taking off like you saw kind of the first generation of like the Internet or the cloud era, right, or the mobile era. So like I think we're still in the early days of AI. And so while we see a lot of people building AI apps, a lot of them have kind of fairly rudimentary functionality. But I think that over time that's going to change. In fact, I know it will change. I just can't predict when that will happen. But where we do see apps having production, we are having traction, we're seeing them grow very, very quickly and we have a lot of them on our platform. It's just very few of them are really have meaningful. Operator Thank you. And that concludes today's Q&A session. I would like to go ahead and turn the call back over to Dev for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Dev C. Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, everyone. I just wanted to say we're really pleased with our Q3 results with strong new business performance and revenue exceeding expectations both -- across both Atlas and EA. We're making the necessary investments to expand our enterprise channel where we see the largest opportunity to establish MongoDB as a standard and the strongest returns on our go-to-market investments. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the progress we're making on both accelerating legacy app modernization with AI as well as establishing ourselves as a standard of the emerging AI tech stack for greenfield AI applications. And last but not least, I would like to thank Michael again for his contributions over the past 10 years and wish him well. Thank you, everyone, and we'll talk to you soon.

representing 68% total revenue. generated non-gaap operating income $101 million 19% non-gaap operating margin ended quarter 52,600 customers. overall, pleased performance third quarter. strong new business quarter happy new workload acquisition atlas. non-atlas business significantly exceeded expectation part benefited large multi-year deal customer continue value run anywhere strategy want build deeper longer-term relationship mongodb. atlas consumption slightly better expected macro-environment would characterize largely consistent saw first half year. michael cover consumption trend detail. retention rate remained strong q3, demonstrating mission criticality platform. q1 earnings call, shared three major strategic initiative believe enable u maximize long-term opportunity. want give update progress making initiatives. first, increasing investment enterprise channel since see strongest return part market. specifically, expanding strategic account program going next year, see account benefit incremental investment. addition, investing time resource educate developer large enterprise account uplevel mongodb skills. organization thousand developer penetrate deeply, encounter developer historically built sql application simply know use mongodb full potential. experience, educating developer benefit mongodb drive significant incremental adoption platform. fund up-market investments, reallocating portion mid-market investments. mid-market remains attractive opportunity us, believe prioritizing investment up-market deliver strong return current environment. also believe additional way serve mid-market efficiently self-serve channel scaled technology-enabled sale customer service motions. second, optimistic opportunity accelerate legacy app modernization using ai investing area. recall, ran successful pilot earlier year, demonstrating ai tooling combined professional service relational migrator product significantly reduce time, cost, risk migrating legacy application onto mongodb. early days, observed 50% reduction cost modernize. back strong early results, additional customer interest exceeding expectations. large enterprise every industry geography experiencing acute pain legacy infrastructure eager agile, performant, cost-effective solutions. customer excited engage us, also want focus important application enterprise, demonstrating level interest size long-term opportunity. relational application encompass wide variety database types, programming languages, versions, customer-specific variables, expect modernization project continue include meaningful service engagement short medium term. consequently, increasing professional service delivery capabilities, directly partners. long run, expect automate simplify large part modernization process. end, leveraging learning early service engagement develop new tool accelerate future modernization efforts. although early day scaling legacy app modernization capability take time, increased conviction motion significantly add growth long term. third, investing capitalize inherent technical advantage key component emerging ai tech stack. reminder, mongodb uniquely equipped query rich complex data structure typical ai applications. ability database query rich complex data structure crucial ai application often rely highly detailed, interrelated, nuanced data make accurate prediction decisions. example, recommendation system analyze single customer's purchase also considers browsing history, peer group behavior, product category requiring database query interlink complex data structures. addition, mongodb's architecture unifies source data, metadata, operational data, vector data all-in-one platform, updating need multiple database system complex back-end architectures. enables compelling developer experience alternative. see ai market today, customer still experimental stage work understand effectiveness underlying tech stack build early proof-of-concept applications. however, seeing increasing number ai apps production. today, thousand ai apps platform. yet see many apps actually achieving meaningful product market fit therefore significant traction. fact, take step back look entire universe ai apps, small percentage achieved type scale commonly see enterprise-specific applications. ai apps growing quickly, including one already seven-figure workload grown 10 time since beginning year. similar prior platform shift usefulness ai tech improves becomes cost-effective, see emergence many ai apps nail product market fit, difficult predict happen broadly. remain confident capture fair share successful ai application see platform popular developer building sophisticated ai use cases. continue investing product capabilities, including enterprise-grade atlas vector search functionality build momentum even better position mongodb capture ai opportunity. addition, previously announced, bringing search vector service community ea offerings, leveraging run anywhere competitive advantage world ai. finally, expanding mongodb ai application program maap, help enterprise customer build bring ai application production providing reference architectures, integration leading tech providers, coordinated service support. last week, announced new code partner including mckinsey, confluent, capgemini, unstructured, well collaboration meta enable developer build ai-enriched application mongodb using llama. next, like provide brief product update. dot local developer conference london october, announced general availability mongodb 8.0, fastest performant version mongodb ever. mongodb 8.0 performs 20% 60% better common industry benchmark compared prior version built exceed customers' stringent security, resiliency, availability, performance requirements. best serve customers, regularly review reprioritize investment product portfolio ensure allocating resource product highest demand customers. that, also deprecate product showing result desired. consequently, made decision consolidate atlas serverless offering smallest dedicated tier create atlas flex customers, new offering simpler architecture provides elasticity feature akin serverless. begin migrating effective customer single, simple, entry-level solution q4. also decided deprecate atlas devicesync capability widely adopted order focus engineering resource core platform. reprioritization decision made lightly, allow u deliver value largest number customers, reinforcing commitment best modern database helping u grow faster. now, like spend minute reviewing adoption trend mongodb across customer base. customer across industry around world running mission-critical project mongodb atlas,

promoting cedric pech, currently chief revenue officer newly created role president worldwide field operations. new position, cedric oversee field-based customer-facing go-to-market enablement teams, including professional services. believe org structure best enable u execute key strategic initiative discussed earlier, particular, increased focus up-market app monetization opportunity. would like congratulate cedric well-deserved promotion. that, let turn call michael. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer thanks, dev, thanks kind word incredible partnership past decade. past 10 year rewarding professional career extremely proud achieved together course, whole mongodb team. much success had, still believe mongodb early stage realizing full potential continues take share one largest market software. now, turning result quarter. begin detailed review third-quarter result finish outlook fourth quarter full fiscal year 2025. first, start third quarter results. total revenue quarter $529.4 million, 22% year-over-year high end guidance. shifting product mix, atlas grew 26% quarter compared previous year represents 68% total revenue compared 66% third quarter fiscal 2024 71% last quarter. recognized atlas revenue primarily based customer consumption platform consumption closely tied end user activity applications. let provide context atlas consumption quarter. q3, consumption slightly ahead expectations. year's q3 seasonal improvement muted year past expected. year-over-year basis, consumption growth remains prior year period. turning non-atlas revenue. non-atlas came significantly ahead expectations. dev mentioned, ea new business strong, continue success selling incremental workload existing customer base. addition, q3 non-atlas revenue benefited large multi-year deals. know, due asc 606, recognized entire term license component multi-year contract start contract. compared q3 last year, multi-year license component non-atlas revenue $15 million higher. turning customer growth. third quarter, grew customer base approximately 1,900 customer sequentially, bringing total customer count 52,600, 46,400 year-ago period. total customer count, 7,400 direct sale customers, compare 6,900 year-ago period. growth total customer count driven primarily atlas, 51,100 customer end quarter compared 44,900 year-ago period. important keep mind growth atlas customer count reflects new customer mongodb addition existing ea customer adding first atlas workload. continuing on, q3, net arr expansion rate approximately 120%. ended quarter 2,314 customer least $100,000 arr annualized mrr, $1,972 year-ago period. moving income statement, discussing result non-gaap basis unless otherwise noted. gross profit third quarter $405.7 million, representing gross margin 77%, flat versus year-ago period. income operation $101.5 million 19% operating margin third quarter compared 18% operating margin year-ago period. primary reason favorable operating income result versus guidance revenue outperformance, including high margin multi-year license revenue benefit. net income third quarter $98.1 million $1.16 per share, based 84.2 million diluted weighted average share outstanding. compare net income $79.1 million $0.96 per share 83.7 million diluted weighted-average share outstanding year-ago period. turning balance sheet cash flow, ended third quarter $2.3 billion cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash. operating cash flow third quarter $37.4 million. taking consideration approximately $2.9 million capital expenditure principal repayment finance lease liabilities, free cash flow $34.6 million quarter. compare free cash flow $35 million year-ago period. q3, incur capital expenditure purchase ipv4 address previously expected, start making purchase november still expect total outlay $20 million $25 million fiscal year previously communicated. like turn outlook fourth quarter full fiscal year 2025. fourth quarter, expect revenue range $515 million $519 million. expect non-gaap income operation range $55 million $58 million non-gaap net income per share range $0.62 $0.65 based 84.9 million estimated diluted weighted-average share outstanding. full-fiscal year 2025, expect revenue range $1.973 billion $1.977 billion, non-gaap income operation range $242 million $245 million, non-gaap net income per share range $3.01 $3.03 based 84 million estimated diluted weighted-average share outstanding. note non-gaap net income per share guidance fourth-quarter full-fiscal year 2025 includes non-gaap tax provision approximately 20%. provide context around updated guidance. first, term atlas consumption, expect see typical seasonal slowdown q4, driven underlying application usage moderating holiday season. second, since atlas consumption remained lower year-over-year basis q3, expect see continued deceleration atlas year-over-year growth q4. third, expect see sequential decline non-atlas revenue q4, contrary normal pattern. reason experienced significant additional benefit multi-year deal q3, expect recur q4. addition, want provide incremental color recent product -- recent product go-to-market change impact growth reported customer count going forward. first, dev explained, reallocating portion go-to-market resource mid-market enterprise channel. result, expect see significantly fewer mid-market direct sale customer net addition result, slower direct sale customer growth going forward. believe reallocation investment dollar drive higher revenue growth time. so, trade-off make sense. second, introduce atlas flex cluster q4 automatically migrate customer q1, expect see one-time negative impact customer count since approximately 4,000 serverless customer low spending expect transition flex. customer negligible impact revenue impact reported customer count. summarize, pleased third quarter result especially ability win new business. small share one largest fastest-growing market software number secular tailwinds, including ai back. continue investing judiciously focusing execution capture long-term opportunity. that, like open questions. operator? question & answers: operator [operator instructions] first question day coming sanjit singh morgan stanley. line open. sanjit singh -- analyst thank taking question congrats, michael, outstanding career. absolutely fantastic run mongodb. excited see next, excited take breather. congrats, michael. guess take question -- start questions, look atlas past two quarters, correct wrong, think consumption coming least modestly ahead expectations. relative seen beginning year, sort -- function sale execution? function end-user activity sort improving? what's driving least improvement atlas consumption past two quarters? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. different things. think look outlook beginning year, indicated thought would see stable atlas growth consumption standpoint. seen talked -- actually seen lower year-over-year growth based underlying consumption. -- that's incorporated q4 guide. seen q3 q4 -- sorry, q2 q3, excuse me, better expectations, still year-over-year basis. want make sure sort confusing comparative set year-over-year versus relative expectations. sanjit singh -- analyst understood. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer core it, sanjit, question really underlying usage applications. sanjit singh -- analyst yeah, make total sense. then, dev, ask ai agent question. term ai agent needing context, going set tool take actions. mean mongodb operational data store customer start roll agentic applications? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. so, talk agents, think think agents, there's jobs, there's -- sorry, there's job, there's project there's task. right now, agent rolled really focused task like say something sierra company rolling agents. right, deemed deal able create rich complex data structures. important ai ai model look isolated data points, need understand relationships, hierarchies, pattern within data. need able essentially get real-time insights. example, chatbot someone querying, customer kind trying get update order placed five minute ago may gotten confirmation, chatbot need able deal real-time information. need able deal basically handling advanced use cases, understanding like, thing like fraud detection understand behavior supply chains, need understand intricate data relationships. thing consistent mongodb offers. believe end day, well-positioned handle this. thing would say embedded natural way search vector search. oltp database, tech search vector search. that's one experience platform offer that, think real advantage. integrated leading ai framework platforms. enterprise-grade security compliance, customer run u anywhere, either 118 cloud region on-prem, huge differentiator us. sanjit singh -- analyst awesome. appreciate thoughts, dev. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thanks, sanjit. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line taylor -- tyler radke citi. line open. tyler radke -- analyst hi, thank much taking question. and, michael, best, congratulation 10 years. going back sale execution, mean, one thing talked earlier year challenge term recently acquired workload ramping. think lot past fiscal year. curious quality workload acquisition trended year. think ramp consumption potential next year, sort look versus time year ago? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. maybe talk change made michael talk little bit consumption trends. so, make change beginning year, really wanted focus volume quality workload slight adjustment made. think change reasonable positive impact. again, early declare victory workload usually start small grow time, really pleased result seeing far. -- again, early days. obviously, know fiscal '25 workload go fiscal '26. far, good. michael, consumption? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah, couple things, thanks, tyler. fiscal '24 cohort called earlier, slower growth continue. line revised expectations. made change talked -- earlier year affect fiscal '25 cohorts, early tell. those, need quarter data really see -- seeing behave differently. say talked new business environment success new business. pleased that, show kind initial piece, need see grow cohort evolve. tyler radke -- analyst great. thanks. follow-up ea side, talked outsized strength non-atlas business quarter. maybe could unpack like relative upside driven simply duration versus new business. know called duration impact year-over-year, -- feel like sort one-off feel like maybe bigger customer indexing toward ea impact way think product introducing thing like vector search stream processing onto on-prem product? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah, thank you. overall, continue find ea product resonate customers. important part run anywhere strategy continued see success people wanting increase investment mongodb. there's always multiyear component continue see that. talked beginning year fiscal '24 abnormally high amount multi-year benefit therefore, anticipating headwind quantified roughly $40 million range. talked call earlier saw large accounts, surprising amount multiyear positively benefited q3 little $15 million revenue compared saw q3 year ago. so, much headwind expecting. obviously, 606 dynamics, things, especially large deal kind meaty chunky lumpy, try call sort help people understand, there's pretty healthy kind baseline flow, ea, also multiyear. see spikes, try call you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. want add, tyler, investing call ea business. first, starting investing search vector search community product. couple thing us. one, whenever anyone start mongodb open-source product, immediately get benefit complete highly integrated platform. two, capability migrate ea. so, ea u investment strategy. definitely see lot large customer very, committed running workload on-prem. even see customer want run run ai workload on-prem. so, optionality get using mongodb on-prem cloud, also cross-cloud compelling one. tyler radke -- analyst thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line brad reback stifel. line open. brad reback -- analyst great. thanks much. and, michael, best luck. great run. dev, started call talking bunch investments, great given growth business. obviously, talked reallocating expenses. net-net, think incremental investment phase next year gating margin upside? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer think that's something obviously ready talk next year now, would say -- reason looking invest summarize again, going up-market legacy app modernization see large workload potentially play ideal database genai apps, future important investment drive long-term growth. quite energized investment that's something high conviction on. brad reback -- analyst that's great. maap program, workload going wind atlas healthy combination ea atlas? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer think early days. would say -- would probably say side atlas ea early days. think introduce search vector search ea product, see on-prem. obviously, people use mongodb ai workload using technology well conjunction mongodb on-prem ai use cases. would say probably going see happen first atlas. brad reback -- analyst great. thanks much. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line jason ader william blair. line open. jason ader -- analyst yeah, thank you. going belabor congratulating michael, fun working best luck. question strength ea. think, dev, represents comment enterprise might rethinking reassessing kind on-prem versus cloud workload placement decision? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer well, think large enterprises, think large enterprise meaningful workload still running on-prem. think belief everything would go cloud probably something really popular good old day zurp. think customer assess investment already place, much judicious run workload think leverage existing investment infrastructure, going so. also bunch reason like regulatory reasons, customer quite moving aggressively cloud. see particularly europe, see lot european bank still running majority workload on-prem. also varies region conversely asia, seeing people much move much aggressively cloud. think really depends industry, geography, personal dynamic what's happening particular account. mean, see large u bank also committed running thing on-prem. really varies. that's feel really good run anywhere strategy give customer optionality. build something run on-prem. choose move cloud, easy mongodb. jason ader -- analyst right. follow-up also investment making strategic sale enterprise. could get little specific investment might be? hiring lot new salespeople? working sis, investing sis? additional detail would helpful. thanks. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. everyone's benefit, identified number accounts, call strategic accounts, think high upside us. seen number account grow quickly deploy right mix resources. necessarily quota-carrying resources. could additional technical sale resources, additional p resources, additional customer service resource better service support accounts. even thing like run education session developer accounts, called either hackathons like call developer day even design review meet development team looking build application, help think would potentially use mongodb build particular app. find many developers, experience mongodb quite limited, engage them, educate show simple easy is. like example, customer today think like use oltp database, search database, maybe vector database, like caching database. integrated mongodb. sudden, customer say, wow, simplify life, simplify back-end infrastructure, build app far quickly much easier manage long-term everything mongodb. really function educating power mongodb really open lot opportunity us. that's doubling down, mix resource really predicated accounts, quota counting resources, whole suite resource bringing table. jason ader -- analyst thank you. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line andrew nowinski well fargo. line open. andrew nowinski -- analyst okay. good afternoon. thank much taking question congrats nice quarter. gave example customer migrated postgres think said issue pg vector function. wondering long customer using postgres decided make change mongo, meaning sort like rebound type customer chose pg -- excuse me, postgres work? frequently seeing type transition? dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. can't give specific long using postgres, -- trend seeing business. remember postgres 40-year-old technology. -- beneficiary people lifting shifting type relational databases, oracle, sql server, mysql, et cetera. open-source database. part -- open-source relational database, inherent challenge relational database do. quite inflexible. build schema, hard change schema. hard scale hard distribute data. large data volumes, weird thing like, example, resort off-road storage large data objects, creates performance bottlenecks. again, people default postgres know anything better know relational everyone kind moving relational platforms. that's whole point saying earlier. educate developer flexibility schema, easily horizontally scale rich query language aggregation sophisticated geospatial indexes, productivity gain using document model easy organize data, -- people like, wow, life much easier. want clear, zero-sum game. postgres fail u successful. big market quite excited opportunity, see customer moving postgres coming mongodb. andrew nowinski -- analyst thank you. helpful. maybe quick follow-up. normalize $15 million multiyear deal impact q3, would ea still sequentially q4? thank you. michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer given level guidance, trying help understand context full-year number headwind talked beginning year, given strength saw q3. andrew nowinski -- analyst got it. thanks. operator thank you. one moment next question. next question coming line raimo lenschow barclays. line open. raimo lenschow -- analyst hey, thank you. think ea strength quarter, michael, kind give u little bit there. like think renewal -- renewal situation renewal pool coming like q3, coming q4, et cetera, well like mean term upsell, cross-sell opportunity people think starting ai project self-serve, kind mentioned earlier call? michael gordon -- chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah. think -- think ea q4, tends large renewal quarter, talking term guide strength multiyear, that's would expect see ea sequentially, typically pattern, called out. term ai workload things, think early tell obviously, continue evolve assess view get full-year guide march. also updated view cohort behaving sort multiyear played out. think term q4, comment made earlier hopefully help. raimo lenschow -- analyst yeah. okay, perfect. -- talk little bit like obviously, there's debate like database persistent layer ai projects, et cetera. see big hyperscalers term working guy partnerships? obviously aws kind summit, et-cetera. speak little bit like relationship big guy evolving around this? michael, best case talk you. dev c. ittycheria -- president chief executive officer yeah. so, start partnership first, like -- aws, said, re:invent show last week. -- remains very, strong. closed ton deal past quarter. very, large deals. integration new product like q bedrock engagement field really strong. azure, think -- shared past, start-off little bit slow start, word person run partner leadership, azure mongodb relationship never stronger. closed large number deals. part what's called azure native ic service program bunch deep integration azure, including fabric, power bi, visual studio, semantic kernel, azure openai studio. also one azure's largest marketplace partners. gcp -- actually seen uptick term co-sales done past quarter gcp made comp change -- favorable working mongodb saw result field, focused closing -- closing handful large deal gcp q4. general, would say, thing going quite well. term of, guess, implying question like hyperscalers potentially bundling thing along ai offerings? mean, candidly, since day one,

         "Autodesk ( ADSK -0.45% ) Q3 2025 Earnings Call Nov 26, 2024 , 5:00 p.m. ET Contents: Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants Prepared Remarks: Operator Thank you for standing by, and welcome to Autodesk third quarter and fiscal year 2025 financial results conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Simon Mays-Smith, VP, investor relations. Please go ahead. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Thanks, operator, and good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the third quarter results of Autodesk's fiscal '25. On the line with me is Andrew Anagnost, our CEO; and Betsy Rafael, our interim CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including outlook and related assumptions and on product and strategies. Actual events or results could differ materially. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-Q and the Form 8-K filed with today's press release for important risks and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today. If this call is replayed or reviewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Autodesk disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will quote several numeric or growth changes during this call as we discuss our financial performance. Unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison. All non-GAAP numbers referenced in today's call are reconciled in our press release or Excel financials and other supplemental materials available on our Investor Relations website. And now, I will turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Simon, and welcome, everyone, to the call. We finished the third quarter of the year strongly, delivering 12% revenue growth in constant currency and have again raised full year guidance. This reflects the sustained momentum of the business and successful execution of our strategy, including a smooth implementation of the new transaction model in Western Europe. Once again, opportunity, resilience and discipline underpinned our performance. Last month at Autodesk University in San Diego, we hosted 12,000 registered attendees and another 30,000 online. We showed how granular data in the cloud, organized the data models and connected to everything through APIs to deliver even more valuable and connected solutions for customers and partners and support a much broader ecosystem and marketplace. Customers and channel partners that I spoke with at AU remain cautiously optimistic, a sentiment consistent with the underlying momentum of our business, our growing product usage and BuildingConnected bid activity trends over recent quarters. I left AU with a tremendous sense of purpose and optimism in the ingenuity and persistence of our customers and for the future. On our earnings call last quarter, I set out our secular growth opportunities and our strategy to capitalize on them. I concluded that Autodesk's investment in cloud, platform and AI in pursuit of those opportunities were ahead of its peers. AU was a good demonstration of that. But we're also leading the industry in modernizing our go-to-market motion starting a few years ago with the subscription transition through consumption and self-service enablement and more recently to direct billing. These initiatives enable Autodesk to build larger and more durable direct relationships with its customers and to serve them more efficiently. We have already seen significant benefits from initiatives like these, and there's more to come in the next optimization phase. Taking out the effects on margins from FX and the new transaction model, we still expect to be toward the midpoint of our fiscal '26 non-GAAP operating margin target of 38% to 40% in fiscal '25, a year ahead of schedule. We're confident we will make further improvement in fiscal '26 on the same basis. The new transaction model will enable tighter channel partnerships with less duplication of effort and more digital self-service and automation, which increases customer satisfaction and workforce productivity. It will also create new opportunities for partners Autodesk to earn more with less emphasis on transaction revenue sharing and a greater emphasis on value creation for customers. Once complete, we expect the new transaction model and subsequent go-to-market optimization to increase sales and marketing efficiency and deliver GAAP margins among the best in the industry. Attractive, long-term, secular growth markets, a focused strategy delivering ever more valuable and connected solutions to our customers, and a resilient business are generating strong and sustained momentum, both in absolute terms and relative to peers. Disciplined execution and capital deployment has driven even greater operational velocity and efficiency within Autodesk and will underpin the mechanical build of revenue and free cash flow over the next few years and GAAP margins among the best in the industry. We will continue to deploy capital to offset and buy forward dilution as our free cash flow grows from the fiscal '24 trough. This practice has reduced our share count over the last three years. We have significantly increased our share repurchase authorization to extend this momentum flexibility over the medium term, with the precise trajectory remaining dependent on our debt repayment schedule and the ebb and flow of M&A. In combination, we believe these factors will deliver sustainable shareholder value over many years. Before I conclude, I'd like to formally welcome Janesh to Autodesk. We're excited to welcome Janesh, who brings a wealth of experience and will be instrumental in sustaining Autodesk's growth and enhanced profitability momentum. Of equal importance, I'd like to thank Betsy for stepping in as interim CFO at an important time in the company's journey, and I'm looking forward to continuing to work closely with her as an Autodesk Board member. I will now turn the call over to Betsy to discuss our quarterly financial performance and guidance for the year. I'll then return to provide an update on our strategic growth initiatives. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Andrew. Q3 was another strong quarter. We generated broad-based underlying growth across products and regions. In addition, we saw revenue increases from the new transaction model and M&A which were offset by the absence of enterprise business agreement true-ups from Q3 last year and FX. Our Make products continued to enhance growth, driven by our ongoing strength in construction and Fusion. Overall, macroeconomic policy and geopolitical challenges and the underlying momentum of the business were consistent with the last few quarters, with continued strong renewal rates and headwinds to our new business growth. Total revenue grew 11% and 12% in constant currency. By product, in constant currency, AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT revenue grew 8%. AEC revenue, which was most impacted by the absence of true-up revenues, grew 12%, Manufacturing revenue grew 16% and still comfortably in double digits, excluding upfront revenue. And M&E revenue grew 15% boosted by the PIX acquisition and associated integration adjustments. By region, in constant currency, revenue grew 11% in the Americas which was most impacted by the absence of true-up revenues, 13% in EMEA and 14% in APAC. The mechanical contribution from the new transaction model to revenue was $17 million in the third quarter and $25 million on a year-to-date basis. Direct revenue increased 23% and represented 42% of total revenue, up 4 percentage points from last year, benefiting from strong growth in both EBAs and the Autodesk store and also the natural tailwind to revenue from the new transaction model. Net revenue retention rate remained within the 100% to 110% range at constant exchange rates. Billings increased 28% in the quarter, reflecting a tailwind from the prior-year shift to annual billings for most multiyear contracts, early renewals and the natural tailwind from the transition to the new transaction model. Similar to last quarter, and as expected, co-terming negatively impacted billing ahead of the launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe. The natural contribution from the new transaction model to billing was $72 million in the third quarter and $108 million on a year-to-date basis. Total deferred revenue decreased 9% to $3.7 billion and was again impacted by the transition from upfront to annual billings for multiyear contracts. Total RPO of $6.1 billion and current RPO of $4.0 billion grew 17% and 14%, respectively, which reflects a tailwind from early renewals and the new transaction model and a headwind from the declining contribution of billed and unbilled deferred revenue from large, multiyear and EBA cohorts ahead of renewal in fiscal '26. Excluding these, current RPO growth was broadly consistent with Q2. We do expect the new transaction model and the larger FY '26 renewal cohorts to have a greater impact on both RPO and current RPO growth in Q4 of fiscal '25. Turning to margins. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were broadly low. With Autodesk University shifting back to Q3 this year from Q4 last year, GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins decreased by 2 and 3 percentage points, respectively. The timing effect from AU obviously washes out over the full year. At current course and speed, the ratio of stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue peaked in fiscal '24, will follow by more than a percentage point in fiscal '25 and will be below 10% over time. Free cash flow for the quarter was $199 million. This benefited from some channel partners in Western Europe booking business earlier in the quarter ahead of the transition to the new transaction model really to derisk month one after the transition. This accelerated free cash flow to the third quarter, which was partially offset by the expected negative impact of co-terming in Western Europe. Turning now to capital allocation. We continue to actively manage capital within our framework and deploy it with discipline and focus through the economic cycle to drive long-term shareholder value. As expected, the pace of buybacks picked up in the third quarter. We purchased approximately 1.2 million shares for $319 million at an average price of approximately $269 per share. We will continue to deploy capital to offset and buy forward dilution as our free cash flow grows from the fiscal '24 trough. This practice has reduced our share count by about 5 million shares over the last three years with an average percentage reduction of about 70 basis points per year. We increased the amount authorized under our share repurchase program by $5 billion for a total of approximately $9 billion. This expands our flexibility over the medium term with the precise trajectory remaining dependent on our debt repayment schedule as well as, the ebbs and flow of M&A. Now let me finish with guidance. As we said in the February, the pace of the rollout of the new transaction model will create noise in billings and the P&L. So, we think free cash flow is the best measure of our performance. Taking out that noise, the underlying momentum in the business remains consistent with the expectations embedded in our guidance range for the full year with continued strong renewal rates and headwinds to new business growth. Our sustained momentum in the third quarter and smooth launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe, reduced the likelihood of our more cautious forecast scenario. Given that, we're raising the midpoint of our billing, revenue, margin, earnings per share and free cash flow guidance ranges. So, let me give you a little bit more detail. The underlying momentum of billing is in line with our expectations. Compared to our modeling at the start of the year, the launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe in Q3 and early renewals have been a tailwind for billings, whereas more co-terming, more business done under the old buy-sell model before the launch of the new transaction model and in recent weeks, FX movement have been headwinds for billing. We now estimate that the new transaction model will provide between a 5 and 5.5 percentage point tailwind to billings growth in fiscal '25. We've raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 billings guidance by $10 million to a range of $5.90 billion to $5.98 billion. The underlying momentum of revenue is also in line with our expectations. We estimate the new transaction model will provide around 1 to 1.5 percentage point tailwind to revenue growth in fiscal '25. Upfront revenue contributed 2 percentage points to revenue growth in Q4 of fiscal '24, and therefore, this is a headwind in Q4 of fiscal '25. While not large enough to call out at the start of the year, it was already factored into our Q4 and our full year model. We've raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 revenue guidance range by $18 million to a range of $6.12 billion to $6.13 billion. We're increasing our GAAP and non-GAAP margin guidance midpoint by 25 basis points by raising the bottom end of the ranges by 50 basis points. The GAAP margin guidance range is now 21.5% to 22%. The non-GAAP margin guidance range is now 35.5% to 36%, which includes a 1 to 1.5 percentage point underlying margin improvement, broadly offset by the margin headwinds from the new transaction model and the related incremental investments in people, processes and automation. The underlying momentum of free cash flow is also in line with our expectations. The headwind to billings from co-terming and FX rates that I mentioned earlier, is being offset by early renewals, faster collections and improved underlying margins. We raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 free cash flow guidance by $10 million and tightened the range to $1.47 billion to $1.5 billion. We expect strong free cash flow growth in fiscal '26 because of the return of our largest multiyear renewal cohort the natural mechanical stacking of multiyear contracts billed annually and a larger EBA cohort. With our current trajectory, we still estimate free cash flow in fiscal '26 to be around $2.05 billion at the midpoint. The slide deck on our website has more details on modeling assumptions for Q3 and for the full fiscal year '25. And while this may be my last earnings call for Autodesk, I will stick around for a bit to ensure a smooth transition to Janesh. Thank you, Andrew, and everyone at Autodesk for your support while I was here and to the many investors and the analysts with whom I've had lively discussions over the last few quarters. While the transition to annual billings for multiyear contracts and the deployment of the new transaction model has created noise and billings in the P&L, they do provide a natural near-term tailwind to revenue and free cash flow growth. Combined with a resilient business model, sustained competitive momentum, Autodesk has enviable sources of visibility and certainty to very uncertain world. For all these reasons, I stepped down from my role as interim CFO with tremendous optimism for the future. Andrew, back to you. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Betsy. Let me finish by updating you on our strong progress in the third quarter. We continue to see good momentum in AEC, particularly in infrastructure and construction, fueled by customers consolidating onto our solutions to connect and optimize previously siloed workflows through the cloud. The cornerstone of that growing interest is our comprehensive end-to-end solutions in completing designs, preconstruction, field execution through handover and into operations. This breadth of connected capability enables us to extend our footprint further into infrastructure and construction and also expand our reach into the mid-market. As a sign of our growing momentum as the benefits of our end-to-end solution become more apparent, our construction business continue to perform robustly with net new customers doubling year over year and existing customers' renewal and expansion rates remaining strong. Let me give you a few examples. Power Construction is No. 79 on the Engineering News Record, ENR Top 400 U.S. contractor list. It is a Chicago-based general contractor serving residential and nonresidential end markets. After completing a competitive RFP to replace its legacy project management tool, Power selected Autodesk for its unified construction platform across preconstruction, construction, and DDC. By standardizing on Autodesk Construction Cloud, Power will have a single source of truth for project data, enhanced collaboration capabilities, and streamlined workflows on a single platform. Power Construction was one of two ENR 400 top 100 U.S. contractors that standardized enterprisewide on Autodesk build during the quarter. In Europe, Bouygues, a top 10 ENR 250 international contractor based in France and a leader in sustainable building and infrastructure projects renewed and expanded its EBA in the quarter. Bouygues is continuing to consolidate on Autodesk solutions across the enterprise, including broader adoption of Autodesk Forma, Carbon Insight, and Informed Design to digitize, decarbonize, and industrialize projects. It also significantly increased its commitment to Autodesk Construction Cloud to drive efficiency gains and faster bid response times through better collaboration between design and project teams. Surbana Jurong is No. 23 on ENR's top 225 international design firms. Based in Singapore, it is an urban infrastructure and integrated solutions consulting firm. In Q3, it renewed its third EBA, which included increased investment in Autodesk Construction Cloud and Autodesk Water infrastructure solutions. ACC is helping to scale its operations through increased automation, integrated design workflows and enhanced collaboration across time zones. Our water infrastructure solutions will be a core technology supporting its growth ambitions in planning, designing, engineering and managing water projects for customers worldwide. Again, these stories have a common theme. Managing people, processes and data across the project life cycle to increase efficiency and sustainability while decreasing risk. Over time, we expect the majority of all projects to be managed this way, and we remain focused on enabling that transition through our industry cloud. Moving on to manufacturing. We made excellent progress on our strategic initiatives. Customers continue to invest in their digital transformation and consolidate our Design and Make platform. Fusion remains one of the fastest-growing products in the manufacturing industry. As customers seek to drive innovation and growth at lower cost, Fusion extension attach rates are increasing, which is helping to drive the average sales price higher. For example, in the quarter, a global manufacturer supplying the semiconductor industry selected Fusion Manage and Vault PLM over competitive solutions to foster greater collaboration across manufacturing sites and improve operating efficiency. Once fully scaled and operational, this customer expects to save 105,000 hours per year by connecting people and data, resulting in reduced product development costs and faster time to market. In the U.K., Playdale Playground has been designing, manufacturing, and installing outdoor playground equipment for over 40 years. This quarter, Playdale added Fusion to its existing portfolio of Autodesk solutions, including Inventor, AutoCAD, and Vault to streamline and digitize workflows, optimize production to reduce lead times, reduce nonconformities, and replace inefficient Excel-driven operations on the shop floor. A long time Autodesk customer and global leader in precision engineering solutions renewed and expanded its EBA in the quarter. In addition to Inventor, vault and AutoCAD, it is adopting Fusion's generative design capabilities for material waste reduction and fluid flow optimization and Moldflow to reduce manufacturing costs and defects while increasing mold yields. In education, universities continue to modernize their courses and curriculum to attract and prepare future engineers. For example, from this winter, students at the University of Stuttgart, Institute for Medical Device Technology will use Fusion across six courses. Fusion was selected to replace a competitive solution for its modern platform, ease of use, cloud collaboration capabilities and unique combination of PCB and additive manufacturing workflows in a single team environment. And lastly, we continue to work with our customers to ensure they are using the latest and most secure versions of our software. For example, after a period of rapid scaling and diversification, a large multinational manufacturing company in APAC was looking to align compliance rates across its global employee base. Working collaboratively we address compliance issues while cementing a long-term partnership and completing one of our largest ever license compliance agreements, which included expanded adoption of Alias and VRED for the Design Studio and PDMC for mechanical engineering and rail design. Attractive long-term secular growth markets, a focused strategy delivering ever more valuable and connected solutions to our customers and a resilient business are generating strong and sustained momentum both in absolute terms and relative to peers. Disciplined execution and capital deployment is driving an even greater operational velocity and efficiency within Autodesk, and we continue to deploy capital to deliver sustainable shareholder value over many years. I retain a tremendous sense of purpose and optimism in the ingenuity and persistence of our customers and for the future. Operator, we would now like to open the call up for questions. Questions & Answers: Operator Thank you. [Operator instructions] Again, please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Jason Celino of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your question, please. Jason Celino -- Analyst Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Just two for me. The first one, Andrew. Some of us are unfamiliar with Janesh. Can you just tell us a little bit more about him and what he brings to Autodesk? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director I certainly can. Before I do that, let me make sure that I thank Betsy for everything she brought to Autodesk during this interim period. I really appreciate it. The company appreciates it. Thank you, Betsy. Now we're really excited about Janesh. Let me tell you why we're excited about Janesh. As you remember, one of the things I was telling you that I was looking for was someone that was going to be able to dispassionately drive optimization at scale inside of Autodesk. And what that really means is someone that's going to be really inwardly focused, looking at every dollar that we invest and making sure that we're getting the most return for the business that investors are getting the best return from their business. The next kind of criteria we were looking for, which was nice to have was, time in the seat as a sitting CFO, which was important for us as well. But it was kind of the next nice to have after the optimization at scale. Janesh brings a great balance of both of those things, right? He's been in the seat seven years at Elastic, both CFO and COO, driving some fairly turbulent changes inside of Elastic. So, he's got battle stars from pushing inside the company to get changes done inside, and we like that. We like that a lot. He's also got very good early experience at companies that we feel have always added value to Autodesk. So, he was it VMware in a senior position. He was at Cisco in a senior position. We've had good success bringing people from those kind of companies. He worked at those companies driving optimization at scale, which is the No. 1 criteria I was looking for when we we're driving this work. He also has another nice to have. He's got knowledge of our industry. He spent two years at PTC in his career. He was actually recently on the PTC board. So, he understands our industry, and he'll be able to get up to speed pretty quickly. The No. 1 goal here drive optimization and scale over the next few years, make sure that we're getting everything we need from every dollar we invest, which is a very important theme for Autodesk. And with that, I'm really excited, and I'm looking forward to him joining in December. Jason Celino -- Analyst OK. Great. Interesting. And then for my second question, now that you do have a CFO, do you have any thoughts on when you might hold the next Investor Day? I think in the past, you usually did it in March. Is that a good time frame? Or is that too soon? Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. Well, Janesh is joining in December. I think we need to give him time to get his sea legs on giving time to kind of drive the end of the year and actually get us set up for next fiscal year in good stead. So, I would say it's unlikely we'll be doing anything in the spring, but we'll get back to you on that as soon as Janesh is ready to talk about those things. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Your question, please. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst Thank you. Andrew, as of the third quarter, your three-year CAGR for current RPO is about 12%. How are you thinking about the sustainability or perhaps improvement upon that CAGR or CRPO over the next number of years? When we think about the ingredients of that, it looks like over the last several years, the CAGR for your unit volume for all brands is roughly 6% to 7% in the aggregate. So, on top of that, you've had price and other ingredients, but perhaps talk about how you think you might be able to improve upon the most recent trajectory for current RPO. Then my follow-up. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Hi, Jay, this is Betsy. Let me just give you a couple of things. There's a number of things that are going on, on the headline of the CRPO number. If you first take away the headwinds and the tailwinds was broadly consistent with the second quarter. And as I mentioned in my opening commentary, early renewals and growth with -- and the new transaction model are providing a tailwind. And then there's also a headwind to CRPO growth from the declining contribution of billed and unbilled deferred revenue risk from the large multiyear EBA cohorts coming up for renewal in fiscal '26. And just as a reminder, these are the same larger cohorts we are calling out as the tailwinds to free cash flow for next year. And if you look back to fiscal '22, we saw the same dynamic ahead of the fiscal '23 renewals as well. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst OK. Since new management is part of the news this evening, could you talk about how you're thinking about the chief revenue officer position. Would it make sense perhaps to continue to have a separate CRO? Or do you think it might make more sense perhaps to combine CRO and COO? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, we're going to continue to have a separate CRO because we have various functions that work together there under the COO organization, including our IT organization, our infrastructure and all things associated. What we're looking for in our CRO is someone that understands how to continue to drive a business when you have direct engagement with the customer. So, that means someone that really understands what it takes to analyze self-service patterns, actually understand the data that comes in from the customers to help drive cross-sell and upsell while also transforming a channel from a transactionally focused extension of Autodesk to kind of a solution partner that's driving life cycle solutions for our customers. So, that's the kind of role we're looking for here. And yes, it's going to continue to be a stand-alone CRO role within the COO organization. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Borg of Stifel. Your line is open. Adam Borg -- Analyst Awesome. Thanks so much for taking the questions, and congrats to Betsy and Janesh. Maybe on the new transaction model. I know it's still early. But I was just curious, are there any learnings from those customers that are on the new model that you're seeing in terms of the adoption of Autodesk technology and the ability to find white space to better upsell and cross-sell different solutions now that you have a more direct relationship. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah, Adam, it's really early on to be able to make any kind of conclusions about that. What I can tell you is that we definitely see some shifts to some of the direct channels at Autodesk for customers that were probably just served on a very kind of arm's length kind of transactional level. But in terms of driving cross-sell and upsell, early days, early days. But if you want to get a sense for how that might evolve, we've got experience with our EBAs and our enterprise business agreements. And we've learned over the years that having that kind of relationship with the customer where we really understand their usage patterns, who they are and what they're doing, we are much more effective at driving cross-sell and upsell even when partnering with our channel partners. So, I think those kind of stand as a testament of what's possible as we move forward with completion of the new transaction model. Adam Borg -- Analyst Great. And maybe just as a quick follow-up. Just as we think about the new administration coming in, you talked about the macro being broadly consistent. Any change in tone in your conversations with the end markets in terms of optimism or their ability or willingness to expand new projects ahead of the administration? Any pause or just full steam ahead? I'm just curious, any commentary you have there from a macro perspective would be really, really helpful. Thanks so much. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director What I'll say is the things that matter to our customers are bipartisan things, all right? Our customers care about infrastructure builds out. Both parties care about infrastructure build-outs. Our customers care about domestic manufacturing in Europe, be it in the United States, both parties agree that the domestic manufacturing build-outs are important. Supply chain, independent, supply chain stability. All of these things are bipartisan issues that really affect our customers. So, regardless of the administration, I suspect the things that are important to our customers are continuing to be a focus. Adam Borg -- Analyst Thanks, again. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink of Baird. Please go ahead, Joe. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst Thank you. On the outlook for next year, $2.050 billion in free cash has, I think, been the expectation for the past year now. Within the last year, you've also seen more co-term of contracts. And I think that leads to better billings in FY '26. So, my question is, does that actually create the potential that things are better, and that's why you're qualifying now the $2.050 billion as the midpoint of possibilities. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer There's no change to how we've talked about the free cash flow guide for fiscal '26, it continues to be $2.05 billion at the mid-point. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst OK. Fair enough. And then just on the M&A environment, over recent history, Autodesk has been more in a mode of, I would say, strategic tuck-ins. I think there is actually an asset in the CFD simulation space that was announced during AU in the quarter. Is that the right approach for Autodesk, just given this point in time, all the work you've done to build out the cloud platform, the data models, and so these tuck-ins make the most sense? And if that's true, how would you maybe compare and contrast some of the larger-scale M&A that's happening with your peers in the space? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, look, consolidation in our space is inevitable. I'm not going to comment on any specific deals, but here's what I'll say. Autodesk has always been an acquisitive company, and we will be an inquisitive company when that makes both strategic and financial sense for the company. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst OK. Thank you. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Joe. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Porter of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Elizabeth. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great, thanks so much for the question. As partners are getting customers just up and running on the new transaction model, we picked up that they're spending a little bit more time than usual of time and resources with those existing customers. So, I was curious if that had any impact on new business demand kind of more recently -- and then just more broadly, any change in new business trends that you think you should call out from versus last quarter? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Elizabeth, it's Betsy. And so, just broadly speaking, we continue to see growth, but at a slower pace due to a number of factors really over the last several years, macro, COVID, exiting Russia, elections, and while a drag on the forward momentum of the business, all of that really factored into our guidance. So, I kind of just will leave it at that. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great. And then a follow-up just on billings. I understand there's a lot of volatility around the change from multiyear in the transaction model. But it looks like guidance implies a bigger step down in growth in Q4, just despite easier year-ago compare. So, hoping that you could help us unpack the balance of those headwinds and tailwinds that would drive kind of a greater downtick in growth in Q4. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, again, let me start out with just from a fiscal '25 perspective. Your billing tailwinds are going to be from the final shift to annual billings, new transaction model and early renewals. And you're going to get headwinds from co-terming and business booked ahead of the new transaction model launch and in recent weeks, some FX. So, again, I think that we've continued to perform well as we've executed through through Q3. And so, I think we feel very, very strongly about our expectations for Q4. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bhavin Shah of Deutsche Bank. Your question please, Bhavin. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Great, thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the quarter. Andrew, at university, there appeared to be a noticeable uptick in attendance and sessions geared toward owners and operators. What been driving the recent interest from the segment? How much of it is product enhancements you guys have made versus really more focusing and emphasizing from a go-to-market perspective? And how long before this segment of buyers kind of becomes more meaningful to the financials? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah, Bhavin, that's an excellent question, right. We're very interested in tackling the whole entire life cycle from design, through make, construction, manufacturing, all the way into operations. You're probably aware we have a product called Tandem. And a lot of those sessions were driven by increasing interest and increasing adoption of Tandem, which is a digital twin solution, tightly coupled to our solutions that also has a toolkit that allows people to easily connect sensor data through the digital twin solution. So, you're seeing that uptick because we're directly releasing products and capabilities that are of interest to the owner space. You can expect to see that trend continue over time, and you can expect to see us continue to talk about the owner space, continue to deliver solutions for the owner space and even APIs for the owner space. It's an area of great interest, especially when it comes not only to vertical buildings, but factories and other things that are related to that as well as, infrastructure like what we were doing with some of our water owner solutions. So, yes, owners matter. We're building software for them, and you're going to see more of that. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Super helpful there. And then, Betsy, one for you. Just in terms of the underlying improvement that we've been seeing in the margins, and I know you've called out FX and the transaction model. I know it's very early, but as you think about next year, how do we think about like the impact of FX and the transaction model to kind of the headline operating margins? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, I wish I could give you that answer, but I think that the new CFO would probably have a little bit of a problem with that. So, we'll wait till the end of February to give you more specifics on that. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Fair enough. Thanks for taking may questions. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Good try. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke of Citi. Please go ahead, Tyler. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Yeah, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I was going to ask you about a placeholder for next year's guidance, Betsy. don't want to waste a question on that, but feel free to answer. But Andrew, I wanted to kind of ask you about some of your comments you made around efficiency, especially as it relates to hiring Janesh, who you pointed out has a lot of experience at larger companies, VMware, Cisco, et cetera. Now that you're a few quarters into this transaction model rollout, you have kind of visibility better on some of the channel prior channel relationships, having that direct billing with the customer. What are some of the areas that you've identified as having that efficiency potential? And then as we think about that efficiency unlock, should we think about that as incremental to the free cash flow number you have out for next year? Or is that embedded in that already. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director So, many layers to that question. All right. First, let me kind of answer the question in a series of stages then dodge other ones, OK? So, first off, optimization is kind of a mindset at Autodesk. It's not something that that suddenly happens. I want to reemphasize that because if you look right now, this year, for example, when you look at the apples-to-apples comparison, which will be in the slide decks, are in our disclosed materials you can see that our non-GAAP margins are already hitting the targets we set for next year this year, OK? So, optimization is a mentality. You've also heard me say over and over again as the new transaction model starts to roll out, optimization of our go-to-market efforts is going to be a critical step for us and part of the optimization journey that we're on, that's going to deliver margin growth for the company for couple of years to come, OK? And I think that's important. It's a long-term driver. Now with getting into the specifics, OK? I think the specifics are probably for another time, but let me just kind of give you a sense for some of the things that are important, right? One is the drive to self-service, right? Self-service is a huge impact on how our customers will engage with us and where those customers come from, and that is value accretive to Autodesk, both on an efficiency side, from renewals and other things, but also on the revenue growth side through capturing the customers directly. The other thing I talked about is understanding the customer better, so the upsell and cross-sell. So, we're going to be able to do a lot more automation and understanding about where the opportunities are, and that's going to drive some efficiencies. And we're moving the channel partners away from this model of being the transactional players to being the solution providers and the IP providers to our customers. That's going to have all sorts of opportunities to eliminate duplication of effort and drive real cost efficiencies for the company moving forward. There's both top-line efficiencies here in revenue growth, but there's bottom line efficiencies as well through removing the redundancies and steps that just aren't necessary for the customer. You'll get a lot more clarity on that as you see us continue to move forward with this go-to-market optimization in the next year and beyond that. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Great. And then my follow-up question, Andrew, you talked about some really strong net new customer additions within the Construction Cloud, I think, doubling year over year. we also saw the Make revenue accelerate to 28% constant currency. Can you just help us understand, do you think that reacceleration is durable? And how are you sort of thinking about just your position there? What's been driving that strength in the new customer additions? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director First, let me comment on the make revenues, then I'm going to go into construction. So, the make revenue also includes some revenue from PIX and things associated with that. However, let's talk about the facts around our construction business because I think this is important, right? No. 1 factor is that we continue to drive consistent, high growth in our construction solutions. You're seeing it. It's built into the Make numbers, and it's the lion's share of those Make numbers. You're really seeing some consistent growth there. That's organically. Inorganically, we're actually executing incredibly well on things like Payapps, and that's driving acceleration of our growth. So, we are not decelerating as a business, OK? We are actually performing solidly inorganically, we're accelerating, all right? And I just want to be really clear about that. And yes, we said year over year, we drove a 2x increase in our new customers. And I'll talk about where some of that's coming from in just a minute. But I also want to highlight the other thing that's going on we are strengthening an already strong position in the ENR 400. So, you heard about the story about power construction, which was a great example of someone taking out a competitive RFP and say, look, I need a forward-looking cloud-based solution on new technology that goes end to end from design to construction all the way to operations. And they chose us. And that was just one example that we gave in the opening commentary. So, already a strengthening position in the ENR 400. Now the other qualitative things that are driving some of that new customer growth is we already have our distribution channel operating at scale. In the U.S., this is helping us go down market more effectively, which is allowing us to capture more customers more effectively be places where we weren't before and where others aren't, which is part of driving that. But also, we're already at scale operating internationally with our distribution channel. So, that's driving international growth for us. And that's a really important driver as well as, some of those net new accounts that you're seeing there. And the last thing I'll add that I'm done with construction is that, look, I heard this over and over again at AU, I'm hearing it over and over again from customers in lots of different places. They want the end-to-end solution. They want the licensed version in the cloud, they're placing bets for the next 10 years. They want to go from design to construction to operations, and that's just making our solution more attractive to the market. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo. Your question, please. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Hey, thanks very much. I appreciate you taking the questions. A commentary on the call sounded consistent, but wondering if there are any added details you can provide for us on just the overall macro spend environment and how that's maybe progressing across either key product segments or geos, whatever split you think is more useful. I think what we're trying to get a sense for is if there are any shades of improvement anywhere or if you'd characterize as mainly just consistent over the past couple of quarters. Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Michael, I think the core answer here is consistency, OK? We're seeing consistent trends that we've seen with -- in all the other quarters. There's always puts and takes in a large business like ours, especially ones as divers as ours. But the general tone is consistent with prior quarters. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer And I would just add that there's also been a lot of noise this year from the new transaction model and then obviously, the elections and leading up to that. And so, it's hard to sparse out kind of that particular behavior. So, I think as Andrew said, we call it consistent. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Yeah, tough for us, too. That's why we keep asking. Betsy, congrats on the transition back given you're also on the board. I think it'd be useful to hear you chime in on the hiring of Janesh and maybe just also comment on how you ensure you're able to hand over the reins and keep progress going on the key transitions the company is working through. Thanks. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Per se, I was involved in the process, which was quite extensive in the company and the recruiting of Janesh. And so, we're certainly very excited to have him on board. What I would also say is, obviously, with my experience of being on the board for 11 years as well as, my deep dive into the business over the last six months. One of the reasons I'm staying around until the end of the fiscal year, is I think I could be really helpful in that transition for Janesh. And so, I'm very much looking forward to it. And I think that we have a great finance team, and I think that he's going to fit very well, and I'm looking forward to making that happen as fast as we can. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. Your question, please, Matthew. Mike Richards -- Analyst Hey, guys. This is Mike Richards on for Matt. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could provide an update on Project Bernini and maybe how customer reception has been and where we are in developing other foundational models or just the monetization opportunity there? Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, first off, before I comment on Bernini, as you might have heard from AU, AI is embedded in everything we're doing from a bottom-up and a top-down perspective. And you also heard us talk at AU about new types of foundation models we're building that understand how certain things are done in our applications. You heard about a foundation model that's driving automated drawing creation. You heard about a foundation model that's driving automated sketch generation and sketch constraints. That kind of stuff is bottom-up innovation. Bernini more of a top-down type innovation where you're actually specifying things and trying to generate a preliminary outcome from those specifications. And what we've been doing with Bernini is we've been trying to engage with certain targeted customers to get them to participate with us in making Bernini smarter and more intelligent. It's not available commercially right now. but it's getting more intelligent. We've actually been successful in getting some customers to stand up and say, look, yes, I'd like to work with you to make this more intelligent because we need something that actually understands 3D geometry as geometry, not just in the picture or something, OK? So, that's what's going on with Bernini right now, and you should continue to see refinements and extensions of that moving forward. Now with regard to monetization, monetization, nobody knows exactly how all this is going to be monetized. But there's a few vectors here that that come into play. One, we are ahead of our competitors in this space. We intend to be ahead. We're investing to stay ahead. That increase ones competitive position in the marketplace, and that's really important. Also, you get to be able to charge for some of these incremental features in the future. When you're delivering value or a high-quality outcome as a result, you're going to charge for that outcome. How we charge for those things? Let's just play out, OK? It's still early days. But there's also monetization opportunities through licensing certain technologies for specific mature maturation for specific customers' needs, all right? And that will be another avenue. So, how these avenues play out, which one waits more, let this play out. But what you need to know about Autodesk is we're ahead. We've been ahead for a while. We were the first out there with an AI research lab that been out there for over six years. It's published 70 papers. We're right on the cutting edge of 3D design technology in AI, and we intend to stay there. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of J.P. Morgan. Your question please, Steve. Stephen Tusa -- Analyst Good evening or afternoon. Lots of good questions asked. Just a detailed one. What's the change in the billings contribution from the transaction model change? The five to six to five to five and a half. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Yeah. So, it's basically because we did more buy/sell business ahead of the European launch. It's short answer. So, remember, we said 5% to 6% when we launched Europe. And it was the -- we did more buy sell business, which means there's less tailwind from the new transaction model. The flip side of -- that means that the underlying increase in our billings guidance is greater than it looks on a headline basis. Stephen Tusa -- Analyst OK, great. Thanks a lot. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Tilton of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Hey, guys, can you hear me? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Great. I have a kind of a high-level one on the incoming CFO. If I heard correctly, we didn't exactly get like an initial outlook for revenue growth for next year. And I'm just trying to understand in the context of the new CFO coming in, is there anything that could change the calculus of how you guys think about that 10% to 15% growth for the underlying business outside of the agency transition that's ongoing today. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Well, first, let's talk about that framework a little bit, and then I'll comment a little bit on the incoming CFO. So, look, the 10% to 15% growth. Right now, we're pretty much right at the bottom end of that range. And if we look back over the last two years, there's been a series of things that created headwinds to new business. It started off with things like the pandemic, the inflation, the exiting of the Russian business, the writer's strike, the whole trade wars within particular geographies. All of these things were accumulated headwinds that build slowly into the business and have pushed us down to the low end of the range. it takes time in a subscription model for those things to build out of the business, OK? So, it's going to take time for us to build out of that. That's to be expected with a subscription model. The revenue goes down slowly. It goes back up slowly as headwinds turn into tailwinds. So, expect us to be near the bottom of that range in the short term just as a general kind of guideline for the core business to be at the bottom of the range, OK? As a long-term framework, the 10% to 15% still makes sense as a long-term guide for the company. But of course, as new eyes come in, we'll look at these things, and we'll evaluate them. But right now, this all still makes sense. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Super helpful. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho. Your question, please. Siti Panigrahi -- Analyst Thanks for taking my question. I understand the new business model of some kind of noise in your expense and margin side. But if you exclude that, where do you see some of the operating leverage that you can drive in next year or so? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, I think we've actually provided kind of historically what we've done over the last three years pretty clearly. And I think we said that we continue to be focused on expansion, but nothing further to add as far as next year. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director We did provide data on that. So, you can see what underlying thing is, and we expect to see continued improvement in that same vector. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations On the same basis. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director On the same basis, on the same apples-to-apples basis. Siti Panigrahi -- Analyst OK, great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Funk of Bank of America. Your question, please. Michael Funk -- Analyst Yeah. Guys, thank you for the question tonight. Two, if I could. You've mentioned a few times in the last calls about the largest multiyear cohort renewing next year and then also a large EBA cohort. Just wondering if you can give us kind of the range of potential outcomes among the renewals there, whether a potential to upsell, risk of down sell and what that variance might look like around those renewals? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer No. I mean I think what we have said is that it's the largest cohort and we saw that performance in '23. And so, we expect a strong renewal year, but we're not giving any specific guidance on what that looks like for '26 at this point, and we'll wait until we report earnings in February. Michael Funk -- Analyst OK. Great. And then, Betsy, one more. You've mentioned a few times after the investment in new transaction model, people processes, and automation, presumably more fixed cost versus variable like commission. Can you quantify that for us to help us with modeling as we try to forecast margin? I know you've not given guidance, but better understanding of what that cost might actually be on an absolute basis would help us to think about our modeling. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Mike, we've got a slide in the earnings deck to help you think about modeling. And I'll just point you to that. Michael Funk -- Analyst OK, great. Thank you, Simon. Operator Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for Q&A today. I would now like to turn the conference back to Simon Mays-Smith for closing remarks. Sir? Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Great. Thanks, Latif, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Looking forward to seeing many of you on the road over the next few weeks. If you have any questions in the meantime, please email me or call me. And in the meantime, for those of you in North America wishing you a very happy Thanksgiving. Thank you, Latif.

that's true, would maybe compare contrast larger-scale m&a that's happening peer space? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah. so, look, consolidation space inevitable. going comment specific deals, here's say. autodesk always acquisitive company, inquisitive company make strategic financial sense company. joe vruwink -- analyst ok. thank you. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director thank you, joe. operator thank you. next question come line elizabeth porter morgan stanley. please go ahead, elizabeth. elizabeth porter -- analyst great, thanks much question. partner getting customer running new transaction model, picked spending little bit time usual time resource existing customers. so, curious impact new business demand kind recently -- broadly, change new business trend think call versus last quarter? betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer yeah. elizabeth, betsy. so, broadly speaking, continue see growth, slower pace due number factor really last several years, macro, covid, exiting russia, elections, drag forward momentum business, really factored guidance. so, kind leave that. elizabeth porter -- analyst great. follow-up billings. understand there's lot volatility around change multiyear transaction model. look like guidance implies bigger step growth q4, despite easier year-ago compare. so, hoping could help u unpack balance headwind tailwind would drive kind greater downtick growth q4. betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer well, again, let start fiscal '25 perspective. billing tailwind going final shift annual billings, new transaction model early renewals. going get headwind co-terming business booked ahead new transaction model launch recent weeks, fx. so, again, think continued perform well executed q3. so, think feel very, strongly expectation q4. elizabeth porter -- analyst great. thank you. operator thank you. next question come line bhavin shah deutsche bank. question please, bhavin. bhavin shah -- analyst great, thanks taking question, congrats quarter. andrew, university, appeared noticeable uptick attendance session geared toward owner operators. driving recent interest segment?

betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer well, wish could give answer, think new cfo would probably little bit problem that. so, wait till end february give specific that. bhavin shah -- analyst fair enough. thanks taking may questions. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director good try. operator thank you. next question come line tyler radke citi. please go ahead, tyler. tyler radke -- analyst yeah, good afternoon. thanks taking questions. going ask placeholder next year's guidance, betsy. want waste question that, feel free answer. andrew, wanted kind ask comment made around efficiency, especially relates hiring janesh, pointed lot experience larger companies, vmware, cisco, et cetera. quarter transaction model rollout, kind visibility better channel prior channel relationships, direct billing customer. area identified efficiency potential? think efficiency unlock, think incremental free cash flow number next year? embedded already. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director so, many layer question. right. first, let kind answer question series stage dodge ones, ok? so, first off, optimization kind mindset autodesk. something suddenly happens. want reemphasize look right now, year, example, look apples-to-apples comparison, slide decks, disclosed material see non-gaap margin already hitting target set next year year, ok? so, optimization mentality. also heard say new transaction model start roll out, optimization go-to-market effort going critical step u part optimization journey on, that's going deliver margin growth company couple year come, ok? think that's important. long-term driver. getting specifics, ok? think specific probably another time, let kind give sense thing important, right? one drive self-service, right? self-service huge impact customer engage u customer come from, value accretive autodesk, efficiency side, renewal things, also revenue growth side capturing customer directly. thing talked understanding customer better, upsell cross-sell. so, going able lot automation understanding opportunity are, that's going drive efficiencies. moving channel partner away model transactional player solution provider ip provider customers. that's going sort opportunity eliminate duplication effort drive real cost efficiency company moving forward. there's top-line efficiency revenue growth, there's bottom line efficiency well removing redundancy step necessary customer. get lot clarity see u continue move forward go-to-market optimization next year beyond that. tyler radke -- analyst great. follow-up question, andrew, talked really strong net new customer addition within construction cloud, think, doubling year year. also saw make revenue accelerate 28% constant currency. help u understand, think reacceleration durable? sort thinking position there? what's driving strength new customer additions? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director first, let comment make revenues, going go construction. so, make revenue also includes revenue pix thing associated that. however, let's talk fact around construction business think important, right? no. 1 factor continue drive consistent, high growth construction solutions. seeing it. built make numbers, lion's share make numbers. really seeing consistent growth there. that's organically. inorganically, actually executing incredibly well thing like payapps, that's driving acceleration growth. so, decelerating business, ok? actually performing solidly inorganically, accelerating, right? want really clear that. yes, said year year, drove 2x increase new customers. talk that's coming minute. also want highlight thing that's going strengthening already strong position enr 400. so, heard story power construction, great example someone taking competitive rfp say, look, need forward-looking cloud-based solution new technology go end end design construction way operations. chose us. one example gave opening commentary. so, already strengthening position enr 400. qualitative thing driving new customer growth already distribution channel operating scale. u.s., helping u go market effectively, allowing u capture customer effectively place others aren't, part driving that. also, already scale operating internationally distribution channel. so, that's driving international growth us. that's really important driver well as, net new account seeing there. last thing add done construction that, look, heard au, hearing customer lot different places. want end-to-end solution. want licensed version cloud, placing bet next 10 years. want go design construction operations, that's making solution attractive market. operator thank you. next question come line michael turrin well fargo. question, please. michael turrin -- analyst hey, thanks much. appreciate taking questions. commentary call sounded consistent, wondering added detail provide u overall macro spend environment that's maybe progressing across either key product segment geos, whatever split think useful. think trying get sense shade improvement anywhere characterize mainly consistent past couple quarters. thanks. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director michael, think core answer consistency, ok? seeing consistent trend seen -- quarters. there's always put take large business like ours, especially one diver ours. general tone consistent prior quarters. betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer would add there's also lot noise year new transaction model obviously, election leading that. so, hard sparse kind particular behavior. so, think andrew said, call consistent. michael turrin -- analyst yeah, tough us, too. that's keep asking. betsy, congrats transition back given also board. think useful hear chime hiring janesh maybe also comment ensure able hand rein keep progress going key transition company working through. thanks. betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer per se, involved process, quite extensive company recruiting janesh. so, certainly excited board. would also say is, obviously, experience board 11 year well as, deep dive business last six months. one reason staying around end fiscal year, think could really helpful transition janesh. so, much looking forward it. think great finance team, think going fit well, looking forward making happen fast can. michael turrin -- analyst thank you. operator thank you. next question come line matthew hedberg rbc capital markets. question, please, matthew. mike richards -- analyst hey, guys. mike richards matt. thanks taking question. wondering could provide update project bernini maybe customer reception developing foundational model monetization opportunity there?

so, that's what's going bernini right now, continue see refinement extension moving forward. regard monetization, monetization, nobody know exactly going monetized. there's vector come play. one, ahead competitor space. intend ahead. investing stay ahead. increase one competitive position marketplace, that's really important. also, get able charge incremental feature future. delivering value high-quality outcome result, going charge outcome. charge things? let's play out, ok? still early days. there's also monetization opportunity licensing certain technology specific mature maturation specific customers' needs, right? another avenue. so, avenue play out, one wait more, let play out. need know autodesk ahead. ahead while. first ai research lab six years. published 70 papers. right cutting edge 3d design technology ai, intend stay there. operator thank you. next question come line steve tusa j.p. morgan. question please, steve. stephen tusa -- analyst good evening afternoon. lot good question asked. detailed one. what's change billing contribution transaction model change? five six five five half. simon mays-smith -- vice president, investor relation yeah. so, basically buy/sell business ahead european launch. short answer. so, remember, said 5% 6% launched europe. -- buy sell business, mean there's less tailwind new transaction model. flip side -- mean underlying increase billing guidance greater look headline basis. stephen tusa -- analyst ok, great. thanks lot. operator thank you. next question come line joshua tilton wolfe research. line open. joshua tilton -- analyst hey, guys, hear me? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah. joshua tilton -- analyst great. kind high-level one incoming cfo. heard correctly, exactly get like initial outlook revenue growth next year. trying understand context new cfo coming in, anything could change calculus guy think 10% 15% growth underlying business outside agency transition that's ongoing today. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director well, first, let's talk framework little bit, comment little bit incoming cfo. so, look, 10% 15% growth. right now, pretty much right bottom end range. look back last two years, there's series thing created headwind new business. started thing like pandemic, inflation, exiting russian business, writer's strike, whole trade war within particular geographies. thing accumulated headwind build slowly business pushed u low end range. take time subscription model thing build business, ok? so, going take time u build that. that's expected subscription model. revenue go slowly. go back slowly headwind turn tailwinds. so, expect u near bottom range short term general kind guideline core business bottom range, ok? long-term framework, 10% 15% still make sense long-term guide company. course, new eye come in, look things, evaluate them. right now, still make sense. joshua tilton -- analyst super helpful. operator thank you. next question come line siti panigrahi mizuho. question, please. siti panigrahi -- analyst thanks taking question. understand new business model kind noise expense margin side. exclude that, see operating leverage drive next year so?

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Simon Mays-Smith, VP, investor relations. Please go ahead. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Thanks, operator, and good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the third quarter results of Autodesk's fiscal '25. On the line with me is Andrew Anagnost, our CEO; and Betsy Rafael, our interim CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including outlook and related assumptions and on product and strategies. Actual events or results could differ materially. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-Q and the Form 8-K filed with today's press release for important risks and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today. If this call is replayed or reviewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Autodesk disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will quote several numeric or growth changes during this call as we discuss our financial performance. Unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison. All non-GAAP numbers referenced in today's call are reconciled in our press release or Excel financials and other supplemental materials available on our Investor Relations website. And now, I will turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Simon, and welcome, everyone, to the call. We finished the third quarter of the year strongly, delivering 12% revenue growth in constant currency and have again raised full year guidance. This reflects the sustained momentum of the business and successful execution of our strategy, including a smooth implementation of the new transaction model in Western Europe. Once again, opportunity, resilience and discipline underpinned our performance. Last month at Autodesk University in San Diego, we hosted 12,000 registered attendees and another 30,000 online. We showed how granular data in the cloud, organized the data models and connected to everything through APIs to deliver even more valuable and connected solutions for customers and partners and support a much broader ecosystem and marketplace. Customers and channel partners that I spoke with at AU remain cautiously optimistic, a sentiment consistent with the underlying momentum of our business, our growing product usage and BuildingConnected bid activity trends over recent quarters. I left AU with a tremendous sense of purpose and optimism in the ingenuity and persistence of our customers and for the future. On our earnings call last quarter, I set out our secular growth opportunities and our strategy to capitalize on them. I concluded that Autodesk's investment in cloud, platform and AI in pursuit of those opportunities were ahead of its peers. AU was a good demonstration of that. But we're also leading the industry in modernizing our go-to-market motion starting a few years ago with the subscription transition through consumption and self-service enablement and more recently to direct billing. These initiatives enable Autodesk to build larger and more durable direct relationships with its customers and to serve them more efficiently. We have already seen significant benefits from initiatives like these, and there's more to come in the next optimization phase. Taking out the effects on margins from FX and the new transaction model, we still expect to be toward the midpoint of our fiscal '26 non-GAAP operating margin target of 38% to 40% in fiscal '25, a year ahead of schedule. We're confident we will make further improvement in fiscal '26 on the same basis. The new transaction model will enable tighter channel partnerships with less duplication of effort and more digital self-service and automation, which increases customer satisfaction and workforce productivity. It will also create new opportunities for partners Autodesk to earn more with less emphasis on transaction revenue sharing and a greater emphasis on value creation for customers. Once complete, we expect the new transaction model and subsequent go-to-market optimization to increase sales and marketing efficiency and deliver GAAP margins among the best in the industry. Attractive, long-term, secular growth markets, a focused strategy delivering ever more valuable and connected solutions to our customers, and a resilient business are generating strong and sustained momentum, both in absolute terms and relative to peers. Disciplined execution and capital deployment has driven even greater operational velocity and efficiency within Autodesk and will underpin the mechanical build of revenue and free cash flow over the next few years and GAAP margins among the best in the industry. We will continue to deploy capital to offset and buy forward dilution as our free cash flow grows from the fiscal '24 trough. This practice has reduced our share count over the last three years. We have significantly increased our share repurchase authorization to extend this momentum flexibility over the medium term, with the precise trajectory remaining dependent on our debt repayment schedule and the ebb and flow of M&A. In combination, we believe these factors will deliver sustainable shareholder value over many years. Before I conclude, I'd like to formally welcome Janesh to Autodesk. We're excited to welcome Janesh, who brings a wealth of experience and will be instrumental in sustaining Autodesk's growth and enhanced profitability momentum. Of equal importance, I'd like to thank Betsy for stepping in as interim CFO at an important time in the company's journey, and I'm looking forward to continuing to work closely with her as an Autodesk Board member. I will now turn the call over to Betsy to discuss our quarterly financial performance and guidance for the year. I'll then return to provide an update on our strategic growth initiatives. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Andrew. Q3 was another strong quarter. We generated broad-based underlying growth across products and regions. In addition, we saw revenue increases from the new transaction model and M&A which were offset by the absence of enterprise business agreement true-ups from Q3 last year and FX. Our Make products continued to enhance growth, driven by our ongoing strength in construction and Fusion. Overall, macroeconomic policy and geopolitical challenges and the underlying momentum of the business were consistent with the last few quarters, with continued strong renewal rates and headwinds to our new business growth. Total revenue grew 11% and 12% in constant currency. By product, in constant currency, AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT revenue grew 8%. AEC revenue, which was most impacted by the absence of true-up revenues, grew 12%, Manufacturing revenue grew 16% and still comfortably in double digits, excluding upfront revenue. And M&E revenue grew 15% boosted by the PIX acquisition and associated integration adjustments. By region, in constant currency, revenue grew 11% in the Americas which was most impacted by the absence of true-up revenues, 13% in EMEA and 14% in APAC. The mechanical contribution from the new transaction model to revenue was $17 million in the third quarter and $25 million on a year-to-date basis. Direct revenue increased 23% and represented 42% of total revenue, up 4 percentage points from last year, benefiting from strong growth in both EBAs and the Autodesk store and also the natural tailwind to revenue from the new transaction model. Net revenue retention rate remained within the 100% to 110% range at constant exchange rates. Billings increased 28% in the quarter, reflecting a tailwind from the prior-year shift to annual billings for most multiyear contracts, early renewals and the natural tailwind from the transition to the new transaction model. Similar to last quarter, and as expected, co-terming negatively impacted billing ahead of the launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe. The natural contribution from the new transaction model to billing was $72 million in the third quarter and $108 million on a year-to-date basis. Total deferred revenue decreased 9% to $3.7 billion and was again impacted by the transition from upfront to annual billings for multiyear contracts. Total RPO of $6.1 billion and current RPO of $4.0 billion grew 17% and 14%, respectively, which reflects a tailwind from early renewals and the new transaction model and a headwind from the declining contribution of billed and unbilled deferred revenue from large, multiyear and EBA cohorts ahead of renewal in fiscal '26. Excluding these, current RPO growth was broadly consistent with Q2. We do expect the new transaction model and the larger FY '26 renewal cohorts to have a greater impact on both RPO and current RPO growth in Q4 of fiscal '25. Turning to margins. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were broadly low. With Autodesk University shifting back to Q3 this year from Q4 last year, GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins decreased by 2 and 3 percentage points, respectively. The timing effect from AU obviously washes out over the full year. At current course and speed, the ratio of stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue peaked in fiscal '24, will follow by more than a percentage point in fiscal '25 and will be below 10% over time. Free cash flow for the quarter was $199 million. This benefited from some channel partners in Western Europe booking business earlier in the quarter ahead of the transition to the new transaction model really to derisk month one after the transition. This accelerated free cash flow to the third quarter, which was partially offset by the expected negative impact of co-terming in Western Europe. Turning now to capital allocation. We continue to actively manage capital within our framework and deploy it with discipline and focus through the economic cycle to drive long-term shareholder value. As expected, the pace of buybacks picked up in the third quarter. We purchased approximately 1.2 million shares for $319 million at an average price of approximately $269 per share. We will continue to deploy capital to offset and buy forward dilution as our free cash flow grows from the fiscal '24 trough. This practice has reduced our share count by about 5 million shares over the last three years with an average percentage reduction of about 70 basis points per year. We increased the amount authorized under our share repurchase program by $5 billion for a total of approximately $9 billion. This expands our flexibility over the medium term with the precise trajectory remaining dependent on our debt repayment schedule as well as, the ebbs and flow of M&A. Now let me finish with guidance. As we said in the February, the pace of the rollout of the new transaction model will create noise in billings and the P&L. So, we think free cash flow is the best measure of our performance. Taking out that noise, the underlying momentum in the business remains consistent with the expectations embedded in our guidance range for the full year with continued strong renewal rates and headwinds to new business growth. Our sustained momentum in the third quarter and smooth launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe, reduced the likelihood of our more cautious forecast scenario. Given that, we're raising the midpoint of our billing, revenue, margin, earnings per share and free cash flow guidance ranges. So, let me give you a little bit more detail. The underlying momentum of billing is in line with our expectations. Compared to our modeling at the start of the year, the launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe in Q3 and early renewals have been a tailwind for billings, whereas more co-terming, more business done under the old buy-sell model before the launch of the new transaction model and in recent weeks, FX movement have been headwinds for billing. We now estimate that the new transaction model will provide between a 5 and 5.5 percentage point tailwind to billings growth in fiscal '25. We've raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 billings guidance by $10 million to a range of $5.90 billion to $5.98 billion. The underlying momentum of revenue is also in line with our expectations. We estimate the new transaction model will provide around 1 to 1.5 percentage point tailwind to revenue growth in fiscal '25. Upfront revenue contributed 2 percentage points to revenue growth in Q4 of fiscal '24, and therefore, this is a headwind in Q4 of fiscal '25. While not large enough to call out at the start of the year, it was already factored into our Q4 and our full year model. We've raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 revenue guidance range by $18 million to a range of $6.12 billion to $6.13 billion. We're increasing our GAAP and non-GAAP margin guidance midpoint by 25 basis points by raising the bottom end of the ranges by 50 basis points. The GAAP margin guidance range is now 21.5% to 22%. The non-GAAP margin guidance range is now 35.5% to 36%, which includes a 1 to 1.5 percentage point underlying margin improvement, broadly offset by the margin headwinds from the new transaction model and the related incremental investments in people, processes and automation. The underlying momentum of free cash flow is also in line with our expectations. The headwind to billings from co-terming and FX rates that I mentioned earlier, is being offset by early renewals, faster collections and improved underlying margins. We raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 free cash flow guidance by $10 million and tightened the range to $1.47 billion to $1.5 billion. We expect strong free cash flow growth in fiscal '26 because of the return of our largest multiyear renewal cohort the natural mechanical stacking of multiyear contracts billed annually and a larger EBA cohort. With our current trajectory, we still estimate free cash flow in fiscal '26 to be around $2.05 billion at the midpoint. The slide deck on our website has more details on modeling assumptions for Q3 and for the full fiscal year '25. And while this may be my last earnings call for Autodesk, I will stick around for a bit to ensure a smooth transition to Janesh. Thank you, Andrew, and everyone at Autodesk for your support while I was here and to the many investors and the analysts with whom I've had lively discussions over the last few quarters. While the transition to annual billings for multiyear contracts and the deployment of the new transaction model has created noise and billings in the P&L, they do provide a natural near-term tailwind to revenue and free cash flow growth. Combined with a resilient business model, sustained competitive momentum, Autodesk has enviable sources of visibility and certainty to very uncertain world. For all these reasons, I stepped down from my role as interim CFO with tremendous optimism for the future. Andrew, back to you. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Betsy. Let me finish by updating you on our strong progress in the third quarter. We continue to see good momentum in AEC, particularly in infrastructure and construction, fueled by customers consolidating onto our solutions to connect and optimize previously siloed workflows through the cloud. The cornerstone of that growing interest is our comprehensive end-to-end solutions in completing designs, preconstruction, field execution through handover and into operations. This breadth of connected capability enables us to extend our footprint further into infrastructure and construction and also expand our reach into the mid-market. As a sign of our growing momentum as the benefits of our end-to-end solution become more apparent, our construction business continue to perform robustly with net new customers doubling year over year and existing customers' renewal and expansion rates remaining strong. Let me give you a few examples. Power Construction is No. 79 on the Engineering News Record, ENR Top 400 U.S. contractor list. It is a Chicago-based general contractor serving residential and nonresidential end markets. After completing a competitive RFP to replace its legacy project management tool, Power selected Autodesk for its unified construction platform across preconstruction, construction, and DDC. By standardizing on Autodesk Construction Cloud, Power will have a single source of truth for project data, enhanced collaboration capabilities, and streamlined workflows on a single platform. Power Construction was one of two ENR 400 top 100 U.S. contractors that standardized enterprisewide on Autodesk build during the quarter. In Europe, Bouygues, a top 10 ENR 250 international contractor based in France and a leader in sustainable building and infrastructure projects renewed and expanded its EBA in the quarter. Bouygues is continuing to consolidate on Autodesk solutions across the enterprise, including broader adoption of Autodesk Forma, Carbon Insight, and Informed Design to digitize, decarbonize, and industrialize projects. It also significantly increased its commitment to Autodesk Construction Cloud to drive efficiency gains and faster bid response times through better collaboration between design and project teams. Surbana Jurong is No. 23 on ENR's top 225 international design firms. Based in Singapore, it is an urban infrastructure and integrated solutions consulting firm. In Q3, it renewed its third EBA, which included increased investment in Autodesk Construction Cloud and Autodesk Water infrastructure solutions. ACC is helping to scale its operations through increased automation, integrated design workflows and enhanced collaboration across time zones. Our water infrastructure solutions will be a core technology supporting its growth ambitions in planning, designing, engineering and managing water projects for customers worldwide. Again, these stories have a common theme. Managing people, processes and data across the project life cycle to increase efficiency and sustainability while decreasing risk. Over time, we expect the majority of all projects to be managed this way, and we remain focused on enabling that transition through our industry cloud. Moving on to manufacturing. We made excellent progress on our strategic initiatives. Customers continue to invest in their digital transformation and consolidate our Design and Make platform. Fusion remains one of the fastest-growing products in the manufacturing industry. As customers seek to drive innovation and growth at lower cost, Fusion extension attach rates are increasing, which is helping to drive the average sales price higher. For example, in the quarter, a global manufacturer supplying the semiconductor industry selected Fusion Manage and Vault PLM over competitive solutions to foster greater collaboration across manufacturing sites and improve operating efficiency. Once fully scaled and operational, this customer expects to save 105,000 hours per year by connecting people and data, resulting in reduced product development costs and faster time to market. In the U.K., Playdale Playground has been designing, manufacturing, and installing outdoor playground equipment for over 40 years. This quarter, Playdale added Fusion to its existing portfolio of Autodesk solutions, including Inventor, AutoCAD, and Vault to streamline and digitize workflows, optimize production to reduce lead times, reduce nonconformities, and replace inefficient Excel-driven operations on the shop floor. A long time Autodesk customer and global leader in precision engineering solutions renewed and expanded its EBA in the quarter. In addition to Inventor, vault and AutoCAD, it is adopting Fusion's generative design capabilities for material waste reduction and fluid flow optimization and Moldflow to reduce manufacturing costs and defects while increasing mold yields. In education, universities continue to modernize their courses and curriculum to attract and prepare future engineers. For example, from this winter, students at the University of Stuttgart, Institute for Medical Device Technology will use Fusion across six courses. Fusion was selected to replace a competitive solution for its modern platform, ease of use, cloud collaboration capabilities and unique combination of PCB and additive manufacturing workflows in a single team environment. And lastly, we continue to work with our customers to ensure they are using the latest and most secure versions of our software. For example, after a period of rapid scaling and diversification, a large multinational manufacturing company in APAC was looking to align compliance rates across its global employee base. Working collaboratively we address compliance issues while cementing a long-term partnership and completing one of our largest ever license compliance agreements, which included expanded adoption of Alias and VRED for the Design Studio and PDMC for mechanical engineering and rail design. Attractive long-term secular growth markets, a focused strategy delivering ever more valuable and connected solutions to our customers and a resilient business are generating strong and sustained momentum both in absolute terms and relative to peers. Disciplined execution and capital deployment is driving an even greater operational velocity and efficiency within Autodesk, and we continue to deploy capital to deliver sustainable shareholder value over many years. I retain a tremendous sense of purpose and optimism in the ingenuity and persistence of our customers and for the future. Operator, we would now like to open the call up for questions. Questions & Answers: Operator Thank you. [Operator instructions] Again, please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Jason Celino of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your question, please. Jason Celino -- Analyst Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Just two for me. The first one, Andrew. Some of us are unfamiliar with Janesh. Can you just tell us a little bit more about him and what he brings to Autodesk? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director I certainly can. Before I do that, let me make sure that I thank Betsy for everything she brought to Autodesk during this interim period. I really appreciate it. The company appreciates it. Thank you, Betsy. Now we're really excited about Janesh. Let me tell you why we're excited about Janesh. As you remember, one of the things I was telling you that I was looking for was someone that was going to be able to dispassionately drive optimization at scale inside of Autodesk. And what that really means is someone that's going to be really inwardly focused, looking at every dollar that we invest and making sure that we're getting the most return for the business that investors are getting the best return from their business. The next kind of criteria we were looking for, which was nice to have was, time in the seat as a sitting CFO, which was important for us as well. But it was kind of the next nice to have after the optimization at scale. Janesh brings a great balance of both of those things, right? He's been in the seat seven years at Elastic, both CFO and COO, driving some fairly turbulent changes inside of Elastic. So, he's got battle stars from pushing inside the company to get changes done inside, and we like that. We like that a lot. He's also got very good early experience at companies that we feel have always added value to Autodesk. So, he was it VMware in a senior position. He was at Cisco in a senior position. We've had good success bringing people from those kind of companies. He worked at those companies driving optimization at scale, which is the No. 1 criteria I was looking for when we we're driving this work. He also has another nice to have. He's got knowledge of our industry. He spent two years at PTC in his career. He was actually recently on the PTC board. So, he understands our industry, and he'll be able to get up to speed pretty quickly. The No. 1 goal here drive optimization and scale over the next few years, make sure that we're getting everything we need from every dollar we invest, which is a very important theme for Autodesk. And with that, I'm really excited, and I'm looking forward to him joining in December. Jason Celino -- Analyst OK. Great. Interesting. And then for my second question, now that you do have a CFO, do you have any thoughts on when you might hold the next Investor Day? I think in the past, you usually did it in March. Is that a good time frame? Or is that too soon? Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. Well, Janesh is joining in December. I think we need to give him time to get his sea legs on giving time to kind of drive the end of the year and actually get us set up for next fiscal year in good stead. So, I would say it's unlikely we'll be doing anything in the spring, but we'll get back to you on that as soon as Janesh is ready to talk about those things. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Your question, please. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst Thank you. Andrew, as of the third quarter, your three-year CAGR for current RPO is about 12%. How are you thinking about the sustainability or perhaps improvement upon that CAGR or CRPO over the next number of years? When we think about the ingredients of that, it looks like over the last several years, the CAGR for your unit volume for all brands is roughly 6% to 7% in the aggregate. So, on top of that, you've had price and other ingredients, but perhaps talk about how you think you might be able to improve upon the most recent trajectory for current RPO. Then my follow-up. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Hi, Jay, this is Betsy. Let me just give you a couple of things. There's a number of things that are going on, on the headline of the CRPO number. If you first take away the headwinds and the tailwinds was broadly consistent with the second quarter. And as I mentioned in my opening commentary, early renewals and growth with -- and the new transaction model are providing a tailwind. And then there's also a headwind to CRPO growth from the declining contribution of billed and unbilled deferred revenue risk from the large multiyear EBA cohorts coming up for renewal in fiscal '26. And just as a reminder, these are the same larger cohorts we are calling out as the tailwinds to free cash flow for next year. And if you look back to fiscal '22, we saw the same dynamic ahead of the fiscal '23 renewals as well. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst OK. Since new management is part of the news this evening, could you talk about how you're thinking about the chief revenue officer position. Would it make sense perhaps to continue to have a separate CRO? Or do you think it might make more sense perhaps to combine CRO and COO? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, we're going to continue to have a separate CRO because we have various functions that work together there under the COO organization, including our IT organization, our infrastructure and all things associated. What we're looking for in our CRO is someone that understands how to continue to drive a business when you have direct engagement with the customer. So, that means someone that really understands what it takes to analyze self-service patterns, actually understand the data that comes in from the customers to help drive cross-sell and upsell while also transforming a channel from a transactionally focused extension of Autodesk to kind of a solution partner that's driving life cycle solutions for our customers. So, that's the kind of role we're looking for here. And yes, it's going to continue to be a stand-alone CRO role within the COO organization. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Borg of Stifel. Your line is open. Adam Borg -- Analyst Awesome. Thanks so much for taking the questions, and congrats to Betsy and Janesh. Maybe on the new transaction model. I know it's still early. But I was just curious, are there any learnings from those customers that are on the new model that you're seeing in terms of the adoption of Autodesk technology and the ability to find white space to better upsell and cross-sell different solutions now that you have a more direct relationship. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah, Adam, it's really early on to be able to make any kind of conclusions about that. What I can tell you is that we definitely see some shifts to some of the direct channels at Autodesk for customers that were probably just served on a very kind of arm's length kind of transactional level. But in terms of driving cross-sell and upsell, early days, early days. But if you want to get a sense for how that might evolve, we've got experience with our EBAs and our enterprise business agreements. And we've learned over the years that having that kind of relationship with the customer where we really understand their usage patterns, who they are and what they're doing, we are much more effective at driving cross-sell and upsell even when partnering with our channel partners. So, I think those kind of stand as a testament of what's possible as we move forward with completion of the new transaction model. Adam Borg -- Analyst Great. And maybe just as a quick follow-up. Just as we think about the new administration coming in, you talked about the macro being broadly consistent. Any change in tone in your conversations with the end markets in terms of optimism or their ability or willingness to expand new projects ahead of the administration? Any pause or just full steam ahead? I'm just curious, any commentary you have there from a macro perspective would be really, really helpful. Thanks so much. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director What I'll say is the things that matter to our customers are bipartisan things, all right? Our customers care about infrastructure builds out. Both parties care about infrastructure build-outs. Our customers care about domestic manufacturing in Europe, be it in the United States, both parties agree that the domestic manufacturing build-outs are important. Supply chain, independent, supply chain stability. All of these things are bipartisan issues that really affect our customers. So, regardless of the administration, I suspect the things that are important to our customers are continuing to be a focus. Adam Borg -- Analyst Thanks, again. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink of Baird. Please go ahead, Joe. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst Thank you. On the outlook for next year, $2.050 billion in free cash has, I think, been the expectation for the past year now. Within the last year, you've also seen more co-term of contracts. And I think that leads to better billings in FY '26. So, my question is, does that actually create the potential that things are better, and that's why you're qualifying now the $2.050 billion as the midpoint of possibilities. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer There's no change to how we've talked about the free cash flow guide for fiscal '26, it continues to be $2.05 billion at the mid-point. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst OK. Fair enough. And then just on the M&A environment, over recent history, Autodesk has been more in a mode of, I would say, strategic tuck-ins. I think there is actually an asset in the CFD simulation space that was announced during AU in the quarter. Is that the right approach for Autodesk, just given this point in time, all the work you've done to build out the cloud platform, the data models, and so these tuck-ins make the most sense? And if that's true, how would you maybe compare and contrast some of the larger-scale M&A that's happening with your peers in the space? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, look, consolidation in our space is inevitable. I'm not going to comment on any specific deals, but here's what I'll say. Autodesk has always been an acquisitive company, and we will be an inquisitive company when that makes both strategic and financial sense for the company. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst OK. Thank you. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Joe. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Porter of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Elizabeth. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great, thanks so much for the question. As partners are getting customers just up and running on the new transaction model, we picked up that they're spending a little bit more time than usual of time and resources with those existing customers. So, I was curious if that had any impact on new business demand kind of more recently -- and then just more broadly, any change in new business trends that you think you should call out from versus last quarter? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Elizabeth, it's Betsy. And so, just broadly speaking, we continue to see growth, but at a slower pace due to a number of factors really over the last several years, macro, COVID, exiting Russia, elections, and while a drag on the forward momentum of the business, all of that really factored into our guidance. So, I kind of just will leave it at that. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great. And then a follow-up just on billings. I understand there's a lot of volatility around the change from multiyear in the transaction model. But it looks like guidance implies a bigger step down in growth in Q4, just despite easier year-ago compare. So, hoping that you could help us unpack the balance of those headwinds and tailwinds that would drive kind of a greater downtick in growth in Q4. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, again, let me start out with just from a fiscal '25 perspective. Your billing tailwinds are going to be from the final shift to annual billings, new transaction model and early renewals. And you're going to get headwinds from co-terming and business booked ahead of the new transaction model launch and in recent weeks, some FX. So, again, I think that we've continued to perform well as we've executed through through Q3. And so, I think we feel very, very strongly about our expectations for Q4. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bhavin Shah of Deutsche Bank. Your question please, Bhavin. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Great, thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the quarter. Andrew, at university, there appeared to be a noticeable uptick in attendance and sessions geared toward owners and operators. What been driving the recent interest from the segment? How much of it is product enhancements you guys have made versus really more focusing and emphasizing from a go-to-market perspective? And how long before this segment of buyers kind of becomes more meaningful to the financials? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah, Bhavin, that's an excellent question, right. We're very interested in tackling the whole entire life cycle from design, through make, construction, manufacturing, all the way into operations. You're probably aware we have a product called Tandem. And a lot of those sessions were driven by increasing interest and increasing adoption of Tandem, which is a digital twin solution, tightly coupled to our solutions that also has a toolkit that allows people to easily connect sensor data through the digital twin solution. So, you're seeing that uptick because we're directly releasing products and capabilities that are of interest to the owner space. You can expect to see that trend continue over time, and you can expect to see us continue to talk about the owner space, continue to deliver solutions for the owner space and even APIs for the owner space. It's an area of great interest, especially when it comes not only to vertical buildings, but factories and other things that are related to that as well as, infrastructure like what we were doing with some of our water owner solutions. So, yes, owners matter. We're building software for them, and you're going to see more of that. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Super helpful there. And then, Betsy, one for you. Just in terms of the underlying improvement that we've been seeing in the margins, and I know you've called out FX and the transaction model. I know it's very early, but as you think about next year, how do we think about like the impact of FX and the transaction model to kind of the headline operating margins? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, I wish I could give you that answer, but I think that the new CFO would probably have a little bit of a problem with that. So, we'll wait till the end of February to give you more specifics on that. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Fair enough. Thanks for taking may questions. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Good try. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke of Citi. Please go ahead, Tyler. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Yeah, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I was going to ask you about a placeholder for next year's guidance, Betsy. don't want to waste a question on that, but feel free to answer. But Andrew, I wanted to kind of ask you about some of your comments you made around efficiency, especially as it relates to hiring Janesh, who you pointed out has a lot of experience at larger companies, VMware, Cisco, et cetera. Now that you're a few quarters into this transaction model rollout, you have kind of visibility better on some of the channel prior channel relationships, having that direct billing with the customer. What are some of the areas that you've identified as having that efficiency potential? And then as we think about that efficiency unlock, should we think about that as incremental to the free cash flow number you have out for next year? Or is that embedded in that already. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director So, many layers to that question. All right. First, let me kind of answer the question in a series of stages then dodge other ones, OK? So, first off, optimization is kind of a mindset at Autodesk. It's not something that that suddenly happens. I want to reemphasize that because if you look right now, this year, for example, when you look at the apples-to-apples comparison, which will be in the slide decks, are in our disclosed materials you can see that our non-GAAP margins are already hitting the targets we set for next year this year, OK? So, optimization is a mentality. You've also heard me say over and over again as the new transaction model starts to roll out, optimization of our go-to-market efforts is going to be a critical step for us and part of the optimization journey that we're on, that's going to deliver margin growth for the company for couple of years to come, OK? And I think that's important. It's a long-term driver. Now with getting into the specifics, OK? I think the specifics are probably for another time, but let me just kind of give you a sense for some of the things that are important, right? One is the drive to self-service, right? Self-service is a huge impact on how our customers will engage with us and where those customers come from, and that is value accretive to Autodesk, both on an efficiency side, from renewals and other things, but also on the revenue growth side through capturing the customers directly. The other thing I talked about is understanding the customer better, so the upsell and cross-sell. So, we're going to be able to do a lot more automation and understanding about where the opportunities are, and that's going to drive some efficiencies. And we're moving the channel partners away from this model of being the transactional players to being the solution providers and the IP providers to our customers. That's going to have all sorts of opportunities to eliminate duplication of effort and drive real cost efficiencies for the company moving forward. There's both top-line efficiencies here in revenue growth, but there's bottom line efficiencies as well through removing the redundancies and steps that just aren't necessary for the customer. You'll get a lot more clarity on that as you see us continue to move forward with this go-to-market optimization in the next year and beyond that. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Great. And then my follow-up question, Andrew, you talked about some really strong net new customer additions within the Construction Cloud, I think, doubling year over year. we also saw the Make revenue accelerate to 28% constant currency. Can you just help us understand, do you think that reacceleration is durable? And how are you sort of thinking about just your position there? What's been driving that strength in the new customer additions? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director First, let me comment on the make revenues, then I'm going to go into construction. So, the make revenue also includes some revenue from PIX and things associated with that. However, let's talk about the facts around our construction business because I think this is important, right? No. 1 factor is that we continue to drive consistent, high growth in our construction solutions. You're seeing it. It's built into the Make numbers, and it's the lion's share of those Make numbers. You're really seeing some consistent growth there. That's organically. Inorganically, we're actually executing incredibly well on things like Payapps, and that's driving acceleration of our growth. So, we are not decelerating as a business, OK? We are actually performing solidly inorganically, we're accelerating, all right? And I just want to be really clear about that. And yes, we said year over year, we drove a 2x increase in our new customers. And I'll talk about where some of that's coming from in just a minute. But I also want to highlight the other thing that's going on we are strengthening an already strong position in the ENR 400. So, you heard about the story about power construction, which was a great example of someone taking out a competitive RFP and say, look, I need a forward-looking cloud-based solution on new technology that goes end to end from design to construction all the way to operations. And they chose us. And that was just one example that we gave in the opening commentary. So, already a strengthening position in the ENR 400. Now the other qualitative things that are driving some of that new customer growth is we already have our distribution channel operating at scale. In the U.S., this is helping us go down market more effectively, which is allowing us to capture more customers more effectively be places where we weren't before and where others aren't, which is part of driving that. But also, we're already at scale operating internationally with our distribution channel. So, that's driving international growth for us. And that's a really important driver as well as, some of those net new accounts that you're seeing there. And the last thing I'll add that I'm done with construction is that, look, I heard this over and over again at AU, I'm hearing it over and over again from customers in lots of different places. They want the end-to-end solution. They want the licensed version in the cloud, they're placing bets for the next 10 years. They want to go from design to construction to operations, and that's just making our solution more attractive to the market. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo. Your question, please. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Hey, thanks very much. I appreciate you taking the questions. A commentary on the call sounded consistent, but wondering if there are any added details you can provide for us on just the overall macro spend environment and how that's maybe progressing across either key product segments or geos, whatever split you think is more useful. I think what we're trying to get a sense for is if there are any shades of improvement anywhere or if you'd characterize as mainly just consistent over the past couple of quarters. Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Michael, I think the core answer here is consistency, OK? We're seeing consistent trends that we've seen with -- in all the other quarters. There's always puts and takes in a large business like ours, especially ones as divers as ours. But the general tone is consistent with prior quarters. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer And I would just add that there's also been a lot of noise this year from the new transaction model and then obviously, the elections and leading up to that. And so, it's hard to sparse out kind of that particular behavior. So, I think as Andrew said, we call it consistent. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Yeah, tough for us, too. That's why we keep asking. Betsy, congrats on the transition back given you're also on the board. I think it'd be useful to hear you chime in on the hiring of Janesh and maybe just also comment on how you ensure you're able to hand over the reins and keep progress going on the key transitions the company is working through. Thanks. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Per se, I was involved in the process, which was quite extensive in the company and the recruiting of Janesh. And so, we're certainly very excited to have him on board. What I would also say is, obviously, with my experience of being on the board for 11 years as well as, my deep dive into the business over the last six months. One of the reasons I'm staying around until the end of the fiscal year, is I think I could be really helpful in that transition for Janesh. And so, I'm very much looking forward to it. And I think that we have a great finance team, and I think that he's going to fit very well, and I'm looking forward to making that happen as fast as we can. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. Your question, please, Matthew. Mike Richards -- Analyst Hey, guys. This is Mike Richards on for Matt. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could provide an update on Project Bernini and maybe how customer reception has been and where we are in developing other foundational models or just the monetization opportunity there? Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, first off, before I comment on Bernini, as you might have heard from AU, AI is embedded in everything we're doing from a bottom-up and a top-down perspective. And you also heard us talk at AU about new types of foundation models we're building that understand how certain things are done in our applications. You heard about a foundation model that's driving automated drawing creation. You heard about a foundation model that's driving automated sketch generation and sketch constraints. That kind of stuff is bottom-up innovation. Bernini more of a top-down type innovation where you're actually specifying things and trying to generate a preliminary outcome from those specifications. And what we've been doing with Bernini is we've been trying to engage with certain targeted customers to get them to participate with us in making Bernini smarter and more intelligent. It's not available commercially right now. but it's getting more intelligent. We've actually been successful in getting some customers to stand up and say, look, yes, I'd like to work with you to make this more intelligent because we need something that actually understands 3D geometry as geometry, not just in the picture or something, OK? So, that's what's going on with Bernini right now, and you should continue to see refinements and extensions of that moving forward. Now with regard to monetization, monetization, nobody knows exactly how all this is going to be monetized. But there's a few vectors here that that come into play. One, we are ahead of our competitors in this space. We intend to be ahead. We're investing to stay ahead. That increase ones competitive position in the marketplace, and that's really important. Also, you get to be able to charge for some of these incremental features in the future. When you're delivering value or a high-quality outcome as a result, you're going to charge for that outcome. How we charge for those things? Let's just play out, OK? It's still early days. But there's also monetization opportunities through licensing certain technologies for specific mature maturation for specific customers' needs, all right? And that will be another avenue. So, how these avenues play out, which one waits more, let this play out. But what you need to know about Autodesk is we're ahead. We've been ahead for a while. We were the first out there with an AI research lab that been out there for over six years. It's published 70 papers. We're right on the cutting edge of 3D design technology in AI, and we intend to stay there. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of J.P. Morgan. Your question please, Steve. Stephen Tusa -- Analyst Good evening or afternoon. Lots of good questions asked. Just a detailed one. What's the change in the billings contribution from the transaction model change? The five to six to five to five and a half. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Yeah. So, it's basically because we did more buy/sell business ahead of the European launch. It's short answer. So, remember, we said 5% to 6% when we launched Europe. And it was the -- we did more buy sell business, which means there's less tailwind from the new transaction model. The flip side of -- that means that the underlying increase in our billings guidance is greater than it looks on a headline basis. Stephen Tusa -- Analyst OK, great. Thanks a lot. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Tilton of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Hey, guys, can you hear me? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Great. I have a kind of a high-level one on the incoming CFO. If I heard correctly, we didn't exactly get like an initial outlook for revenue growth for next year. And I'm just trying to understand in the context of the new CFO coming in, is there anything that could change the calculus of how you guys think about that 10% to 15% growth for the underlying business outside of the agency transition that's ongoing today. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Well, first, let's talk about that framework a little bit, and then I'll comment a little bit on the incoming CFO. So, look, the 10% to 15% growth. Right now, we're pretty much right at the bottom end of that range. And if we look back over the last two years, there's been a series of things that created headwinds to new business. It started off with things like the pandemic, the inflation, the exiting of the Russian business, the writer's strike, the whole trade wars within particular geographies. All of these things were accumulated headwinds that build slowly into the business and have pushed us down to the low end of the range. it takes time in a subscription model for those things to build out of the business, OK? So, it's going to take time for us to build out of that. That's to be expected with a subscription model. The revenue goes down slowly. It goes back up slowly as headwinds turn into tailwinds. So, expect us to be near the bottom of that range in the short term just as a general kind of guideline for the core business to be at the bottom of the range, OK? As a long-term framework, the 10% to 15% still makes sense as a long-term guide for the company. But of course, as new eyes come in, we'll look at these things, and we'll evaluate them. But right now, this all still makes sense. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Super helpful. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho. Your question, please. Siti Panigrahi -- Analyst Thanks for taking my question. I understand the new business model of some kind of noise in your expense and margin side. But if you exclude that, where do you see some of the operating leverage that you can drive in next year or so? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, I think we've actually provided kind of historically what we've done over the last three years pretty clearly. And I think we said that we continue to be focused on expansion, but nothing further to add as far as next year. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director We did provide data on that. So, you can see what underlying thing is, and we expect to see continued improvement in that same vector. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations On the same basis. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director On the same basis, on the same apples-to-apples basis. Siti Panigrahi -- Analyst OK, great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Funk of Bank of America. Your question, please. Michael Funk -- Analyst Yeah. Guys, thank you for the question tonight. Two, if I could. You've mentioned a few times in the last calls about the largest multiyear cohort renewing next year and then also a large EBA cohort. Just wondering if you can give us kind of the range of potential outcomes among the renewals there, whether a potential to upsell, risk of down sell and what that variance might look like around those renewals? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer No. I mean I think what we have said is that it's the largest cohort and we saw that performance in '23. And so, we expect a strong renewal year, but we're not giving any specific guidance on what that looks like for '26 at this point, and we'll wait until we report earnings in February. Michael Funk -- Analyst OK. Great. And then, Betsy, one more. You've mentioned a few times after the investment in new transaction model, people processes, and automation, presumably more fixed cost versus variable like commission. Can you quantify that for us to help us with modeling as we try to forecast margin? I know you've not given guidance, but better understanding of what that cost might actually be on an absolute basis would help us to think about our modeling. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Mike, we've got a slide in the earnings deck to help you think about modeling. And I'll just point you to that. Michael Funk -- Analyst OK, great. Thank you, Simon. Operator Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for Q&A today. I would now like to turn the conference back to Simon Mays-Smith for closing remarks. Sir? Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Great. Thanks, Latif, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Looking forward to seeing many of you on the road over the next few weeks. If you have any questions in the meantime, please email me or call me. And in the meantime, for those of you in North America wishing you a very happy Thanksgiving. Thank you, Latif.

[operator instructions] again, please stand compile q&a roster. first question come line jason celino keybanc capital markets. question, please. jason celino -- analyst hey, thanks taking questions. two me. first one, andrew. u unfamiliar janesh. tell u little bit brings autodesk? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director certainly can. that, let make sure thank betsy everything brought autodesk interim period. really appreciate it. company appreciates it. thank you, betsy. really excited janesh. let tell excited janesh. remember, one thing telling looking someone going able dispassionately drive optimization scale inside autodesk. really mean someone that's going really inwardly focused, looking every dollar invest making sure getting return business investor getting best return business. next kind criterion looking for, nice was, time seat sitting cfo, important u well. kind next nice optimization scale. janesh brings great balance things, right? seat seven year elastic, cfo coo, driving fairly turbulent change inside elastic. so, got battle star pushing inside company get change done inside, like that. like lot. also got good early experience company feel always added value autodesk. so, vmware senior position. cisco senior position. good success bringing people kind companies. worked company driving optimization scale, no. 1 criterion looking driving work. also another nice have. got knowledge industry. spent two year ptc career. actually recently ptc board. so, understands industry, able get speed pretty quickly. no. 1 goal drive optimization scale next years, make sure getting everything need every dollar invest, important theme autodesk. that, really excited, looking forward joining december. jason celino -- analyst ok. great. interesting. second question, cfo, thought might hold next investor day? think past, usually march. good time frame? soon? thanks. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah. well, janesh joining december. think need give time get sea leg giving time kind drive end year actually get u set next fiscal year good stead. so, would say unlikely anything spring, get back soon janesh ready talk things. operator thank you. next question come line jay vleeschhouwer griffin securities. question, please. jay vleeschhouwer -- analyst thank you. andrew, third quarter, three-year cagr current rpo 12%. thinking sustainability perhaps improvement upon cagr crpo next number years? think ingredient that, look like last several years, cagr unit volume brand roughly 6% 7% aggregate. so, top that, price ingredients, perhaps talk think might able improve upon recent trajectory current rpo. follow-up. betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer yeah. hi, jay, betsy. let give couple things. there's number thing going on, headline crpo number. first take away headwind tailwind broadly consistent second quarter. mentioned opening commentary, early renewal growth -- new transaction model providing tailwind. there's also headwind crpo growth declining contribution billed unbilled deferred revenue risk large multiyear eba cohort coming renewal fiscal '26. reminder, larger cohort calling tailwind free cash flow next year. look back fiscal '22, saw dynamic ahead fiscal '23 renewal well. jay vleeschhouwer -- analyst ok. since new management part news evening, could talk thinking chief revenue officer position. would make sense perhaps continue separate cro?

think efficiency unlock, think incremental free cash flow number next year? embedded already. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director so, many layer question. right. first, let kind answer question series stage dodge ones, ok? so, first off, optimization kind mindset autodesk. something suddenly happens. want reemphasize look right now, year, example, look apples-to-apples comparison, slide decks, disclosed material see non-gaap margin already hitting target set next year year, ok? so, optimization mentality. also heard say new transaction model start roll out, optimization go-to-market effort going critical step u part optimization journey on, that's going deliver margin growth company couple year come, ok? think that's important. long-term driver. getting specifics, ok? think specific probably another time, let kind give sense thing important, right? one drive self-service, right? self-service huge impact customer engage u customer come from, value accretive autodesk, efficiency side, renewal things, also revenue growth side capturing customer directly. thing talked understanding customer better, upsell cross-sell. so, going able lot automation understanding opportunity are, that's going drive efficiencies. moving channel partner away model transactional player solution provider ip provider customers. that's going sort opportunity eliminate duplication effort drive real cost efficiency company moving forward. there's top-line efficiency revenue growth, there's bottom line efficiency well removing redundancy step necessary customer. get lot clarity see u continue move forward go-to-market optimization next year beyond that. tyler radke -- analyst great. follow-up question, andrew, talked really strong net new customer addition within construction cloud, think, doubling year year. also saw make revenue accelerate 28% constant currency. help u understand, think reacceleration durable? sort thinking position there? what's driving strength new customer additions? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director first, let comment make revenues, going go construction. so, make revenue also includes revenue pix thing associated that. however, let's talk fact around construction business think important, right? no. 1 factor continue drive consistent, high growth construction solutions. seeing it. built make numbers, lion's share make numbers. really seeing consistent growth there. that's organically. inorganically, actually executing incredibly well thing like payapps, that's driving acceleration growth. so, decelerating business, ok? actually performing solidly inorganically, accelerating, right? want really clear that. yes, said year year, drove 2x increase new customers. talk that's coming minute. also want highlight thing that's going strengthening already strong position enr 400. so, heard story power construction, great example someone taking competitive rfp say, look, need forward-looking cloud-based solution new technology go end end design construction way operations. chose us. one example gave opening commentary. so, already strengthening position enr 400. qualitative thing driving new customer growth already distribution channel operating scale. u.s., helping u go market effectively, allowing u capture customer effectively place others aren't, part driving that. also, already scale operating internationally distribution channel. so, that's driving international growth us. that's really important driver well as, net new account seeing there. last thing add done construction that, look, heard au, hearing customer lot different places. want end-to-end solution. want licensed version cloud, placing bet next 10 years. want go design construction operations, that's making solution attractive market. operator thank you. next question come line michael turrin well fargo. question, please. michael turrin -- analyst hey, thanks much. appreciate taking questions. commentary call sounded consistent, wondering added detail provide u overall macro spend environment that's maybe progressing across either key product segment geos, whatever split think useful. think trying get sense shade improvement anywhere characterize mainly consistent past couple quarters. thanks. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director michael, think core answer consistency, ok?

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Simon Mays-Smith, VP, investor relations. Please go ahead. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Thanks, operator, and good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the third quarter results of Autodesk's fiscal '25. On the line with me is Andrew Anagnost, our CEO; and Betsy Rafael, our interim CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including outlook and related assumptions and on product and strategies. Actual events or results could differ materially. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-Q and the Form 8-K filed with today's press release for important risks and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today. If this call is replayed or reviewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Autodesk disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will quote several numeric or growth changes during this call as we discuss our financial performance. Unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison. All non-GAAP numbers referenced in today's call are reconciled in our press release or Excel financials and other supplemental materials available on our Investor Relations website. And now, I will turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Simon, and welcome, everyone, to the call. We finished the third quarter of the year strongly, delivering 12% revenue growth in constant currency and have again raised full year guidance. This reflects the sustained momentum of the business and successful execution of our strategy, including a smooth implementation of the new transaction model in Western Europe. Once again, opportunity, resilience and discipline underpinned our performance. Last month at Autodesk University in San Diego, we hosted 12,000 registered attendees and another 30,000 online. We showed how granular data in the cloud, organized the data models and connected to everything through APIs to deliver even more valuable and connected solutions for customers and partners and support a much broader ecosystem and marketplace. Customers and channel partners that I spoke with at AU remain cautiously optimistic, a sentiment consistent with the underlying momentum of our business, our growing product usage and BuildingConnected bid activity trends over recent quarters. I left AU with a tremendous sense of purpose and optimism in the ingenuity and persistence of our customers and for the future. On our earnings call last quarter, I set out our secular growth opportunities and our strategy to capitalize on them. I concluded that Autodesk's investment in cloud, platform and AI in pursuit of those opportunities were ahead of its peers. AU was a good demonstration of that. But we're also leading the industry in modernizing our go-to-market motion starting a few years ago with the subscription transition through consumption and self-service enablement and more recently to direct billing. These initiatives enable Autodesk to build larger and more durable direct relationships with its customers and to serve them more efficiently. We have already seen significant benefits from initiatives like these, and there's more to come in the next optimization phase. Taking out the effects on margins from FX and the new transaction model, we still expect to be toward the midpoint of our fiscal '26 non-GAAP operating margin target of 38% to 40% in fiscal '25, a year ahead of schedule. We're confident we will make further improvement in fiscal '26 on the same basis. The new transaction model will enable tighter channel partnerships with less duplication of effort and more digital self-service and automation, which increases customer satisfaction and workforce productivity. It will also create new opportunities for partners Autodesk to earn more with less emphasis on transaction revenue sharing and a greater emphasis on value creation for customers. Once complete, we expect the new transaction model and subsequent go-to-market optimization to increase sales and marketing efficiency and deliver GAAP margins among the best in the industry. Attractive, long-term, secular growth markets, a focused strategy delivering ever more valuable and connected solutions to our customers, and a resilient business are generating strong and sustained momentum, both in absolute terms and relative to peers. Disciplined execution and capital deployment has driven even greater operational velocity and efficiency within Autodesk and will underpin the mechanical build of revenue and free cash flow over the next few years and GAAP margins among the best in the industry. We will continue to deploy capital to offset and buy forward dilution as our free cash flow grows from the fiscal '24 trough. This practice has reduced our share count over the last three years. We have significantly increased our share repurchase authorization to extend this momentum flexibility over the medium term, with the precise trajectory remaining dependent on our debt repayment schedule and the ebb and flow of M&A. In combination, we believe these factors will deliver sustainable shareholder value over many years. Before I conclude, I'd like to formally welcome Janesh to Autodesk. We're excited to welcome Janesh, who brings a wealth of experience and will be instrumental in sustaining Autodesk's growth and enhanced profitability momentum. Of equal importance, I'd like to thank Betsy for stepping in as interim CFO at an important time in the company's journey, and I'm looking forward to continuing to work closely with her as an Autodesk Board member. I will now turn the call over to Betsy to discuss our quarterly financial performance and guidance for the year. I'll then return to provide an update on our strategic growth initiatives. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Andrew. Q3 was another strong quarter. We generated broad-based underlying growth across products and regions. In addition, we saw revenue increases from the new transaction model and M&A which were offset by the absence of enterprise business agreement true-ups from Q3 last year and FX. Our Make products continued to enhance growth, driven by our ongoing strength in construction and Fusion. Overall, macroeconomic policy and geopolitical challenges and the underlying momentum of the business were consistent with the last few quarters, with continued strong renewal rates and headwinds to our new business growth. Total revenue grew 11% and 12% in constant currency. By product, in constant currency, AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT revenue grew 8%. AEC revenue, which was most impacted by the absence of true-up revenues, grew 12%, Manufacturing revenue grew 16% and still comfortably in double digits, excluding upfront revenue. And M&E revenue grew 15% boosted by the PIX acquisition and associated integration adjustments. By region, in constant currency, revenue grew 11% in the Americas which was most impacted by the absence of true-up revenues, 13% in EMEA and 14% in APAC. The mechanical contribution from the new transaction model to revenue was $17 million in the third quarter and $25 million on a year-to-date basis. Direct revenue increased 23% and represented 42% of total revenue, up 4 percentage points from last year, benefiting from strong growth in both EBAs and the Autodesk store and also the natural tailwind to revenue from the new transaction model. Net revenue retention rate remained within the 100% to 110% range at constant exchange rates. Billings increased 28% in the quarter, reflecting a tailwind from the prior-year shift to annual billings for most multiyear contracts, early renewals and the natural tailwind from the transition to the new transaction model. Similar to last quarter, and as expected, co-terming negatively impacted billing ahead of the launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe. The natural contribution from the new transaction model to billing was $72 million in the third quarter and $108 million on a year-to-date basis. Total deferred revenue decreased 9% to $3.7 billion and was again impacted by the transition from upfront to annual billings for multiyear contracts. Total RPO of $6.1 billion and current RPO of $4.0 billion grew 17% and 14%, respectively, which reflects a tailwind from early renewals and the new transaction model and a headwind from the declining contribution of billed and unbilled deferred revenue from large, multiyear and EBA cohorts ahead of renewal in fiscal '26. Excluding these, current RPO growth was broadly consistent with Q2. We do expect the new transaction model and the larger FY '26 renewal cohorts to have a greater impact on both RPO and current RPO growth in Q4 of fiscal '25. Turning to margins. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were broadly low. With Autodesk University shifting back to Q3 this year from Q4 last year, GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins decreased by 2 and 3 percentage points, respectively. The timing effect from AU obviously washes out over the full year. At current course and speed, the ratio of stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue peaked in fiscal '24, will follow by more than a percentage point in fiscal '25 and will be below 10% over time. Free cash flow for the quarter was $199 million. This benefited from some channel partners in Western Europe booking business earlier in the quarter ahead of the transition to the new transaction model really to derisk month one after the transition. This accelerated free cash flow to the third quarter, which was partially offset by the expected negative impact of co-terming in Western Europe. Turning now to capital allocation. We continue to actively manage capital within our framework and deploy it with discipline and focus through the economic cycle to drive long-term shareholder value. As expected, the pace of buybacks picked up in the third quarter. We purchased approximately 1.2 million shares for $319 million at an average price of approximately $269 per share. We will continue to deploy capital to offset and buy forward dilution as our free cash flow grows from the fiscal '24 trough. This practice has reduced our share count by about 5 million shares over the last three years with an average percentage reduction of about 70 basis points per year. We increased the amount authorized under our share repurchase program by $5 billion for a total of approximately $9 billion. This expands our flexibility over the medium term with the precise trajectory remaining dependent on our debt repayment schedule as well as, the ebbs and flow of M&A. Now let me finish with guidance. As we said in the February, the pace of the rollout of the new transaction model will create noise in billings and the P&L. So, we think free cash flow is the best measure of our performance. Taking out that noise, the underlying momentum in the business remains consistent with the expectations embedded in our guidance range for the full year with continued strong renewal rates and headwinds to new business growth. Our sustained momentum in the third quarter and smooth launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe, reduced the likelihood of our more cautious forecast scenario. Given that, we're raising the midpoint of our billing, revenue, margin, earnings per share and free cash flow guidance ranges. So, let me give you a little bit more detail. The underlying momentum of billing is in line with our expectations. Compared to our modeling at the start of the year, the launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe in Q3 and early renewals have been a tailwind for billings, whereas more co-terming, more business done under the old buy-sell model before the launch of the new transaction model and in recent weeks, FX movement have been headwinds for billing. We now estimate that the new transaction model will provide between a 5 and 5.5 percentage point tailwind to billings growth in fiscal '25. We've raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 billings guidance by $10 million to a range of $5.90 billion to $5.98 billion. The underlying momentum of revenue is also in line with our expectations. We estimate the new transaction model will provide around 1 to 1.5 percentage point tailwind to revenue growth in fiscal '25. Upfront revenue contributed 2 percentage points to revenue growth in Q4 of fiscal '24, and therefore, this is a headwind in Q4 of fiscal '25. While not large enough to call out at the start of the year, it was already factored into our Q4 and our full year model. We've raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 revenue guidance range by $18 million to a range of $6.12 billion to $6.13 billion. We're increasing our GAAP and non-GAAP margin guidance midpoint by 25 basis points by raising the bottom end of the ranges by 50 basis points. The GAAP margin guidance range is now 21.5% to 22%. The non-GAAP margin guidance range is now 35.5% to 36%, which includes a 1 to 1.5 percentage point underlying margin improvement, broadly offset by the margin headwinds from the new transaction model and the related incremental investments in people, processes and automation. The underlying momentum of free cash flow is also in line with our expectations. The headwind to billings from co-terming and FX rates that I mentioned earlier, is being offset by early renewals, faster collections and improved underlying margins. We raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 free cash flow guidance by $10 million and tightened the range to $1.47 billion to $1.5 billion. We expect strong free cash flow growth in fiscal '26 because of the return of our largest multiyear renewal cohort the natural mechanical stacking of multiyear contracts billed annually and a larger EBA cohort. With our current trajectory, we still estimate free cash flow in fiscal '26 to be around $2.05 billion at the midpoint. The slide deck on our website has more details on modeling assumptions for Q3 and for the full fiscal year '25. And while this may be my last earnings call for Autodesk, I will stick around for a bit to ensure a smooth transition to Janesh. Thank you, Andrew, and everyone at Autodesk for your support while I was here and to the many investors and the analysts with whom I've had lively discussions over the last few quarters. While the transition to annual billings for multiyear contracts and the deployment of the new transaction model has created noise and billings in the P&L, they do provide a natural near-term tailwind to revenue and free cash flow growth. Combined with a resilient business model, sustained competitive momentum, Autodesk has enviable sources of visibility and certainty to very uncertain world. For all these reasons, I stepped down from my role as interim CFO with tremendous optimism for the future. Andrew, back to you. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Betsy. Let me finish by updating you on our strong progress in the third quarter. We continue to see good momentum in AEC, particularly in infrastructure and construction, fueled by customers consolidating onto our solutions to connect and optimize previously siloed workflows through the cloud. The cornerstone of that growing interest is our comprehensive end-to-end solutions in completing designs, preconstruction, field execution through handover and into operations. This breadth of connected capability enables us to extend our footprint further into infrastructure and construction and also expand our reach into the mid-market. As a sign of our growing momentum as the benefits of our end-to-end solution become more apparent, our construction business continue to perform robustly with net new customers doubling year over year and existing customers' renewal and expansion rates remaining strong. Let me give you a few examples. Power Construction is No. 79 on the Engineering News Record, ENR Top 400 U.S. contractor list. It is a Chicago-based general contractor serving residential and nonresidential end markets. After completing a competitive RFP to replace its legacy project management tool, Power selected Autodesk for its unified construction platform across preconstruction, construction, and DDC. By standardizing on Autodesk Construction Cloud, Power will have a single source of truth for project data, enhanced collaboration capabilities, and streamlined workflows on a single platform. Power Construction was one of two ENR 400 top 100 U.S. contractors that standardized enterprisewide on Autodesk build during the quarter. In Europe, Bouygues, a top 10 ENR 250 international contractor based in France and a leader in sustainable building and infrastructure projects renewed and expanded its EBA in the quarter. Bouygues is continuing to consolidate on Autodesk solutions across the enterprise, including broader adoption of Autodesk Forma, Carbon Insight, and Informed Design to digitize, decarbonize, and industrialize projects. It also significantly increased its commitment to Autodesk Construction Cloud to drive efficiency gains and faster bid response times through better collaboration between design and project teams. Surbana Jurong is No. 23 on ENR's top 225 international design firms. Based in Singapore, it is an urban infrastructure and integrated solutions consulting firm. In Q3, it renewed its third EBA, which included increased investment in Autodesk Construction Cloud and Autodesk Water infrastructure solutions. ACC is helping to scale its operations through increased automation, integrated design workflows and enhanced collaboration across time zones. Our water infrastructure solutions will be a core technology supporting its growth ambitions in planning, designing, engineering and managing water projects for customers worldwide. Again, these stories have a common theme. Managing people, processes and data across the project life cycle to increase efficiency and sustainability while decreasing risk. Over time, we expect the majority of all projects to be managed this way, and we remain focused on enabling that transition through our industry cloud. Moving on to manufacturing. We made excellent progress on our strategic initiatives. Customers continue to invest in their digital transformation and consolidate our Design and Make platform. Fusion remains one of the fastest-growing products in the manufacturing industry. As customers seek to drive innovation and growth at lower cost, Fusion extension attach rates are increasing, which is helping to drive the average sales price higher. For example, in the quarter, a global manufacturer supplying the semiconductor industry selected Fusion Manage and Vault PLM over competitive solutions to foster greater collaboration across manufacturing sites and improve operating efficiency. Once fully scaled and operational, this customer expects to save 105,000 hours per year by connecting people and data, resulting in reduced product development costs and faster time to market. In the U.K., Playdale Playground has been designing, manufacturing, and installing outdoor playground equipment for over 40 years. This quarter, Playdale added Fusion to its existing portfolio of Autodesk solutions, including Inventor, AutoCAD, and Vault to streamline and digitize workflows, optimize production to reduce lead times, reduce nonconformities, and replace inefficient Excel-driven operations on the shop floor. A long time Autodesk customer and global leader in precision engineering solutions renewed and expanded its EBA in the quarter. In addition to Inventor, vault and AutoCAD, it is adopting Fusion's generative design capabilities for material waste reduction and fluid flow optimization and Moldflow to reduce manufacturing costs and defects while increasing mold yields. In education, universities continue to modernize their courses and curriculum to attract and prepare future engineers. For example, from this winter, students at the University of Stuttgart, Institute for Medical Device Technology will use Fusion across six courses. Fusion was selected to replace a competitive solution for its modern platform, ease of use, cloud collaboration capabilities and unique combination of PCB and additive manufacturing workflows in a single team environment. And lastly, we continue to work with our customers to ensure they are using the latest and most secure versions of our software. For example, after a period of rapid scaling and diversification, a large multinational manufacturing company in APAC was looking to align compliance rates across its global employee base. Working collaboratively we address compliance issues while cementing a long-term partnership and completing one of our largest ever license compliance agreements, which included expanded adoption of Alias and VRED for the Design Studio and PDMC for mechanical engineering and rail design. Attractive long-term secular growth markets, a focused strategy delivering ever more valuable and connected solutions to our customers and a resilient business are generating strong and sustained momentum both in absolute terms and relative to peers. Disciplined execution and capital deployment is driving an even greater operational velocity and efficiency within Autodesk, and we continue to deploy capital to deliver sustainable shareholder value over many years. I retain a tremendous sense of purpose and optimism in the ingenuity and persistence of our customers and for the future. Operator, we would now like to open the call up for questions. Questions & Answers: Operator Thank you. [Operator instructions] Again, please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Jason Celino of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your question, please. Jason Celino -- Analyst Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Just two for me. The first one, Andrew. Some of us are unfamiliar with Janesh. Can you just tell us a little bit more about him and what he brings to Autodesk? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director I certainly can. Before I do that, let me make sure that I thank Betsy for everything she brought to Autodesk during this interim period. I really appreciate it. The company appreciates it. Thank you, Betsy. Now we're really excited about Janesh. Let me tell you why we're excited about Janesh. As you remember, one of the things I was telling you that I was looking for was someone that was going to be able to dispassionately drive optimization at scale inside of Autodesk. And what that really means is someone that's going to be really inwardly focused, looking at every dollar that we invest and making sure that we're getting the most return for the business that investors are getting the best return from their business. The next kind of criteria we were looking for, which was nice to have was, time in the seat as a sitting CFO, which was important for us as well. But it was kind of the next nice to have after the optimization at scale. Janesh brings a great balance of both of those things, right? He's been in the seat seven years at Elastic, both CFO and COO, driving some fairly turbulent changes inside of Elastic. So, he's got battle stars from pushing inside the company to get changes done inside, and we like that. We like that a lot. He's also got very good early experience at companies that we feel have always added value to Autodesk. So, he was it VMware in a senior position. He was at Cisco in a senior position. We've had good success bringing people from those kind of companies. He worked at those companies driving optimization at scale, which is the No. 1 criteria I was looking for when we we're driving this work. He also has another nice to have. He's got knowledge of our industry. He spent two years at PTC in his career. He was actually recently on the PTC board. So, he understands our industry, and he'll be able to get up to speed pretty quickly. The No. 1 goal here drive optimization and scale over the next few years, make sure that we're getting everything we need from every dollar we invest, which is a very important theme for Autodesk. And with that, I'm really excited, and I'm looking forward to him joining in December. Jason Celino -- Analyst OK. Great. Interesting. And then for my second question, now that you do have a CFO, do you have any thoughts on when you might hold the next Investor Day? I think in the past, you usually did it in March. Is that a good time frame? Or is that too soon? Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. Well, Janesh is joining in December. I think we need to give him time to get his sea legs on giving time to kind of drive the end of the year and actually get us set up for next fiscal year in good stead. So, I would say it's unlikely we'll be doing anything in the spring, but we'll get back to you on that as soon as Janesh is ready to talk about those things. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Your question, please. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst Thank you. Andrew, as of the third quarter, your three-year CAGR for current RPO is about 12%. How are you thinking about the sustainability or perhaps improvement upon that CAGR or CRPO over the next number of years? When we think about the ingredients of that, it looks like over the last several years, the CAGR for your unit volume for all brands is roughly 6% to 7% in the aggregate. So, on top of that, you've had price and other ingredients, but perhaps talk about how you think you might be able to improve upon the most recent trajectory for current RPO. Then my follow-up. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Hi, Jay, this is Betsy. Let me just give you a couple of things. There's a number of things that are going on, on the headline of the CRPO number. If you first take away the headwinds and the tailwinds was broadly consistent with the second quarter. And as I mentioned in my opening commentary, early renewals and growth with -- and the new transaction model are providing a tailwind. And then there's also a headwind to CRPO growth from the declining contribution of billed and unbilled deferred revenue risk from the large multiyear EBA cohorts coming up for renewal in fiscal '26. And just as a reminder, these are the same larger cohorts we are calling out as the tailwinds to free cash flow for next year. And if you look back to fiscal '22, we saw the same dynamic ahead of the fiscal '23 renewals as well. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst OK. Since new management is part of the news this evening, could you talk about how you're thinking about the chief revenue officer position. Would it make sense perhaps to continue to have a separate CRO? Or do you think it might make more sense perhaps to combine CRO and COO? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, we're going to continue to have a separate CRO because we have various functions that work together there under the COO organization, including our IT organization, our infrastructure and all things associated. What we're looking for in our CRO is someone that understands how to continue to drive a business when you have direct engagement with the customer. So, that means someone that really understands what it takes to analyze self-service patterns, actually understand the data that comes in from the customers to help drive cross-sell and upsell while also transforming a channel from a transactionally focused extension of Autodesk to kind of a solution partner that's driving life cycle solutions for our customers. So, that's the kind of role we're looking for here. And yes, it's going to continue to be a stand-alone CRO role within the COO organization. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Borg of Stifel. Your line is open. Adam Borg -- Analyst Awesome. Thanks so much for taking the questions, and congrats to Betsy and Janesh. Maybe on the new transaction model. I know it's still early. But I was just curious, are there any learnings from those customers that are on the new model that you're seeing in terms of the adoption of Autodesk technology and the ability to find white space to better upsell and cross-sell different solutions now that you have a more direct relationship. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah, Adam, it's really early on to be able to make any kind of conclusions about that. What I can tell you is that we definitely see some shifts to some of the direct channels at Autodesk for customers that were probably just served on a very kind of arm's length kind of transactional level. But in terms of driving cross-sell and upsell, early days, early days. But if you want to get a sense for how that might evolve, we've got experience with our EBAs and our enterprise business agreements. And we've learned over the years that having that kind of relationship with the customer where we really understand their usage patterns, who they are and what they're doing, we are much more effective at driving cross-sell and upsell even when partnering with our channel partners. So, I think those kind of stand as a testament of what's possible as we move forward with completion of the new transaction model. Adam Borg -- Analyst Great. And maybe just as a quick follow-up. Just as we think about the new administration coming in, you talked about the macro being broadly consistent. Any change in tone in your conversations with the end markets in terms of optimism or their ability or willingness to expand new projects ahead of the administration? Any pause or just full steam ahead? I'm just curious, any commentary you have there from a macro perspective would be really, really helpful. Thanks so much. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director What I'll say is the things that matter to our customers are bipartisan things, all right? Our customers care about infrastructure builds out. Both parties care about infrastructure build-outs. Our customers care about domestic manufacturing in Europe, be it in the United States, both parties agree that the domestic manufacturing build-outs are important. Supply chain, independent, supply chain stability. All of these things are bipartisan issues that really affect our customers. So, regardless of the administration, I suspect the things that are important to our customers are continuing to be a focus. Adam Borg -- Analyst Thanks, again. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink of Baird. Please go ahead, Joe. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst Thank you. On the outlook for next year, $2.050 billion in free cash has, I think, been the expectation for the past year now. Within the last year, you've also seen more co-term of contracts. And I think that leads to better billings in FY '26. So, my question is, does that actually create the potential that things are better, and that's why you're qualifying now the $2.050 billion as the midpoint of possibilities. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer There's no change to how we've talked about the free cash flow guide for fiscal '26, it continues to be $2.05 billion at the mid-point. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst OK. Fair enough. And then just on the M&A environment, over recent history, Autodesk has been more in a mode of, I would say, strategic tuck-ins. I think there is actually an asset in the CFD simulation space that was announced during AU in the quarter. Is that the right approach for Autodesk, just given this point in time, all the work you've done to build out the cloud platform, the data models, and so these tuck-ins make the most sense? And if that's true, how would you maybe compare and contrast some of the larger-scale M&A that's happening with your peers in the space? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, look, consolidation in our space is inevitable. I'm not going to comment on any specific deals, but here's what I'll say. Autodesk has always been an acquisitive company, and we will be an inquisitive company when that makes both strategic and financial sense for the company. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst OK. Thank you. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Joe. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Porter of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Elizabeth. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great, thanks so much for the question. As partners are getting customers just up and running on the new transaction model, we picked up that they're spending a little bit more time than usual of time and resources with those existing customers. So, I was curious if that had any impact on new business demand kind of more recently -- and then just more broadly, any change in new business trends that you think you should call out from versus last quarter? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Elizabeth, it's Betsy. And so, just broadly speaking, we continue to see growth, but at a slower pace due to a number of factors really over the last several years, macro, COVID, exiting Russia, elections, and while a drag on the forward momentum of the business, all of that really factored into our guidance. So, I kind of just will leave it at that. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great. And then a follow-up just on billings. I understand there's a lot of volatility around the change from multiyear in the transaction model. But it looks like guidance implies a bigger step down in growth in Q4, just despite easier year-ago compare. So, hoping that you could help us unpack the balance of those headwinds and tailwinds that would drive kind of a greater downtick in growth in Q4. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, again, let me start out with just from a fiscal '25 perspective. Your billing tailwinds are going to be from the final shift to annual billings, new transaction model and early renewals. And you're going to get headwinds from co-terming and business booked ahead of the new transaction model launch and in recent weeks, some FX. So, again, I think that we've continued to perform well as we've executed through through Q3. And so, I think we feel very, very strongly about our expectations for Q4. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bhavin Shah of Deutsche Bank. Your question please, Bhavin. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Great, thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the quarter. Andrew, at university, there appeared to be a noticeable uptick in attendance and sessions geared toward owners and operators. What been driving the recent interest from the segment? How much of it is product enhancements you guys have made versus really more focusing and emphasizing from a go-to-market perspective? And how long before this segment of buyers kind of becomes more meaningful to the financials? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah, Bhavin, that's an excellent question, right. We're very interested in tackling the whole entire life cycle from design, through make, construction, manufacturing, all the way into operations. You're probably aware we have a product called Tandem. And a lot of those sessions were driven by increasing interest and increasing adoption of Tandem, which is a digital twin solution, tightly coupled to our solutions that also has a toolkit that allows people to easily connect sensor data through the digital twin solution. So, you're seeing that uptick because we're directly releasing products and capabilities that are of interest to the owner space. You can expect to see that trend continue over time, and you can expect to see us continue to talk about the owner space, continue to deliver solutions for the owner space and even APIs for the owner space. It's an area of great interest, especially when it comes not only to vertical buildings, but factories and other things that are related to that as well as, infrastructure like what we were doing with some of our water owner solutions. So, yes, owners matter. We're building software for them, and you're going to see more of that. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Super helpful there. And then, Betsy, one for you. Just in terms of the underlying improvement that we've been seeing in the margins, and I know you've called out FX and the transaction model. I know it's very early, but as you think about next year, how do we think about like the impact of FX and the transaction model to kind of the headline operating margins? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, I wish I could give you that answer, but I think that the new CFO would probably have a little bit of a problem with that. So, we'll wait till the end of February to give you more specifics on that. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Fair enough. Thanks for taking may questions. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Good try. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke of Citi. Please go ahead, Tyler. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Yeah, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I was going to ask you about a placeholder for next year's guidance, Betsy. don't want to waste a question on that, but feel free to answer. But Andrew, I wanted to kind of ask you about some of your comments you made around efficiency, especially as it relates to hiring Janesh, who you pointed out has a lot of experience at larger companies, VMware, Cisco, et cetera. Now that you're a few quarters into this transaction model rollout, you have kind of visibility better on some of the channel prior channel relationships, having that direct billing with the customer. What are some of the areas that you've identified as having that efficiency potential? And then as we think about that efficiency unlock, should we think about that as incremental to the free cash flow number you have out for next year? Or is that embedded in that already. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director So, many layers to that question. All right. First, let me kind of answer the question in a series of stages then dodge other ones, OK? So, first off, optimization is kind of a mindset at Autodesk. It's not something that that suddenly happens. I want to reemphasize that because if you look right now, this year, for example, when you look at the apples-to-apples comparison, which will be in the slide decks, are in our disclosed materials you can see that our non-GAAP margins are already hitting the targets we set for next year this year, OK? So, optimization is a mentality. You've also heard me say over and over again as the new transaction model starts to roll out, optimization of our go-to-market efforts is going to be a critical step for us and part of the optimization journey that we're on, that's going to deliver margin growth for the company for couple of years to come, OK? And I think that's important. It's a long-term driver. Now with getting into the specifics, OK? I think the specifics are probably for another time, but let me just kind of give you a sense for some of the things that are important, right? One is the drive to self-service, right? Self-service is a huge impact on how our customers will engage with us and where those customers come from, and that is value accretive to Autodesk, both on an efficiency side, from renewals and other things, but also on the revenue growth side through capturing the customers directly. The other thing I talked about is understanding the customer better, so the upsell and cross-sell. So, we're going to be able to do a lot more automation and understanding about where the opportunities are, and that's going to drive some efficiencies. And we're moving the channel partners away from this model of being the transactional players to being the solution providers and the IP providers to our customers. That's going to have all sorts of opportunities to eliminate duplication of effort and drive real cost efficiencies for the company moving forward. There's both top-line efficiencies here in revenue growth, but there's bottom line efficiencies as well through removing the redundancies and steps that just aren't necessary for the customer. You'll get a lot more clarity on that as you see us continue to move forward with this go-to-market optimization in the next year and beyond that. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Great. And then my follow-up question, Andrew, you talked about some really strong net new customer additions within the Construction Cloud, I think, doubling year over year. we also saw the Make revenue accelerate to 28% constant currency. Can you just help us understand, do you think that reacceleration is durable? And how are you sort of thinking about just your position there? What's been driving that strength in the new customer additions? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director First, let me comment on the make revenues, then I'm going to go into construction. So, the make revenue also includes some revenue from PIX and things associated with that. However, let's talk about the facts around our construction business because I think this is important, right? No. 1 factor is that we continue to drive consistent, high growth in our construction solutions. You're seeing it. It's built into the Make numbers, and it's the lion's share of those Make numbers. You're really seeing some consistent growth there. That's organically. Inorganically, we're actually executing incredibly well on things like Payapps, and that's driving acceleration of our growth. So, we are not decelerating as a business, OK? We are actually performing solidly inorganically, we're accelerating, all right? And I just want to be really clear about that. And yes, we said year over year, we drove a 2x increase in our new customers. And I'll talk about where some of that's coming from in just a minute. But I also want to highlight the other thing that's going on we are strengthening an already strong position in the ENR 400. So, you heard about the story about power construction, which was a great example of someone taking out a competitive RFP and say, look, I need a forward-looking cloud-based solution on new technology that goes end to end from design to construction all the way to operations. And they chose us. And that was just one example that we gave in the opening commentary. So, already a strengthening position in the ENR 400. Now the other qualitative things that are driving some of that new customer growth is we already have our distribution channel operating at scale. In the U.S., this is helping us go down market more effectively, which is allowing us to capture more customers more effectively be places where we weren't before and where others aren't, which is part of driving that. But also, we're already at scale operating internationally with our distribution channel. So, that's driving international growth for us. And that's a really important driver as well as, some of those net new accounts that you're seeing there. And the last thing I'll add that I'm done with construction is that, look, I heard this over and over again at AU, I'm hearing it over and over again from customers in lots of different places. They want the end-to-end solution. They want the licensed version in the cloud, they're placing bets for the next 10 years. They want to go from design to construction to operations, and that's just making our solution more attractive to the market. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo. Your question, please. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Hey, thanks very much. I appreciate you taking the questions. A commentary on the call sounded consistent, but wondering if there are any added details you can provide for us on just the overall macro spend environment and how that's maybe progressing across either key product segments or geos, whatever split you think is more useful. I think what we're trying to get a sense for is if there are any shades of improvement anywhere or if you'd characterize as mainly just consistent over the past couple of quarters. Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Michael, I think the core answer here is consistency, OK? We're seeing consistent trends that we've seen with -- in all the other quarters. There's always puts and takes in a large business like ours, especially ones as divers as ours. But the general tone is consistent with prior quarters. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer And I would just add that there's also been a lot of noise this year from the new transaction model and then obviously, the elections and leading up to that. And so, it's hard to sparse out kind of that particular behavior. So, I think as Andrew said, we call it consistent. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Yeah, tough for us, too. That's why we keep asking. Betsy, congrats on the transition back given you're also on the board. I think it'd be useful to hear you chime in on the hiring of Janesh and maybe just also comment on how you ensure you're able to hand over the reins and keep progress going on the key transitions the company is working through. Thanks. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Per se, I was involved in the process, which was quite extensive in the company and the recruiting of Janesh. And so, we're certainly very excited to have him on board. What I would also say is, obviously, with my experience of being on the board for 11 years as well as, my deep dive into the business over the last six months. One of the reasons I'm staying around until the end of the fiscal year, is I think I could be really helpful in that transition for Janesh. And so, I'm very much looking forward to it. And I think that we have a great finance team, and I think that he's going to fit very well, and I'm looking forward to making that happen as fast as we can. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. Your question, please, Matthew. Mike Richards -- Analyst Hey, guys. This is Mike Richards on for Matt. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could provide an update on Project Bernini and maybe how customer reception has been and where we are in developing other foundational models or just the monetization opportunity there? Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, first off, before I comment on Bernini, as you might have heard from AU, AI is embedded in everything we're doing from a bottom-up and a top-down perspective. And you also heard us talk at AU about new types of foundation models we're building that understand how certain things are done in our applications. You heard about a foundation model that's driving automated drawing creation. You heard about a foundation model that's driving automated sketch generation and sketch constraints. That kind of stuff is bottom-up innovation. Bernini more of a top-down type innovation where you're actually specifying things and trying to generate a preliminary outcome from those specifications. And what we've been doing with Bernini is we've been trying to engage with certain targeted customers to get them to participate with us in making Bernini smarter and more intelligent. It's not available commercially right now. but it's getting more intelligent. We've actually been successful in getting some customers to stand up and say, look, yes, I'd like to work with you to make this more intelligent because we need something that actually understands 3D geometry as geometry, not just in the picture or something, OK? So, that's what's going on with Bernini right now, and you should continue to see refinements and extensions of that moving forward. Now with regard to monetization, monetization, nobody knows exactly how all this is going to be monetized. But there's a few vectors here that that come into play. One, we are ahead of our competitors in this space. We intend to be ahead. We're investing to stay ahead. That increase ones competitive position in the marketplace, and that's really important. Also, you get to be able to charge for some of these incremental features in the future. When you're delivering value or a high-quality outcome as a result, you're going to charge for that outcome. How we charge for those things? Let's just play out, OK? It's still early days. But there's also monetization opportunities through licensing certain technologies for specific mature maturation for specific customers' needs, all right? And that will be another avenue. So, how these avenues play out, which one waits more, let this play out. But what you need to know about Autodesk is we're ahead. We've been ahead for a while. We were the first out there with an AI research lab that been out there for over six years. It's published 70 papers. We're right on the cutting edge of 3D design technology in AI, and we intend to stay there. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of J.P. Morgan. Your question please, Steve. Stephen Tusa -- Analyst Good evening or afternoon. Lots of good questions asked. Just a detailed one. What's the change in the billings contribution from the transaction model change? The five to six to five to five and a half. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Yeah. So, it's basically because we did more buy/sell business ahead of the European launch. It's short answer. So, remember, we said 5% to 6% when we launched Europe. And it was the -- we did more buy sell business, which means there's less tailwind from the new transaction model. The flip side of -- that means that the underlying increase in our billings guidance is greater than it looks on a headline basis. Stephen Tusa -- Analyst OK, great. Thanks a lot. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Tilton of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Hey, guys, can you hear me? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Great. I have a kind of a high-level one on the incoming CFO. If I heard correctly, we didn't exactly get like an initial outlook for revenue growth for next year. And I'm just trying to understand in the context of the new CFO coming in, is there anything that could change the calculus of how you guys think about that 10% to 15% growth for the underlying business outside of the agency transition that's ongoing today. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Well, first, let's talk about that framework a little bit, and then I'll comment a little bit on the incoming CFO. So, look, the 10% to 15% growth. Right now, we're pretty much right at the bottom end of that range. And if we look back over the last two years, there's been a series of things that created headwinds to new business. It started off with things like the pandemic, the inflation, the exiting of the Russian business, the writer's strike, the whole trade wars within particular geographies. All of these things were accumulated headwinds that build slowly into the business and have pushed us down to the low end of the range. it takes time in a subscription model for those things to build out of the business, OK? So, it's going to take time for us to build out of that. That's to be expected with a subscription model. The revenue goes down slowly. It goes back up slowly as headwinds turn into tailwinds. So, expect us to be near the bottom of that range in the short term just as a general kind of guideline for the core business to be at the bottom of the range, OK? As a long-term framework, the 10% to 15% still makes sense as a long-term guide for the company. But of course, as new eyes come in, we'll look at these things, and we'll evaluate them. But right now, this all still makes sense. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Super helpful. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho. Your question, please. Siti Panigrahi -- Analyst Thanks for taking my question. I understand the new business model of some kind of noise in your expense and margin side. But if you exclude that, where do you see some of the operating leverage that you can drive in next year or so? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, I think we've actually provided kind of historically what we've done over the last three years pretty clearly. And I think we said that we continue to be focused on expansion, but nothing further to add as far as next year. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director We did provide data on that. So, you can see what underlying thing is, and we expect to see continued improvement in that same vector. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations On the same basis. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director On the same basis, on the same apples-to-apples basis. Siti Panigrahi -- Analyst OK, great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Funk of Bank of America. Your question, please. Michael Funk -- Analyst Yeah. Guys, thank you for the question tonight. Two, if I could. You've mentioned a few times in the last calls about the largest multiyear cohort renewing next year and then also a large EBA cohort. Just wondering if you can give us kind of the range of potential outcomes among the renewals there, whether a potential to upsell, risk of down sell and what that variance might look like around those renewals? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer No. I mean I think what we have said is that it's the largest cohort and we saw that performance in '23. And so, we expect a strong renewal year, but we're not giving any specific guidance on what that looks like for '26 at this point, and we'll wait until we report earnings in February. Michael Funk -- Analyst OK. Great. And then, Betsy, one more. You've mentioned a few times after the investment in new transaction model, people processes, and automation, presumably more fixed cost versus variable like commission. Can you quantify that for us to help us with modeling as we try to forecast margin? I know you've not given guidance, but better understanding of what that cost might actually be on an absolute basis would help us to think about our modeling. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Mike, we've got a slide in the earnings deck to help you think about modeling. And I'll just point you to that. Michael Funk -- Analyst OK, great. Thank you, Simon. Operator Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for Q&A today. I would now like to turn the conference back to Simon Mays-Smith for closing remarks. Sir? Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Great.

that's true, would maybe compare contrast larger-scale m&a that's happening peer space? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah. so, look, consolidation space inevitable. going comment specific deals, here's say. autodesk always acquisitive company, inquisitive company make strategic financial sense company. joe vruwink -- analyst ok. thank you. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director thank you, joe. operator thank you. next question come line elizabeth porter morgan stanley. please go ahead, elizabeth. elizabeth porter -- analyst great, thanks much question. partner getting customer running new transaction model, picked spending little bit time usual time resource existing customers. so, curious impact new business demand kind recently -- broadly, change new business trend think call versus last quarter? betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer yeah. elizabeth, betsy. so, broadly speaking, continue see growth, slower pace due number factor really last several years, macro, covid, exiting russia, elections, drag forward momentum business, really factored guidance. so, kind leave that. elizabeth porter -- analyst great. follow-up billings. understand there's lot volatility around change multiyear transaction model. look like guidance implies bigger step growth q4, despite easier year-ago compare. so, hoping could help u unpack balance headwind tailwind would drive kind greater downtick growth q4. betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer well, again, let start fiscal '25 perspective. billing tailwind going final shift annual billings, new transaction model early renewals. going get headwind co-terming business booked ahead new transaction model launch recent weeks, fx. so, again, think continued perform well executed q3. so, think feel very, strongly expectation q4. elizabeth porter -- analyst great. thank you. operator thank you. next question come line bhavin shah deutsche bank. question please, bhavin. bhavin shah -- analyst great, thanks taking question, congrats quarter. andrew, university, appeared noticeable uptick attendance session geared toward owner operators. driving recent interest segment?

betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer well, wish could give answer, think new cfo would probably little bit problem that. so, wait till end february give specific that. bhavin shah -- analyst fair enough. thanks taking may questions. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director good try. operator thank you. next question come line tyler radke citi. please go ahead, tyler. tyler radke -- analyst yeah, good afternoon. thanks taking questions. going ask placeholder next year's guidance, betsy. want waste question that, feel free answer. andrew, wanted kind ask comment made around efficiency, especially relates hiring janesh, pointed lot experience larger companies, vmware, cisco, et cetera. quarter transaction model rollout, kind visibility better channel prior channel relationships, direct billing customer. area identified efficiency potential? think efficiency unlock, think incremental free cash flow number next year? embedded already. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director so, many layer question. right. first, let kind answer question series stage dodge ones, ok? so, first off, optimization kind mindset autodesk. something suddenly happens. want reemphasize look right now, year, example, look apples-to-apples comparison, slide decks, disclosed material see non-gaap margin already hitting target set next year year, ok? so, optimization mentality. also heard say new transaction model start roll out, optimization go-to-market effort going critical step u part optimization journey on, that's going deliver margin growth company couple year come, ok? think that's important. long-term driver. getting specifics, ok? think specific probably another time, let kind give sense thing important, right? one drive self-service, right? self-service huge impact customer engage u customer come from, value accretive autodesk, efficiency side, renewal things, also revenue growth side capturing customer directly. thing talked understanding customer better, upsell cross-sell. so, going able lot automation understanding opportunity are, that's going drive efficiencies. moving channel partner away model transactional player solution provider ip provider customers. that's going sort opportunity eliminate duplication effort drive real cost efficiency company moving forward. there's top-line efficiency revenue growth, there's bottom line efficiency well removing redundancy step necessary customer. get lot clarity see u continue move forward go-to-market optimization next year beyond that. tyler radke -- analyst great. follow-up question, andrew, talked really strong net new customer addition within construction cloud, think, doubling year year. also saw make revenue accelerate 28% constant currency. help u understand, think reacceleration durable? sort thinking position there? what's driving strength new customer additions? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director first, let comment make revenues, going go construction. so, make revenue also includes revenue pix thing associated that. however, let's talk fact around construction business think important, right? no. 1 factor continue drive consistent, high growth construction solutions. seeing it. built make numbers, lion's share make numbers. really seeing consistent growth there. that's organically. inorganically, actually executing incredibly well thing like payapps, that's driving acceleration growth. so, decelerating business, ok? actually performing solidly inorganically, accelerating, right? want really clear that. yes, said year year, drove 2x increase new customers. talk that's coming minute. also want highlight thing that's going strengthening already strong position enr 400. so, heard story power construction, great example someone taking competitive rfp say, look, need forward-looking cloud-based solution new technology go end end design construction way operations. chose us. one example gave opening commentary. so, already strengthening position enr 400. qualitative thing driving new customer growth already distribution channel operating scale. u.s., helping u go market effectively, allowing u capture customer effectively place others aren't, part driving that. also, already scale operating internationally distribution channel. so, that's driving international growth us. that's really important driver well as, net new account seeing there. last thing add done construction that, look, heard au, hearing customer lot different places. want end-to-end solution. want licensed version cloud, placing bet next 10 years. want go design construction operations, that's making solution attractive market. operator thank you. next question come line michael turrin well fargo. question, please. michael turrin -- analyst hey, thanks much. appreciate taking questions. commentary call sounded consistent, wondering added detail provide u overall macro spend environment that's maybe progressing across either key product segment geos, whatever split think useful. think trying get sense shade improvement anywhere characterize mainly consistent past couple quarters. thanks. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director michael, think core answer consistency, ok? seeing consistent trend seen -- quarters. there's always put take large business like ours, especially one diver ours. general tone consistent prior quarters. betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer would add there's also lot noise year new transaction model obviously, election leading that. so, hard sparse kind particular behavior. so, think andrew said, call consistent. michael turrin -- analyst yeah, tough us, too. that's keep asking. betsy, congrats transition back given also board. think useful hear chime hiring janesh maybe also comment ensure able hand rein keep progress going key transition company working through. thanks. betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer per se, involved process, quite extensive company recruiting janesh. so, certainly excited board. would also say is, obviously, experience board 11 year well as, deep dive business last six months. one reason staying around end fiscal year, think could really helpful transition janesh. so, much looking forward it. think great finance team, think going fit well, looking forward making happen fast can. michael turrin -- analyst thank you. operator thank you. next question come line matthew hedberg rbc capital markets. question, please, matthew. mike richards -- analyst hey, guys. mike richards matt. thanks taking question. wondering could provide update project bernini maybe customer reception developing foundational model monetization opportunity there? thanks. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah. so, first off, comment bernini, might heard au, ai embedded everything bottom-up top-down perspective. also heard u talk au new type foundation model building understand certain thing done applications. heard foundation model that's driving automated drawing creation. heard foundation model that's driving automated sketch generation sketch constraints. kind stuff bottom-up innovation. bernini top-down type innovation actually specifying thing trying generate preliminary outcome specifications. bernini trying engage certain targeted customer get participate u making bernini smarter intelligent. available commercially right now. getting intelligent. actually successful getting customer stand say, look, yes, like work make intelligent need something actually understands 3d geometry geometry, picture something, ok? so, that's what's going bernini right now, continue see refinement extension moving forward. regard monetization, monetization, nobody know exactly going monetized. there's vector come play. one, ahead competitor space. intend ahead. investing stay ahead. increase one competitive position marketplace, that's really important. also, get able charge incremental feature future. delivering value high-quality outcome result, going charge outcome. charge things? let's play out, ok? still early days. there's also monetization opportunity licensing certain technology specific mature maturation specific customers' needs, right? another avenue. so, avenue play out, one wait more, let play out. need know autodesk ahead. ahead while. first ai research lab six years. published 70 papers. right cutting edge 3d design technology ai, intend stay there. operator thank you. next question come line steve tusa j.p. morgan. question please, steve. stephen tusa -- analyst good evening afternoon. lot good question asked. detailed one. what's change billing contribution transaction model change? five six five five half. simon mays-smith -- vice president, investor relation yeah. so, basically buy/sell business ahead european launch. short answer. so, remember, said 5% 6% launched europe. -- buy sell business, mean there's less tailwind new transaction model. flip side -- mean underlying increase billing guidance greater look headline basis. stephen tusa -- analyst ok, great. thanks lot. operator thank you. next question come line joshua tilton wolfe research. line open. joshua tilton -- analyst hey, guys, hear me?

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Simon Mays-Smith, VP, investor relations. Please go ahead. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Thanks, operator, and good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the third quarter results of Autodesk's fiscal '25. On the line with me is Andrew Anagnost, our CEO; and Betsy Rafael, our interim CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including outlook and related assumptions and on product and strategies. Actual events or results could differ materially. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-Q and the Form 8-K filed with today's press release for important risks and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today. If this call is replayed or reviewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Autodesk disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will quote several numeric or growth changes during this call as we discuss our financial performance. Unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison. All non-GAAP numbers referenced in today's call are reconciled in our press release or Excel financials and other supplemental materials available on our Investor Relations website. And now, I will turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Simon, and welcome, everyone, to the call. We finished the third quarter of the year strongly, delivering 12% revenue growth in constant currency and have again raised full year guidance. This reflects the sustained momentum of the business and successful execution of our strategy, including a smooth implementation of the new transaction model in Western Europe. Once again, opportunity, resilience and discipline underpinned our performance. Last month at Autodesk University in San Diego, we hosted 12,000 registered attendees and another 30,000 online. We showed how granular data in the cloud, organized the data models and connected to everything through APIs to deliver even more valuable and connected solutions for customers and partners and support a much broader ecosystem and marketplace. Customers and channel partners that I spoke with at AU remain cautiously optimistic, a sentiment consistent with the underlying momentum of our business, our growing product usage and BuildingConnected bid activity trends over recent quarters. I left AU with a tremendous sense of purpose and optimism in the ingenuity and persistence of our customers and for the future. On our earnings call last quarter, I set out our secular growth opportunities and our strategy to capitalize on them. I concluded that Autodesk's investment in cloud, platform and AI in pursuit of those opportunities were ahead of its peers. AU was a good demonstration of that. But we're also leading the industry in modernizing our go-to-market motion starting a few years ago with the subscription transition through consumption and self-service enablement and more recently to direct billing. These initiatives enable Autodesk to build larger and more durable direct relationships with its customers and to serve them more efficiently. We have already seen significant benefits from initiatives like these, and there's more to come in the next optimization phase. Taking out the effects on margins from FX and the new transaction model, we still expect to be toward the midpoint of our fiscal '26 non-GAAP operating margin target of 38% to 40% in fiscal '25, a year ahead of schedule. We're confident we will make further improvement in fiscal '26 on the same basis. The new transaction model will enable tighter channel partnerships with less duplication of effort and more digital self-service and automation, which increases customer satisfaction and workforce productivity. It will also create new opportunities for partners Autodesk to earn more with less emphasis on transaction revenue sharing and a greater emphasis on value creation for customers. Once complete, we expect the new transaction model and subsequent go-to-market optimization to increase sales and marketing efficiency and deliver GAAP margins among the best in the industry. Attractive, long-term, secular growth markets, a focused strategy delivering ever more valuable and connected solutions to our customers, and a resilient business are generating strong and sustained momentum, both in absolute terms and relative to peers. Disciplined execution and capital deployment has driven even greater operational velocity and efficiency within Autodesk and will underpin the mechanical build of revenue and free cash flow over the next few years and GAAP margins among the best in the industry. We will continue to deploy capital to offset and buy forward dilution as our free cash flow grows from the fiscal '24 trough. This practice has reduced our share count over the last three years. We have significantly increased our share repurchase authorization to extend this momentum flexibility over the medium term, with the precise trajectory remaining dependent on our debt repayment schedule and the ebb and flow of M&A. In combination, we believe these factors will deliver sustainable shareholder value over many years. Before I conclude, I'd like to formally welcome Janesh to Autodesk. We're excited to welcome Janesh, who brings a wealth of experience and will be instrumental in sustaining Autodesk's growth and enhanced profitability momentum. Of equal importance, I'd like to thank Betsy for stepping in as interim CFO at an important time in the company's journey, and I'm looking forward to continuing to work closely with her as an Autodesk Board member. I will now turn the call over to Betsy to discuss our quarterly financial performance and guidance for the year. I'll then return to provide an update on our strategic growth initiatives. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Andrew. Q3 was another strong quarter. We generated broad-based underlying growth across products and regions. In addition, we saw revenue increases from the new transaction model and M&A which were offset by the absence of enterprise business agreement true-ups from Q3 last year and FX. Our Make products continued to enhance growth, driven by our ongoing strength in construction and Fusion. Overall, macroeconomic policy and geopolitical challenges and the underlying momentum of the business were consistent with the last few quarters, with continued strong renewal rates and headwinds to our new business growth. Total revenue grew 11% and 12% in constant currency. By product, in constant currency, AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT revenue grew 8%. AEC revenue, which was most impacted by the absence of true-up revenues, grew 12%, Manufacturing revenue grew 16% and still comfortably in double digits, excluding upfront revenue. And M&E revenue grew 15% boosted by the PIX acquisition and associated integration adjustments. By region, in constant currency, revenue grew 11% in the Americas which was most impacted by the absence of true-up revenues, 13% in EMEA and 14% in APAC. The mechanical contribution from the new transaction model to revenue was $17 million in the third quarter and $25 million on a year-to-date basis. Direct revenue increased 23% and represented 42% of total revenue, up 4 percentage points from last year, benefiting from strong growth in both EBAs and the Autodesk store and also the natural tailwind to revenue from the new transaction model. Net revenue retention rate remained within the 100% to 110% range at constant exchange rates. Billings increased 28% in the quarter, reflecting a tailwind from the prior-year shift to annual billings for most multiyear contracts, early renewals and the natural tailwind from the transition to the new transaction model. Similar to last quarter, and as expected, co-terming negatively impacted billing ahead of the launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe. The natural contribution from the new transaction model to billing was $72 million in the third quarter and $108 million on a year-to-date basis. Total deferred revenue decreased 9% to $3.7 billion and was again impacted by the transition from upfront to annual billings for multiyear contracts. Total RPO of $6.1 billion and current RPO of $4.0 billion grew 17% and 14%, respectively, which reflects a tailwind from early renewals and the new transaction model and a headwind from the declining contribution of billed and unbilled deferred revenue from large, multiyear and EBA cohorts ahead of renewal in fiscal '26. Excluding these, current RPO growth was broadly consistent with Q2. We do expect the new transaction model and the larger FY '26 renewal cohorts to have a greater impact on both RPO and current RPO growth in Q4 of fiscal '25. Turning to margins. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were broadly low. With Autodesk University shifting back to Q3 this year from Q4 last year, GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins decreased by 2 and 3 percentage points, respectively. The timing effect from AU obviously washes out over the full year. At current course and speed, the ratio of stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue peaked in fiscal '24, will follow by more than a percentage point in fiscal '25 and will be below 10% over time. Free cash flow for the quarter was $199 million. This benefited from some channel partners in Western Europe booking business earlier in the quarter ahead of the transition to the new transaction model really to derisk month one after the transition. This accelerated free cash flow to the third quarter, which was partially offset by the expected negative impact of co-terming in Western Europe. Turning now to capital allocation. We continue to actively manage capital within our framework and deploy it with discipline and focus through the economic cycle to drive long-term shareholder value. As expected, the pace of buybacks picked up in the third quarter. We purchased approximately 1.2 million shares for $319 million at an average price of approximately $269 per share. We will continue to deploy capital to offset and buy forward dilution as our free cash flow grows from the fiscal '24 trough. This practice has reduced our share count by about 5 million shares over the last three years with an average percentage reduction of about 70 basis points per year. We increased the amount authorized under our share repurchase program by $5 billion for a total of approximately $9 billion. This expands our flexibility over the medium term with the precise trajectory remaining dependent on our debt repayment schedule as well as, the ebbs and flow of M&A. Now let me finish with guidance. As we said in the February, the pace of the rollout of the new transaction model will create noise in billings and the P&L. So, we think free cash flow is the best measure of our performance. Taking out that noise, the underlying momentum in the business remains consistent with the expectations embedded in our guidance range for the full year with continued strong renewal rates and headwinds to new business growth. Our sustained momentum in the third quarter and smooth launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe, reduced the likelihood of our more cautious forecast scenario. Given that, we're raising the midpoint of our billing, revenue, margin, earnings per share and free cash flow guidance ranges. So, let me give you a little bit more detail. The underlying momentum of billing is in line with our expectations. Compared to our modeling at the start of the year, the launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe in Q3 and early renewals have been a tailwind for billings, whereas more co-terming, more business done under the old buy-sell model before the launch of the new transaction model and in recent weeks, FX movement have been headwinds for billing. We now estimate that the new transaction model will provide between a 5 and 5.5 percentage point tailwind to billings growth in fiscal '25. We've raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 billings guidance by $10 million to a range of $5.90 billion to $5.98 billion. The underlying momentum of revenue is also in line with our expectations. We estimate the new transaction model will provide around 1 to 1.5 percentage point tailwind to revenue growth in fiscal '25. Upfront revenue contributed 2 percentage points to revenue growth in Q4 of fiscal '24, and therefore, this is a headwind in Q4 of fiscal '25. While not large enough to call out at the start of the year, it was already factored into our Q4 and our full year model. We've raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 revenue guidance range by $18 million to a range of $6.12 billion to $6.13 billion. We're increasing our GAAP and non-GAAP margin guidance midpoint by 25 basis points by raising the bottom end of the ranges by 50 basis points. The GAAP margin guidance range is now 21.5% to 22%. The non-GAAP margin guidance range is now 35.5% to 36%, which includes a 1 to 1.5 percentage point underlying margin improvement, broadly offset by the margin headwinds from the new transaction model and the related incremental investments in people, processes and automation. The underlying momentum of free cash flow is also in line with our expectations. The headwind to billings from co-terming and FX rates that I mentioned earlier, is being offset by early renewals, faster collections and improved underlying margins. We raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 free cash flow guidance by $10 million and tightened the range to $1.47 billion to $1.5 billion. We expect strong free cash flow growth in fiscal '26 because of the return of our largest multiyear renewal cohort the natural mechanical stacking of multiyear contracts billed annually and a larger EBA cohort. With our current trajectory, we still estimate free cash flow in fiscal '26 to be around $2.05 billion at the midpoint. The slide deck on our website has more details on modeling assumptions for Q3 and for the full fiscal year '25. And while this may be my last earnings call for Autodesk, I will stick around for a bit to ensure a smooth transition to Janesh. Thank you, Andrew, and everyone at Autodesk for your support while I was here and to the many investors and the analysts with whom I've had lively discussions over the last few quarters. While the transition to annual billings for multiyear contracts and the deployment of the new transaction model has created noise and billings in the P&L, they do provide a natural near-term tailwind to revenue and free cash flow growth. Combined with a resilient business model, sustained competitive momentum, Autodesk has enviable sources of visibility and certainty to very uncertain world. For all these reasons, I stepped down from my role as interim CFO with tremendous optimism for the future. Andrew, back to you. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Betsy. Let me finish by updating you on our strong progress in the third quarter. We continue to see good momentum in AEC, particularly in infrastructure and construction, fueled by customers consolidating onto our solutions to connect and optimize previously siloed workflows through the cloud. The cornerstone of that growing interest is our comprehensive end-to-end solutions in completing designs, preconstruction, field execution through handover and into operations. This breadth of connected capability enables us to extend our footprint further into infrastructure and construction and also expand our reach into the mid-market. As a sign of our growing momentum as the benefits of our end-to-end solution become more apparent, our construction business continue to perform robustly with net new customers doubling year over year and existing customers' renewal and expansion rates remaining strong. Let me give you a few examples. Power Construction is No. 79 on the Engineering News Record, ENR Top 400 U.S. contractor list. It is a Chicago-based general contractor serving residential and nonresidential end markets. After completing a competitive RFP to replace its legacy project management tool, Power selected Autodesk for its unified construction platform across preconstruction, construction, and DDC. By standardizing on Autodesk Construction Cloud, Power will have a single source of truth for project data, enhanced collaboration capabilities, and streamlined workflows on a single platform. Power Construction was one of two ENR 400 top 100 U.S. contractors that standardized enterprisewide on Autodesk build during the quarter. In Europe, Bouygues, a top 10 ENR 250 international contractor based in France and a leader in sustainable building and infrastructure projects renewed and expanded its EBA in the quarter. Bouygues is continuing to consolidate on Autodesk solutions across the enterprise, including broader adoption of Autodesk Forma, Carbon Insight, and Informed Design to digitize, decarbonize, and industrialize projects. It also significantly increased its commitment to Autodesk Construction Cloud to drive efficiency gains and faster bid response times through better collaboration between design and project teams. Surbana Jurong is No. 23 on ENR's top 225 international design firms. Based in Singapore, it is an urban infrastructure and integrated solutions consulting firm. In Q3, it renewed its third EBA, which included increased investment in Autodesk Construction Cloud and Autodesk Water infrastructure solutions. ACC is helping to scale its operations through increased automation, integrated design workflows and enhanced collaboration across time zones. Our water infrastructure solutions will be a core technology supporting its growth ambitions in planning, designing, engineering and managing water projects for customers worldwide. Again, these stories have a common theme. Managing people, processes and data across the project life cycle to increase efficiency and sustainability while decreasing risk. Over time, we expect the majority of all projects to be managed this way, and we remain focused on enabling that transition through our industry cloud. Moving on to manufacturing. We made excellent progress on our strategic initiatives. Customers continue to invest in their digital transformation and consolidate our Design and Make platform. Fusion remains one of the fastest-growing products in the manufacturing industry. As customers seek to drive innovation and growth at lower cost, Fusion extension attach rates are increasing, which is helping to drive the average sales price higher. For example, in the quarter, a global manufacturer supplying the semiconductor industry selected Fusion Manage and Vault PLM over competitive solutions to foster greater collaboration across manufacturing sites and improve operating efficiency. Once fully scaled and operational, this customer expects to save 105,000 hours per year by connecting people and data, resulting in reduced product development costs and faster time to market. In the U.K., Playdale Playground has been designing, manufacturing, and installing outdoor playground equipment for over 40 years. This quarter, Playdale added Fusion to its existing portfolio of Autodesk solutions, including Inventor, AutoCAD, and Vault to streamline and digitize workflows, optimize production to reduce lead times, reduce nonconformities, and replace inefficient Excel-driven operations on the shop floor. A long time Autodesk customer and global leader in precision engineering solutions renewed and expanded its EBA in the quarter. In addition to Inventor, vault and AutoCAD, it is adopting Fusion's generative design capabilities for material waste reduction and fluid flow optimization and Moldflow to reduce manufacturing costs and defects while increasing mold yields. In education, universities continue to modernize their courses and curriculum to attract and prepare future engineers. For example, from this winter, students at the University of Stuttgart, Institute for Medical Device Technology will use Fusion across six courses. Fusion was selected to replace a competitive solution for its modern platform, ease of use, cloud collaboration capabilities and unique combination of PCB and additive manufacturing workflows in a single team environment. And lastly, we continue to work with our customers to ensure they are using the latest and most secure versions of our software. For example, after a period of rapid scaling and diversification, a large multinational manufacturing company in APAC was looking to align compliance rates across its global employee base. Working collaboratively we address compliance issues while cementing a long-term partnership and completing one of our largest ever license compliance agreements, which included expanded adoption of Alias and VRED for the Design Studio and PDMC for mechanical engineering and rail design. Attractive long-term secular growth markets, a focused strategy delivering ever more valuable and connected solutions to our customers and a resilient business are generating strong and sustained momentum both in absolute terms and relative to peers. Disciplined execution and capital deployment is driving an even greater operational velocity and efficiency within Autodesk, and we continue to deploy capital to deliver sustainable shareholder value over many years. I retain a tremendous sense of purpose and optimism in the ingenuity and persistence of our customers and for the future. Operator, we would now like to open the call up for questions. Questions & Answers: Operator Thank you. [Operator instructions] Again, please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Jason Celino of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your question, please. Jason Celino -- Analyst Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Just two for me. The first one, Andrew. Some of us are unfamiliar with Janesh. Can you just tell us a little bit more about him and what he brings to Autodesk? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director I certainly can. Before I do that, let me make sure that I thank Betsy for everything she brought to Autodesk during this interim period. I really appreciate it. The company appreciates it. Thank you, Betsy. Now we're really excited about Janesh. Let me tell you why we're excited about Janesh. As you remember, one of the things I was telling you that I was looking for was someone that was going to be able to dispassionately drive optimization at scale inside of Autodesk. And what that really means is someone that's going to be really inwardly focused, looking at every dollar that we invest and making sure that we're getting the most return for the business that investors are getting the best return from their business. The next kind of criteria we were looking for, which was nice to have was, time in the seat as a sitting CFO, which was important for us as well. But it was kind of the next nice to have after the optimization at scale. Janesh brings a great balance of both of those things, right? He's been in the seat seven years at Elastic, both CFO and COO, driving some fairly turbulent changes inside of Elastic. So, he's got battle stars from pushing inside the company to get changes done inside, and we like that. We like that a lot. He's also got very good early experience at companies that we feel have always added value to Autodesk. So, he was it VMware in a senior position. He was at Cisco in a senior position. We've had good success bringing people from those kind of companies. He worked at those companies driving optimization at scale, which is the No. 1 criteria I was looking for when we we're driving this work. He also has another nice to have. He's got knowledge of our industry. He spent two years at PTC in his career. He was actually recently on the PTC board. So, he understands our industry, and he'll be able to get up to speed pretty quickly. The No. 1 goal here drive optimization and scale over the next few years, make sure that we're getting everything we need from every dollar we invest, which is a very important theme for Autodesk. And with that, I'm really excited, and I'm looking forward to him joining in December. Jason Celino -- Analyst OK. Great. Interesting. And then for my second question, now that you do have a CFO, do you have any thoughts on when you might hold the next Investor Day? I think in the past, you usually did it in March. Is that a good time frame? Or is that too soon? Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. Well, Janesh is joining in December. I think we need to give him time to get his sea legs on giving time to kind of drive the end of the year and actually get us set up for next fiscal year in good stead. So, I would say it's unlikely we'll be doing anything in the spring, but we'll get back to you on that as soon as Janesh is ready to talk about those things. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Your question, please. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst Thank you. Andrew, as of the third quarter, your three-year CAGR for current RPO is about 12%. How are you thinking about the sustainability or perhaps improvement upon that CAGR or CRPO over the next number of years? When we think about the ingredients of that, it looks like over the last several years, the CAGR for your unit volume for all brands is roughly 6% to 7% in the aggregate. So, on top of that, you've had price and other ingredients, but perhaps talk about how you think you might be able to improve upon the most recent trajectory for current RPO. Then my follow-up. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Hi, Jay, this is Betsy. Let me just give you a couple of things. There's a number of things that are going on, on the headline of the CRPO number. If you first take away the headwinds and the tailwinds was broadly consistent with the second quarter. And as I mentioned in my opening commentary, early renewals and growth with -- and the new transaction model are providing a tailwind. And then there's also a headwind to CRPO growth from the declining contribution of billed and unbilled deferred revenue risk from the large multiyear EBA cohorts coming up for renewal in fiscal '26. And just as a reminder, these are the same larger cohorts we are calling out as the tailwinds to free cash flow for next year. And if you look back to fiscal '22, we saw the same dynamic ahead of the fiscal '23 renewals as well. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst OK. Since new management is part of the news this evening, could you talk about how you're thinking about the chief revenue officer position. Would it make sense perhaps to continue to have a separate CRO? Or do you think it might make more sense perhaps to combine CRO and COO? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, we're going to continue to have a separate CRO because we have various functions that work together there under the COO organization, including our IT organization, our infrastructure and all things associated. What we're looking for in our CRO is someone that understands how to continue to drive a business when you have direct engagement with the customer. So, that means someone that really understands what it takes to analyze self-service patterns, actually understand the data that comes in from the customers to help drive cross-sell and upsell while also transforming a channel from a transactionally focused extension of Autodesk to kind of a solution partner that's driving life cycle solutions for our customers. So, that's the kind of role we're looking for here. And yes, it's going to continue to be a stand-alone CRO role within the COO organization. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Borg of Stifel. Your line is open. Adam Borg -- Analyst Awesome. Thanks so much for taking the questions, and congrats to Betsy and Janesh. Maybe on the new transaction model. I know it's still early. But I was just curious, are there any learnings from those customers that are on the new model that you're seeing in terms of the adoption of Autodesk technology and the ability to find white space to better upsell and cross-sell different solutions now that you have a more direct relationship. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah, Adam, it's really early on to be able to make any kind of conclusions about that. What I can tell you is that we definitely see some shifts to some of the direct channels at Autodesk for customers that were probably just served on a very kind of arm's length kind of transactional level. But in terms of driving cross-sell and upsell, early days, early days. But if you want to get a sense for how that might evolve, we've got experience with our EBAs and our enterprise business agreements. And we've learned over the years that having that kind of relationship with the customer where we really understand their usage patterns, who they are and what they're doing, we are much more effective at driving cross-sell and upsell even when partnering with our channel partners. So, I think those kind of stand as a testament of what's possible as we move forward with completion of the new transaction model. Adam Borg -- Analyst Great. And maybe just as a quick follow-up. Just as we think about the new administration coming in, you talked about the macro being broadly consistent. Any change in tone in your conversations with the end markets in terms of optimism or their ability or willingness to expand new projects ahead of the administration? Any pause or just full steam ahead? I'm just curious, any commentary you have there from a macro perspective would be really, really helpful. Thanks so much. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director What I'll say is the things that matter to our customers are bipartisan things, all right? Our customers care about infrastructure builds out. Both parties care about infrastructure build-outs. Our customers care about domestic manufacturing in Europe, be it in the United States, both parties agree that the domestic manufacturing build-outs are important. Supply chain, independent, supply chain stability. All of these things are bipartisan issues that really affect our customers. So, regardless of the administration, I suspect the things that are important to our customers are continuing to be a focus. Adam Borg -- Analyst Thanks, again. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink of Baird. Please go ahead, Joe. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst Thank you. On the outlook for next year, $2.050 billion in free cash has, I think, been the expectation for the past year now. Within the last year, you've also seen more co-term of contracts. And I think that leads to better billings in FY '26. So, my question is, does that actually create the potential that things are better, and that's why you're qualifying now the $2.050 billion as the midpoint of possibilities. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer There's no change to how we've talked about the free cash flow guide for fiscal '26, it continues to be $2.05 billion at the mid-point. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst OK. Fair enough. And then just on the M&A environment, over recent history, Autodesk has been more in a mode of, I would say, strategic tuck-ins. I think there is actually an asset in the CFD simulation space that was announced during AU in the quarter. Is that the right approach for Autodesk, just given this point in time, all the work you've done to build out the cloud platform, the data models, and so these tuck-ins make the most sense? And if that's true, how would you maybe compare and contrast some of the larger-scale M&A that's happening with your peers in the space? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, look, consolidation in our space is inevitable. I'm not going to comment on any specific deals, but here's what I'll say. Autodesk has always been an acquisitive company, and we will be an inquisitive company when that makes both strategic and financial sense for the company. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst OK. Thank you. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Joe. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Porter of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Elizabeth. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great, thanks so much for the question. As partners are getting customers just up and running on the new transaction model, we picked up that they're spending a little bit more time than usual of time and resources with those existing customers. So, I was curious if that had any impact on new business demand kind of more recently -- and then just more broadly, any change in new business trends that you think you should call out from versus last quarter? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Elizabeth, it's Betsy. And so, just broadly speaking, we continue to see growth, but at a slower pace due to a number of factors really over the last several years, macro, COVID, exiting Russia, elections, and while a drag on the forward momentum of the business, all of that really factored into our guidance. So, I kind of just will leave it at that. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great. And then a follow-up just on billings. I understand there's a lot of volatility around the change from multiyear in the transaction model. But it looks like guidance implies a bigger step down in growth in Q4, just despite easier year-ago compare. So, hoping that you could help us unpack the balance of those headwinds and tailwinds that would drive kind of a greater downtick in growth in Q4. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, again, let me start out with just from a fiscal '25 perspective. Your billing tailwinds are going to be from the final shift to annual billings, new transaction model and early renewals. And you're going to get headwinds from co-terming and business booked ahead of the new transaction model launch and in recent weeks, some FX. So, again, I think that we've continued to perform well as we've executed through through Q3. And so, I think we feel very, very strongly about our expectations for Q4. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bhavin Shah of Deutsche Bank. Your question please, Bhavin. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Great, thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the quarter. Andrew, at university, there appeared to be a noticeable uptick in attendance and sessions geared toward owners and operators. What been driving the recent interest from the segment? How much of it is product enhancements you guys have made versus really more focusing and emphasizing from a go-to-market perspective? And how long before this segment of buyers kind of becomes more meaningful to the financials? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah, Bhavin, that's an excellent question, right. We're very interested in tackling the whole entire life cycle from design, through make, construction, manufacturing, all the way into operations. You're probably aware we have a product called Tandem. And a lot of those sessions were driven by increasing interest and increasing adoption of Tandem, which is a digital twin solution, tightly coupled to our solutions that also has a toolkit that allows people to easily connect sensor data through the digital twin solution. So, you're seeing that uptick because we're directly releasing products and capabilities that are of interest to the owner space. You can expect to see that trend continue over time, and you can expect to see us continue to talk about the owner space, continue to deliver solutions for the owner space and even APIs for the owner space. It's an area of great interest, especially when it comes not only to vertical buildings, but factories and other things that are related to that as well as, infrastructure like what we were doing with some of our water owner solutions. So, yes, owners matter. We're building software for them, and you're going to see more of that. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Super helpful there. And then, Betsy, one for you. Just in terms of the underlying improvement that we've been seeing in the margins, and I know you've called out FX and the transaction model. I know it's very early, but as you think about next year, how do we think about like the impact of FX and the transaction model to kind of the headline operating margins? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, I wish I could give you that answer, but I think that the new CFO would probably have a little bit of a problem with that. So, we'll wait till the end of February to give you more specifics on that. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Fair enough. Thanks for taking may questions. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Good try. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke of Citi. Please go ahead, Tyler. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Yeah, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I was going to ask you about a placeholder for next year's guidance, Betsy. don't want to waste a question on that, but feel free to answer. But Andrew, I wanted to kind of ask you about some of your comments you made around efficiency, especially as it relates to hiring Janesh, who you pointed out has a lot of experience at larger companies, VMware, Cisco, et cetera. Now that you're a few quarters into this transaction model rollout, you have kind of visibility better on some of the channel prior channel relationships, having that direct billing with the customer. What are some of the areas that you've identified as having that efficiency potential? And then as we think about that efficiency unlock, should we think about that as incremental to the free cash flow number you have out for next year? Or is that embedded in that already. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director So, many layers to that question. All right. First, let me kind of answer the question in a series of stages then dodge other ones, OK? So, first off, optimization is kind of a mindset at Autodesk. It's not something that that suddenly happens. I want to reemphasize that because if you look right now, this year, for example, when you look at the apples-to-apples comparison, which will be in the slide decks, are in our disclosed materials you can see that our non-GAAP margins are already hitting the targets we set for next year this year, OK? So, optimization is a mentality. You've also heard me say over and over again as the new transaction model starts to roll out, optimization of our go-to-market efforts is going to be a critical step for us and part of the optimization journey that we're on, that's going to deliver margin growth for the company for couple of years to come, OK? And I think that's important. It's a long-term driver. Now with getting into the specifics, OK? I think the specifics are probably for another time, but let me just kind of give you a sense for some of the things that are important, right? One is the drive to self-service, right? Self-service is a huge impact on how our customers will engage with us and where those customers come from, and that is value accretive to Autodesk, both on an efficiency side, from renewals and other things, but also on the revenue growth side through capturing the customers directly. The other thing I talked about is understanding the customer better, so the upsell and cross-sell. So, we're going to be able to do a lot more automation and understanding about where the opportunities are, and that's going to drive some efficiencies. And we're moving the channel partners away from this model of being the transactional players to being the solution providers and the IP providers to our customers. That's going to have all sorts of opportunities to eliminate duplication of effort and drive real cost efficiencies for the company moving forward. There's both top-line efficiencies here in revenue growth, but there's bottom line efficiencies as well through removing the redundancies and steps that just aren't necessary for the customer. You'll get a lot more clarity on that as you see us continue to move forward with this go-to-market optimization in the next year and beyond that. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Great. And then my follow-up question, Andrew, you talked about some really strong net new customer additions within the Construction Cloud, I think, doubling year over year. we also saw the Make revenue accelerate to 28% constant currency. Can you just help us understand, do you think that reacceleration is durable? And how are you sort of thinking about just your position there? What's been driving that strength in the new customer additions? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director First, let me comment on the make revenues, then I'm going to go into construction. So, the make revenue also includes some revenue from PIX and things associated with that. However, let's talk about the facts around our construction business because I think this is important, right? No. 1 factor is that we continue to drive consistent, high growth in our construction solutions. You're seeing it. It's built into the Make numbers, and it's the lion's share of those Make numbers. You're really seeing some consistent growth there. That's organically. Inorganically, we're actually executing incredibly well on things like Payapps, and that's driving acceleration of our growth. So, we are not decelerating as a business, OK? We are actually performing solidly inorganically, we're accelerating, all right? And I just want to be really clear about that. And yes, we said year over year, we drove a 2x increase in our new customers. And I'll talk about where some of that's coming from in just a minute. But I also want to highlight the other thing that's going on we are strengthening an already strong position in the ENR 400. So, you heard about the story about power construction, which was a great example of someone taking out a competitive RFP and say, look, I need a forward-looking cloud-based solution on new technology that goes end to end from design to construction all the way to operations. And they chose us. And that was just one example that we gave in the opening commentary. So, already a strengthening position in the ENR 400. Now the other qualitative things that are driving some of that new customer growth is we already have our distribution channel operating at scale. In the U.S., this is helping us go down market more effectively, which is allowing us to capture more customers more effectively be places where we weren't before and where others aren't, which is part of driving that. But also, we're already at scale operating internationally with our distribution channel. So, that's driving international growth for us. And that's a really important driver as well as, some of those net new accounts that you're seeing there. And the last thing I'll add that I'm done with construction is that, look, I heard this over and over again at AU, I'm hearing it over and over again from customers in lots of different places. They want the end-to-end solution. They want the licensed version in the cloud, they're placing bets for the next 10 years. They want to go from design to construction to operations, and that's just making our solution more attractive to the market. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo. Your question, please. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Hey, thanks very much. I appreciate you taking the questions. A commentary on the call sounded consistent, but wondering if there are any added details you can provide for us on just the overall macro spend environment and how that's maybe progressing across either key product segments or geos, whatever split you think is more useful. I think what we're trying to get a sense for is if there are any shades of improvement anywhere or if you'd characterize as mainly just consistent over the past couple of quarters. Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Michael, I think the core answer here is consistency, OK? We're seeing consistent trends that we've seen with -- in all the other quarters. There's always puts and takes in a large business like ours, especially ones as divers as ours. But the general tone is consistent with prior quarters. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer And I would just add that there's also been a lot of noise this year from the new transaction model and then obviously, the elections and leading up to that. And so, it's hard to sparse out kind of that particular behavior. So, I think as Andrew said, we call it consistent. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Yeah, tough for us, too. That's why we keep asking. Betsy, congrats on the transition back given you're also on the board. I think it'd be useful to hear you chime in on the hiring of Janesh and maybe just also comment on how you ensure you're able to hand over the reins and keep progress going on the key transitions the company is working through. Thanks. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Per se, I was involved in the process, which was quite extensive in the company and the recruiting of Janesh. And so, we're certainly very excited to have him on board. What I would also say is, obviously, with my experience of being on the board for 11 years as well as, my deep dive into the business over the last six months. One of the reasons I'm staying around until the end of the fiscal year, is I think I could be really helpful in that transition for Janesh. And so, I'm very much looking forward to it. And I think that we have a great finance team, and I think that he's going to fit very well, and I'm looking forward to making that happen as fast as we can. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. Your question, please, Matthew. Mike Richards -- Analyst Hey, guys. This is Mike Richards on for Matt. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could provide an update on Project Bernini and maybe how customer reception has been and where we are in developing other foundational models or just the monetization opportunity there? Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, first off, before I comment on Bernini, as you might have heard from AU, AI is embedded in everything we're doing from a bottom-up and a top-down perspective. And you also heard us talk at AU about new types of foundation models we're building that understand how certain things are done in our applications. You heard about a foundation model that's driving automated drawing creation. You heard about a foundation model that's driving automated sketch generation and sketch constraints. That kind of stuff is bottom-up innovation. Bernini more of a top-down type innovation where you're actually specifying things and trying to generate a preliminary outcome from those specifications. And what we've been doing with Bernini is we've been trying to engage with certain targeted customers to get them to participate with us in making Bernini smarter and more intelligent. It's not available commercially right now. but it's getting more intelligent. We've actually been successful in getting some customers to stand up and say, look, yes, I'd like to work with you to make this more intelligent because we need something that actually understands 3D geometry as geometry, not just in the picture or something, OK? So, that's what's going on with Bernini right now, and you should continue to see refinements and extensions of that moving forward. Now with regard to monetization, monetization, nobody knows exactly how all this is going to be monetized. But there's a few vectors here that that come into play. One, we are ahead of our competitors in this space. We intend to be ahead. We're investing to stay ahead. That increase ones competitive position in the marketplace, and that's really important. Also, you get to be able to charge for some of these incremental features in the future. When you're delivering value or a high-quality outcome as a result, you're going to charge for that outcome. How we charge for those things? Let's just play out, OK? It's still early days. But there's also monetization opportunities through licensing certain technologies for specific mature maturation for specific customers' needs, all right? And that will be another avenue. So, how these avenues play out, which one waits more, let this play out. But what you need to know about Autodesk is we're ahead. We've been ahead for a while. We were the first out there with an AI research lab that been out there for over six years. It's published 70 papers. We're right on the cutting edge of 3D design technology in AI, and we intend to stay there. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of J.P. Morgan. Your question please, Steve. Stephen Tusa -- Analyst Good evening or afternoon. Lots of good questions asked. Just a detailed one. What's the change in the billings contribution from the transaction model change? The five to six to five to five and a half. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Yeah. So, it's basically because we did more buy/sell business ahead of the European launch. It's short answer. So, remember, we said 5% to 6% when we launched Europe. And it was the -- we did more buy sell business, which means there's less tailwind from the new transaction model. The flip side of -- that means that the underlying increase in our billings guidance is greater than it looks on a headline basis. Stephen Tusa -- Analyst OK, great. Thanks a lot. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Tilton of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Hey, guys, can you hear me? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Great. I have a kind of a high-level one on the incoming CFO. If I heard correctly, we didn't exactly get like an initial outlook for revenue growth for next year. And I'm just trying to understand in the context of the new CFO coming in, is there anything that could change the calculus of how you guys think about that 10% to 15% growth for the underlying business outside of the agency transition that's ongoing today. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Well, first, let's talk about that framework a little bit, and then I'll comment a little bit on the incoming CFO. So, look, the 10% to 15% growth. Right now, we're pretty much right at the bottom end of that range. And if we look back over the last two years, there's been a series of things that created headwinds to new business. It started off with things like the pandemic, the inflation, the exiting of the Russian business, the writer's strike, the whole trade wars within particular geographies. All of these things were accumulated headwinds that build slowly into the business and have pushed us down to the low end of the range. it takes time in a subscription model for those things to build out of the business, OK? So, it's going to take time for us to build out of that. That's to be expected with a subscription model. The revenue goes down slowly. It goes back up slowly as headwinds turn into tailwinds. So, expect us to be near the bottom of that range in the short term just as a general kind of guideline for the core business to be at the bottom of the range, OK? As a long-term framework, the 10% to 15% still makes sense as a long-term guide for the company. But of course, as new eyes come in, we'll look at these things, and we'll evaluate them. But right now, this all still makes sense. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Super helpful. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho. Your question, please. Siti Panigrahi -- Analyst Thanks for taking my question. I understand the new business model of some kind of noise in your expense and margin side. But if you exclude that, where do you see some of the operating leverage that you can drive in next year or so? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, I think we've actually provided kind of historically what we've done over the last three years pretty clearly. And I think we said that we continue to be focused on expansion, but nothing further to add as far as next year. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director We did provide data on that. So, you can see what underlying thing is, and we expect to see continued improvement in that same vector. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations On the same basis. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director On the same basis, on the same apples-to-apples basis. Siti Panigrahi -- Analyst OK, great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Funk of Bank of America. Your question, please. Michael Funk -- Analyst Yeah. Guys, thank you for the question tonight. Two, if I could. You've mentioned a few times in the last calls about the largest multiyear cohort renewing next year and then also a large EBA cohort. Just wondering if you can give us kind of the range of potential outcomes among the renewals there, whether a potential to upsell, risk of down sell and what that variance might look like around those renewals? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer No. I mean I think what we have said is that it's the largest cohort and we saw that performance in '23. And so, we expect a strong renewal year, but we're not giving any specific guidance on what that looks like for '26 at this point, and we'll wait until we report earnings in February. Michael Funk -- Analyst OK. Great. And then, Betsy, one more. You've mentioned a few times after the investment in new transaction model, people processes, and automation, presumably more fixed cost versus variable like commission. Can you quantify that for us to help us with modeling as we try to forecast margin? I know you've not given guidance, but better understanding of what that cost might actually be on an absolute basis would help us to think about our modeling. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Mike, we've got a slide in the earnings deck to help you think about modeling. And I'll just point you to that. Michael Funk -- Analyst OK, great. Thank you, Simon. Operator Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for Q&A today. I would now like to turn the conference back to Simon Mays-Smith for closing remarks. Sir? Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Great. Thanks, Latif, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Looking forward to seeing many of you on the road over the next few weeks. If you have any questions in the meantime, please email me or call me. And in the meantime, for those of you in North America wishing you a very happy Thanksgiving. Thank you, Latif.

think past, usually march. good time frame? soon? thanks. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah. well, janesh joining december. think need give time get sea leg giving time kind drive end year actually get u set next fiscal year good stead. so, would say unlikely anything spring, get back soon janesh ready talk things. operator thank you. next question come line jay vleeschhouwer griffin securities. question, please. jay vleeschhouwer -- analyst thank you. andrew, third quarter, three-year cagr current rpo 12%. thinking sustainability perhaps improvement upon cagr crpo next number years? think ingredient that, look like last several years, cagr unit volume brand roughly 6% 7% aggregate. so, top that, price ingredients, perhaps talk think might able improve upon recent trajectory current rpo. follow-up. betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer yeah. hi, jay, betsy. let give couple things. there's number thing going on, headline crpo number. first take away headwind tailwind broadly consistent second quarter. mentioned opening commentary, early renewal growth -- new transaction model providing tailwind. there's also headwind crpo growth declining contribution billed unbilled deferred revenue risk large multiyear eba cohort coming renewal fiscal '26. reminder, larger cohort calling tailwind free cash flow next year. look back fiscal '22, saw dynamic ahead fiscal '23 renewal well. jay vleeschhouwer -- analyst ok. since new management part news evening, could talk thinking chief revenue officer position. would make sense perhaps continue separate cro? think might make sense perhaps combine cro coo? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah. so, going continue separate cro various function work together coo organization, including organization, infrastructure thing associated. looking cro someone understands continue drive business direct engagement customer. so, mean someone really understands take analyze self-service patterns, actually understand data come customer help drive cross-sell upsell also transforming channel transactionally focused extension autodesk kind solution partner that's driving life cycle solution customers. so, that's kind role looking here. yes, going continue stand-alone cro role within coo organization. jay vleeschhouwer -- analyst thank much. operator thank you. next question come line adam borg stifel. line open. adam borg -- analyst awesome. thanks much taking questions, congrats betsy janesh. maybe new transaction model. know still early. curious, learning customer new model seeing term adoption autodesk technology ability find white space better upsell cross-sell different solution direct relationship. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah, adam, really early able make kind conclusion that. tell definitely see shift direct channel autodesk customer probably served kind arm's length kind transactional level. term driving cross-sell upsell, early days, early days. want get sense might evolve, got experience ebas enterprise business agreements. learned year kind relationship customer really understand usage patterns, doing, much effective driving cross-sell upsell even partnering channel partners. so, think kind stand testament what's possible move forward completion new transaction model. adam borg -- analyst great. maybe quick follow-up. think new administration coming in, talked macro broadly consistent. change tone conversation end market term optimism ability willingness expand new project ahead administration? pause full steam ahead? curious, commentary macro perspective would really, really helpful. thanks much. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director say thing matter customer bipartisan things, right? customer care infrastructure build out. party care infrastructure build-outs. customer care domestic manufacturing europe, united states, party agree domestic manufacturing build-outs important. supply chain, independent, supply chain stability. thing bipartisan issue really affect customers. so, regardless administration, suspect thing important customer continuing focus. adam borg -- analyst thanks, again. operator thank you. next question come line joe vruwink baird. please go ahead, joe. joe vruwink -- analyst thank you. outlook next year, $2.050 billion free cash has, think, expectation past year now. within last year, also seen co-term contracts. think lead better billing fy '26. so, question is, actually create potential thing better, that's qualifying $2.050 billion midpoint possibilities. betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer there's change talked free cash flow guide fiscal '26, continues $2.05 billion mid-point. joe vruwink -- analyst ok. fair enough. m&a environment, recent history, autodesk mode of, would say, strategic tuck-ins. think actually asset cfd simulation space announced au quarter. right approach autodesk, given point time, work done build cloud platform, data models, tuck-ins make sense? that's true, would maybe compare contrast larger-scale m&a that's happening peer space? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah. so, look, consolidation space inevitable. going comment specific deals, here's say. autodesk always acquisitive company, inquisitive company make strategic financial sense company. joe vruwink -- analyst ok. thank you. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director thank you, joe. operator thank you. next question come line elizabeth porter morgan stanley. please go ahead, elizabeth. elizabeth porter -- analyst great, thanks much question. partner getting customer running new transaction model, picked spending little bit time usual time resource existing customers. so, curious impact new business demand kind recently -- broadly, change new business trend think call versus last quarter? betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer yeah. elizabeth, betsy. so, broadly speaking, continue see growth, slower pace due number factor really last several years, macro, covid, exiting russia, elections, drag forward momentum business, really factored guidance. so, kind leave that. elizabeth porter -- analyst great. follow-up billings. understand there's lot volatility around change multiyear transaction model. look like guidance implies bigger step growth q4, despite easier year-ago compare. so, hoping could help u unpack balance headwind tailwind would drive kind greater downtick growth q4. betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer well, again, let start fiscal '25 perspective. billing tailwind going final shift annual billings, new transaction model early renewals. going get headwind co-terming business booked ahead new transaction model launch recent weeks, fx. so, again, think continued perform well executed q3. so, think feel very, strongly expectation q4. elizabeth porter -- analyst great. thank you. operator thank you. next question come line bhavin shah deutsche bank. question please, bhavin. bhavin shah -- analyst great, thanks taking question, congrats quarter. andrew, university, appeared noticeable uptick attendance session geared toward owner operators. driving recent interest segment? much product enhancement guy made versus really focusing emphasizing go-to-market perspective? long segment buyer kind becomes meaningful financials? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah, bhavin, that's excellent question, right. interested tackling whole entire life cycle design, make, construction, manufacturing, way operations. probably aware product called tandem. lot session driven increasing interest increasing adoption tandem, digital twin solution, tightly coupled solution also toolkit allows people easily connect sensor data digital twin solution. so, seeing uptick directly releasing product capability interest owner space. expect see trend continue time, expect see u continue talk owner space, continue deliver solution owner space even apis owner space. area great interest, especially come vertical buildings, factory thing related well as, infrastructure like water owner solutions. so, yes, owner matter. building software them, going see that. bhavin shah -- analyst super helpful there. then, betsy, one you. term underlying improvement seeing margins, know called fx transaction model. know early, think next year, think like impact fx transaction model kind headline operating margins? betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer well, wish could give answer, think new cfo would probably little bit problem that. so, wait till end february give specific that. bhavin shah -- analyst fair enough. thanks taking may questions. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director good try. operator thank you. next question come line tyler radke citi. please go ahead, tyler. tyler radke -- analyst yeah, good afternoon. thanks taking questions. going ask placeholder next year's guidance, betsy. want waste question that, feel free answer. andrew, wanted kind ask comment made around efficiency, especially relates hiring janesh, pointed lot experience larger companies, vmware, cisco, et cetera. quarter transaction model rollout, kind visibility better channel prior channel relationships, direct billing customer. area identified efficiency potential? think efficiency unlock, think incremental free cash flow number next year? embedded already. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director so, many layer question. right. first, let kind answer question series stage dodge ones, ok? so, first off, optimization kind mindset autodesk. something suddenly happens. want reemphasize look right now, year, example, look apples-to-apples comparison, slide decks, disclosed material see non-gaap margin already hitting target set next year year, ok? so, optimization mentality. also heard say new transaction model start roll out, optimization go-to-market effort going critical step u part optimization journey on, that's going deliver margin growth company couple year come, ok? think that's important. long-term driver. getting specifics, ok? think specific probably another time, let kind give sense thing important, right? one drive self-service, right? self-service huge impact customer engage u customer come from, value accretive autodesk, efficiency side, renewal things, also revenue growth side capturing customer directly. thing talked understanding customer better, upsell cross-sell. so, going able lot automation understanding opportunity are, that's going drive efficiencies. moving channel partner away model transactional player solution provider ip provider customers. that's going sort opportunity eliminate duplication effort drive real cost efficiency company moving forward. there's top-line efficiency revenue growth, there's bottom line efficiency well removing redundancy step necessary customer. get lot clarity see u continue move forward go-to-market optimization next year beyond that. tyler radke -- analyst great. follow-up question, andrew, talked really strong net new customer addition within construction cloud, think, doubling year year. also saw make revenue accelerate 28% constant currency. help u understand, think reacceleration durable? sort thinking position there? what's driving strength new customer additions? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director first, let comment make revenues, going go construction. so, make revenue also includes revenue pix thing associated that. however, let's talk fact around construction business think important, right? no. 1 factor continue drive consistent, high growth construction solutions. seeing it. built make numbers, lion's share make numbers. really seeing consistent growth there. that's organically. inorganically, actually executing incredibly well thing like payapps, that's driving acceleration growth. so, decelerating business, ok?

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Simon Mays-Smith, VP, investor relations. Please go ahead. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Thanks, operator, and good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the third quarter results of Autodesk's fiscal '25. On the line with me is Andrew Anagnost, our CEO; and Betsy Rafael, our interim CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including outlook and related assumptions and on product and strategies. Actual events or results could differ materially. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-Q and the Form 8-K filed with today's press release for important risks and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today. If this call is replayed or reviewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Autodesk disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will quote several numeric or growth changes during this call as we discuss our financial performance. Unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison. All non-GAAP numbers referenced in today's call are reconciled in our press release or Excel financials and other supplemental materials available on our Investor Relations website. And now, I will turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Simon, and welcome, everyone, to the call. We finished the third quarter of the year strongly, delivering 12% revenue growth in constant currency and have again raised full year guidance. This reflects the sustained momentum of the business and successful execution of our strategy, including a smooth implementation of the new transaction model in Western Europe. Once again, opportunity, resilience and discipline underpinned our performance. Last month at Autodesk University in San Diego, we hosted 12,000 registered attendees and another 30,000 online. We showed how granular data in the cloud, organized the data models and connected to everything through APIs to deliver even more valuable and connected solutions for customers and partners and support a much broader ecosystem and marketplace. Customers and channel partners that I spoke with at AU remain cautiously optimistic, a sentiment consistent with the underlying momentum of our business, our growing product usage and BuildingConnected bid activity trends over recent quarters. I left AU with a tremendous sense of purpose and optimism in the ingenuity and persistence of our customers and for the future. On our earnings call last quarter, I set out our secular growth opportunities and our strategy to capitalize on them. I concluded that Autodesk's investment in cloud, platform and AI in pursuit of those opportunities were ahead of its peers. AU was a good demonstration of that. But we're also leading the industry in modernizing our go-to-market motion starting a few years ago with the subscription transition through consumption and self-service enablement and more recently to direct billing. These initiatives enable Autodesk to build larger and more durable direct relationships with its customers and to serve them more efficiently. We have already seen significant benefits from initiatives like these, and there's more to come in the next optimization phase. Taking out the effects on margins from FX and the new transaction model, we still expect to be toward the midpoint of our fiscal '26 non-GAAP operating margin target of 38% to 40% in fiscal '25, a year ahead of schedule. We're confident we will make further improvement in fiscal '26 on the same basis. The new transaction model will enable tighter channel partnerships with less duplication of effort and more digital self-service and automation, which increases customer satisfaction and workforce productivity. It will also create new opportunities for partners Autodesk to earn more with less emphasis on transaction revenue sharing and a greater emphasis on value creation for customers. Once complete, we expect the new transaction model and subsequent go-to-market optimization to increase sales and marketing efficiency and deliver GAAP margins among the best in the industry. Attractive, long-term, secular growth markets, a focused strategy delivering ever more valuable and connected solutions to our customers, and a resilient business are generating strong and sustained momentum, both in absolute terms and relative to peers. Disciplined execution and capital deployment has driven even greater operational velocity and efficiency within Autodesk and will underpin the mechanical build of revenue and free cash flow over the next few years and GAAP margins among the best in the industry. We will continue to deploy capital to offset and buy forward dilution as our free cash flow grows from the fiscal '24 trough. This practice has reduced our share count over the last three years. We have significantly increased our share repurchase authorization to extend this momentum flexibility over the medium term, with the precise trajectory remaining dependent on our debt repayment schedule and the ebb and flow of M&A. In combination, we believe these factors will deliver sustainable shareholder value over many years. Before I conclude, I'd like to formally welcome Janesh to Autodesk. We're excited to welcome Janesh, who brings a wealth of experience and will be instrumental in sustaining Autodesk's growth and enhanced profitability momentum. Of equal importance, I'd like to thank Betsy for stepping in as interim CFO at an important time in the company's journey, and I'm looking forward to continuing to work closely with her as an Autodesk Board member. I will now turn the call over to Betsy to discuss our quarterly financial performance and guidance for the year. I'll then return to provide an update on our strategic growth initiatives. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Andrew. Q3 was another strong quarter. We generated broad-based underlying growth across products and regions. In addition, we saw revenue increases from the new transaction model and M&A which were offset by the absence of enterprise business agreement true-ups from Q3 last year and FX. Our Make products continued to enhance growth, driven by our ongoing strength in construction and Fusion. Overall, macroeconomic policy and geopolitical challenges and the underlying momentum of the business were consistent with the last few quarters, with continued strong renewal rates and headwinds to our new business growth. Total revenue grew 11% and 12% in constant currency. By product, in constant currency, AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT revenue grew 8%. AEC revenue, which was most impacted by the absence of true-up revenues, grew 12%, Manufacturing revenue grew 16% and still comfortably in double digits, excluding upfront revenue. And M&E revenue grew 15% boosted by the PIX acquisition and associated integration adjustments. By region, in constant currency, revenue grew 11% in the Americas which was most impacted by the absence of true-up revenues, 13% in EMEA and 14% in APAC. The mechanical contribution from the new transaction model to revenue was $17 million in the third quarter and $25 million on a year-to-date basis. Direct revenue increased 23% and represented 42% of total revenue, up 4 percentage points from last year, benefiting from strong growth in both EBAs and the Autodesk store and also the natural tailwind to revenue from the new transaction model. Net revenue retention rate remained within the 100% to 110% range at constant exchange rates. Billings increased 28% in the quarter, reflecting a tailwind from the prior-year shift to annual billings for most multiyear contracts, early renewals and the natural tailwind from the transition to the new transaction model. Similar to last quarter, and as expected, co-terming negatively impacted billing ahead of the launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe. The natural contribution from the new transaction model to billing was $72 million in the third quarter and $108 million on a year-to-date basis. Total deferred revenue decreased 9% to $3.7 billion and was again impacted by the transition from upfront to annual billings for multiyear contracts. Total RPO of $6.1 billion and current RPO of $4.0 billion grew 17% and 14%, respectively, which reflects a tailwind from early renewals and the new transaction model and a headwind from the declining contribution of billed and unbilled deferred revenue from large, multiyear and EBA cohorts ahead of renewal in fiscal '26. Excluding these, current RPO growth was broadly consistent with Q2. We do expect the new transaction model and the larger FY '26 renewal cohorts to have a greater impact on both RPO and current RPO growth in Q4 of fiscal '25. Turning to margins. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were broadly low. With Autodesk University shifting back to Q3 this year from Q4 last year, GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins decreased by 2 and 3 percentage points, respectively. The timing effect from AU obviously washes out over the full year. At current course and speed, the ratio of stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue peaked in fiscal '24, will follow by more than a percentage point in fiscal '25 and will be below 10% over time. Free cash flow for the quarter was $199 million. This benefited from some channel partners in Western Europe booking business earlier in the quarter ahead of the transition to the new transaction model really to derisk month one after the transition. This accelerated free cash flow to the third quarter, which was partially offset by the expected negative impact of co-terming in Western Europe. Turning now to capital allocation. We continue to actively manage capital within our framework and deploy it with discipline and focus through the economic cycle to drive long-term shareholder value. As expected, the pace of buybacks picked up in the third quarter. We purchased approximately 1.2 million shares for $319 million at an average price of approximately $269 per share. We will continue to deploy capital to offset and buy forward dilution as our free cash flow grows from the fiscal '24 trough. This practice has reduced our share count by about 5 million shares over the last three years with an average percentage reduction of about 70 basis points per year. We increased the amount authorized under our share repurchase program by $5 billion for a total of approximately $9 billion. This expands our flexibility over the medium term with the precise trajectory remaining dependent on our debt repayment schedule as well as, the ebbs and flow of M&A. Now let me finish with guidance. As we said in the February, the pace of the rollout of the new transaction model will create noise in billings and the P&L. So, we think free cash flow is the best measure of our performance. Taking out that noise, the underlying momentum in the business remains consistent with the expectations embedded in our guidance range for the full year with continued strong renewal rates and headwinds to new business growth. Our sustained momentum in the third quarter and smooth launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe, reduced the likelihood of our more cautious forecast scenario. Given that, we're raising the midpoint of our billing, revenue, margin, earnings per share and free cash flow guidance ranges. So, let me give you a little bit more detail. The underlying momentum of billing is in line with our expectations. Compared to our modeling at the start of the year, the launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe in Q3 and early renewals have been a tailwind for billings, whereas more co-terming, more business done under the old buy-sell model before the launch of the new transaction model and in recent weeks, FX movement have been headwinds for billing. We now estimate that the new transaction model will provide between a 5 and 5.5 percentage point tailwind to billings growth in fiscal '25. We've raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 billings guidance by $10 million to a range of $5.90 billion to $5.98 billion. The underlying momentum of revenue is also in line with our expectations. We estimate the new transaction model will provide around 1 to 1.5 percentage point tailwind to revenue growth in fiscal '25. Upfront revenue contributed 2 percentage points to revenue growth in Q4 of fiscal '24, and therefore, this is a headwind in Q4 of fiscal '25. While not large enough to call out at the start of the year, it was already factored into our Q4 and our full year model. We've raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 revenue guidance range by $18 million to a range of $6.12 billion to $6.13 billion. We're increasing our GAAP and non-GAAP margin guidance midpoint by 25 basis points by raising the bottom end of the ranges by 50 basis points. The GAAP margin guidance range is now 21.5% to 22%. The non-GAAP margin guidance range is now 35.5% to 36%, which includes a 1 to 1.5 percentage point underlying margin improvement, broadly offset by the margin headwinds from the new transaction model and the related incremental investments in people, processes and automation. The underlying momentum of free cash flow is also in line with our expectations. The headwind to billings from co-terming and FX rates that I mentioned earlier, is being offset by early renewals, faster collections and improved underlying margins. We raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 free cash flow guidance by $10 million and tightened the range to $1.47 billion to $1.5 billion. We expect strong free cash flow growth in fiscal '26 because of the return of our largest multiyear renewal cohort the natural mechanical stacking of multiyear contracts billed annually and a larger EBA cohort. With our current trajectory, we still estimate free cash flow in fiscal '26 to be around $2.05 billion at the midpoint. The slide deck on our website has more details on modeling assumptions for Q3 and for the full fiscal year '25. And while this may be my last earnings call for Autodesk, I will stick around for a bit to ensure a smooth transition to Janesh. Thank you, Andrew, and everyone at Autodesk for your support while I was here and to the many investors and the analysts with whom I've had lively discussions over the last few quarters. While the transition to annual billings for multiyear contracts and the deployment of the new transaction model has created noise and billings in the P&L, they do provide a natural near-term tailwind to revenue and free cash flow growth. Combined with a resilient business model, sustained competitive momentum, Autodesk has enviable sources of visibility and certainty to very uncertain world. For all these reasons, I stepped down from my role as interim CFO with tremendous optimism for the future. Andrew, back to you. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Betsy. Let me finish by updating you on our strong progress in the third quarter. We continue to see good momentum in AEC, particularly in infrastructure and construction, fueled by customers consolidating onto our solutions to connect and optimize previously siloed workflows through the cloud. The cornerstone of that growing interest is our comprehensive end-to-end solutions in completing designs, preconstruction, field execution through handover and into operations. This breadth of connected capability enables us to extend our footprint further into infrastructure and construction and also expand our reach into the mid-market. As a sign of our growing momentum as the benefits of our end-to-end solution become more apparent, our construction business continue to perform robustly with net new customers doubling year over year and existing customers' renewal and expansion rates remaining strong. Let me give you a few examples. Power Construction is No. 79 on the Engineering News Record, ENR Top 400 U.S. contractor list. It is a Chicago-based general contractor serving residential and nonresidential end markets. After completing a competitive RFP to replace its legacy project management tool, Power selected Autodesk for its unified construction platform across preconstruction, construction, and DDC. By standardizing on Autodesk Construction Cloud, Power will have a single source of truth for project data, enhanced collaboration capabilities, and streamlined workflows on a single platform. Power Construction was one of two ENR 400 top 100 U.S. contractors that standardized enterprisewide on Autodesk build during the quarter. In Europe, Bouygues, a top 10 ENR 250 international contractor based in France and a leader in sustainable building and infrastructure projects renewed and expanded its EBA in the quarter. Bouygues is continuing to consolidate on Autodesk solutions across the enterprise, including broader adoption of Autodesk Forma, Carbon Insight, and Informed Design to digitize, decarbonize, and industrialize projects. It also significantly increased its commitment to Autodesk Construction Cloud to drive efficiency gains and faster bid response times through better collaboration between design and project teams. Surbana Jurong is No. 23 on ENR's top 225 international design firms. Based in Singapore, it is an urban infrastructure and integrated solutions consulting firm. In Q3, it renewed its third EBA, which included increased investment in Autodesk Construction Cloud and Autodesk Water infrastructure solutions. ACC is helping to scale its operations through increased automation, integrated design workflows and enhanced collaboration across time zones. Our water infrastructure solutions will be a core technology supporting its growth ambitions in planning, designing, engineering and managing water projects for customers worldwide. Again, these stories have a common theme. Managing people, processes and data across the project life cycle to increase efficiency and sustainability while decreasing risk. Over time, we expect the majority of all projects to be managed this way, and we remain focused on enabling that transition through our industry cloud. Moving on to manufacturing. We made excellent progress on our strategic initiatives. Customers continue to invest in their digital transformation and consolidate our Design and Make platform. Fusion remains one of the fastest-growing products in the manufacturing industry. As customers seek to drive innovation and growth at lower cost, Fusion extension attach rates are increasing, which is helping to drive the average sales price higher. For example, in the quarter, a global manufacturer supplying the semiconductor industry selected Fusion Manage and Vault PLM over competitive solutions to foster greater collaboration across manufacturing sites and improve operating efficiency. Once fully scaled and operational, this customer expects to save 105,000 hours per year by connecting people and data, resulting in reduced product development costs and faster time to market. In the U.K., Playdale Playground has been designing, manufacturing, and installing outdoor playground equipment for over 40 years. This quarter, Playdale added Fusion to its existing portfolio of Autodesk solutions, including Inventor, AutoCAD, and Vault to streamline and digitize workflows, optimize production to reduce lead times, reduce nonconformities, and replace inefficient Excel-driven operations on the shop floor. A long time Autodesk customer and global leader in precision engineering solutions renewed and expanded its EBA in the quarter. In addition to Inventor, vault and AutoCAD, it is adopting Fusion's generative design capabilities for material waste reduction and fluid flow optimization and Moldflow to reduce manufacturing costs and defects while increasing mold yields. In education, universities continue to modernize their courses and curriculum to attract and prepare future engineers. For example, from this winter, students at the University of Stuttgart, Institute for Medical Device Technology will use Fusion across six courses. Fusion was selected to replace a competitive solution for its modern platform, ease of use, cloud collaboration capabilities and unique combination of PCB and additive manufacturing workflows in a single team environment. And lastly, we continue to work with our customers to ensure they are using the latest and most secure versions of our software. For example, after a period of rapid scaling and diversification, a large multinational manufacturing company in APAC was looking to align compliance rates across its global employee base. Working collaboratively we address compliance issues while cementing a long-term partnership and completing one of our largest ever license compliance agreements, which included expanded adoption of Alias and VRED for the Design Studio and PDMC for mechanical engineering and rail design. Attractive long-term secular growth markets, a focused strategy delivering ever more valuable and connected solutions to our customers and a resilient business are generating strong and sustained momentum both in absolute terms and relative to peers. Disciplined execution and capital deployment is driving an even greater operational velocity and efficiency within Autodesk, and we continue to deploy capital to deliver sustainable shareholder value over many years. I retain a tremendous sense of purpose and optimism in the ingenuity and persistence of our customers and for the future. Operator, we would now like to open the call up for questions. Questions & Answers: Operator Thank you. [Operator instructions] Again, please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Jason Celino of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your question, please. Jason Celino -- Analyst Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Just two for me. The first one, Andrew. Some of us are unfamiliar with Janesh. Can you just tell us a little bit more about him and what he brings to Autodesk? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director I certainly can. Before I do that, let me make sure that I thank Betsy for everything she brought to Autodesk during this interim period. I really appreciate it. The company appreciates it. Thank you, Betsy. Now we're really excited about Janesh. Let me tell you why we're excited about Janesh. As you remember, one of the things I was telling you that I was looking for was someone that was going to be able to dispassionately drive optimization at scale inside of Autodesk. And what that really means is someone that's going to be really inwardly focused, looking at every dollar that we invest and making sure that we're getting the most return for the business that investors are getting the best return from their business. The next kind of criteria we were looking for, which was nice to have was, time in the seat as a sitting CFO, which was important for us as well. But it was kind of the next nice to have after the optimization at scale. Janesh brings a great balance of both of those things, right? He's been in the seat seven years at Elastic, both CFO and COO, driving some fairly turbulent changes inside of Elastic. So, he's got battle stars from pushing inside the company to get changes done inside, and we like that. We like that a lot. He's also got very good early experience at companies that we feel have always added value to Autodesk. So, he was it VMware in a senior position. He was at Cisco in a senior position. We've had good success bringing people from those kind of companies. He worked at those companies driving optimization at scale, which is the No. 1 criteria I was looking for when we we're driving this work. He also has another nice to have. He's got knowledge of our industry. He spent two years at PTC in his career. He was actually recently on the PTC board. So, he understands our industry, and he'll be able to get up to speed pretty quickly. The No. 1 goal here drive optimization and scale over the next few years, make sure that we're getting everything we need from every dollar we invest, which is a very important theme for Autodesk. And with that, I'm really excited, and I'm looking forward to him joining in December. Jason Celino -- Analyst OK. Great. Interesting. And then for my second question, now that you do have a CFO, do you have any thoughts on when you might hold the next Investor Day? I think in the past, you usually did it in March. Is that a good time frame? Or is that too soon? Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. Well, Janesh is joining in December. I think we need to give him time to get his sea legs on giving time to kind of drive the end of the year and actually get us set up for next fiscal year in good stead. So, I would say it's unlikely we'll be doing anything in the spring, but we'll get back to you on that as soon as Janesh is ready to talk about those things. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Your question, please. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst Thank you. Andrew, as of the third quarter, your three-year CAGR for current RPO is about 12%. How are you thinking about the sustainability or perhaps improvement upon that CAGR or CRPO over the next number of years? When we think about the ingredients of that, it looks like over the last several years, the CAGR for your unit volume for all brands is roughly 6% to 7% in the aggregate. So, on top of that, you've had price and other ingredients, but perhaps talk about how you think you might be able to improve upon the most recent trajectory for current RPO. Then my follow-up. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Hi, Jay, this is Betsy. Let me just give you a couple of things. There's a number of things that are going on, on the headline of the CRPO number. If you first take away the headwinds and the tailwinds was broadly consistent with the second quarter. And as I mentioned in my opening commentary, early renewals and growth with -- and the new transaction model are providing a tailwind. And then there's also a headwind to CRPO growth from the declining contribution of billed and unbilled deferred revenue risk from the large multiyear EBA cohorts coming up for renewal in fiscal '26. And just as a reminder, these are the same larger cohorts we are calling out as the tailwinds to free cash flow for next year. And if you look back to fiscal '22, we saw the same dynamic ahead of the fiscal '23 renewals as well. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst OK. Since new management is part of the news this evening, could you talk about how you're thinking about the chief revenue officer position. Would it make sense perhaps to continue to have a separate CRO? Or do you think it might make more sense perhaps to combine CRO and COO? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, we're going to continue to have a separate CRO because we have various functions that work together there under the COO organization, including our IT organization, our infrastructure and all things associated. What we're looking for in our CRO is someone that understands how to continue to drive a business when you have direct engagement with the customer. So, that means someone that really understands what it takes to analyze self-service patterns, actually understand the data that comes in from the customers to help drive cross-sell and upsell while also transforming a channel from a transactionally focused extension of Autodesk to kind of a solution partner that's driving life cycle solutions for our customers. So, that's the kind of role we're looking for here. And yes, it's going to continue to be a stand-alone CRO role within the COO organization. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Borg of Stifel. Your line is open. Adam Borg -- Analyst Awesome. Thanks so much for taking the questions, and congrats to Betsy and Janesh. Maybe on the new transaction model. I know it's still early. But I was just curious, are there any learnings from those customers that are on the new model that you're seeing in terms of the adoption of Autodesk technology and the ability to find white space to better upsell and cross-sell different solutions now that you have a more direct relationship. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah, Adam, it's really early on to be able to make any kind of conclusions about that. What I can tell you is that we definitely see some shifts to some of the direct channels at Autodesk for customers that were probably just served on a very kind of arm's length kind of transactional level. But in terms of driving cross-sell and upsell, early days, early days. But if you want to get a sense for how that might evolve, we've got experience with our EBAs and our enterprise business agreements. And we've learned over the years that having that kind of relationship with the customer where we really understand their usage patterns, who they are and what they're doing, we are much more effective at driving cross-sell and upsell even when partnering with our channel partners. So, I think those kind of stand as a testament of what's possible as we move forward with completion of the new transaction model. Adam Borg -- Analyst Great. And maybe just as a quick follow-up. Just as we think about the new administration coming in, you talked about the macro being broadly consistent. Any change in tone in your conversations with the end markets in terms of optimism or their ability or willingness to expand new projects ahead of the administration? Any pause or just full steam ahead? I'm just curious, any commentary you have there from a macro perspective would be really, really helpful. Thanks so much. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director What I'll say is the things that matter to our customers are bipartisan things, all right? Our customers care about infrastructure builds out. Both parties care about infrastructure build-outs. Our customers care about domestic manufacturing in Europe, be it in the United States, both parties agree that the domestic manufacturing build-outs are important. Supply chain, independent, supply chain stability. All of these things are bipartisan issues that really affect our customers. So, regardless of the administration, I suspect the things that are important to our customers are continuing to be a focus. Adam Borg -- Analyst Thanks, again. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink of Baird. Please go ahead, Joe. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst Thank you. On the outlook for next year, $2.050 billion in free cash has, I think, been the expectation for the past year now. Within the last year, you've also seen more co-term of contracts. And I think that leads to better billings in FY '26. So, my question is, does that actually create the potential that things are better, and that's why you're qualifying now the $2.050 billion as the midpoint of possibilities. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer There's no change to how we've talked about the free cash flow guide for fiscal '26, it continues to be $2.05 billion at the mid-point. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst OK. Fair enough. And then just on the M&A environment, over recent history, Autodesk has been more in a mode of, I would say, strategic tuck-ins. I think there is actually an asset in the CFD simulation space that was announced during AU in the quarter. Is that the right approach for Autodesk, just given this point in time, all the work you've done to build out the cloud platform, the data models, and so these tuck-ins make the most sense? And if that's true, how would you maybe compare and contrast some of the larger-scale M&A that's happening with your peers in the space? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, look, consolidation in our space is inevitable. I'm not going to comment on any specific deals, but here's what I'll say. Autodesk has always been an acquisitive company, and we will be an inquisitive company when that makes both strategic and financial sense for the company. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst OK. Thank you. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Joe. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Porter of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Elizabeth. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great, thanks so much for the question. As partners are getting customers just up and running on the new transaction model, we picked up that they're spending a little bit more time than usual of time and resources with those existing customers. So, I was curious if that had any impact on new business demand kind of more recently -- and then just more broadly, any change in new business trends that you think you should call out from versus last quarter? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Elizabeth, it's Betsy. And so, just broadly speaking, we continue to see growth, but at a slower pace due to a number of factors really over the last several years, macro, COVID, exiting Russia, elections, and while a drag on the forward momentum of the business, all of that really factored into our guidance. So, I kind of just will leave it at that. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great. And then a follow-up just on billings. I understand there's a lot of volatility around the change from multiyear in the transaction model. But it looks like guidance implies a bigger step down in growth in Q4, just despite easier year-ago compare. So, hoping that you could help us unpack the balance of those headwinds and tailwinds that would drive kind of a greater downtick in growth in Q4. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, again, let me start out with just from a fiscal '25 perspective. Your billing tailwinds are going to be from the final shift to annual billings, new transaction model and early renewals. And you're going to get headwinds from co-terming and business booked ahead of the new transaction model launch and in recent weeks, some FX. So, again, I think that we've continued to perform well as we've executed through through Q3. And so, I think we feel very, very strongly about our expectations for Q4. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bhavin Shah of Deutsche Bank. Your question please, Bhavin. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Great, thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the quarter. Andrew, at university, there appeared to be a noticeable uptick in attendance and sessions geared toward owners and operators. What been driving the recent interest from the segment? How much of it is product enhancements you guys have made versus really more focusing and emphasizing from a go-to-market perspective? And how long before this segment of buyers kind of becomes more meaningful to the financials? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah, Bhavin, that's an excellent question, right. We're very interested in tackling the whole entire life cycle from design, through make, construction, manufacturing, all the way into operations. You're probably aware we have a product called Tandem. And a lot of those sessions were driven by increasing interest and increasing adoption of Tandem, which is a digital twin solution, tightly coupled to our solutions that also has a toolkit that allows people to easily connect sensor data through the digital twin solution. So, you're seeing that uptick because we're directly releasing products and capabilities that are of interest to the owner space. You can expect to see that trend continue over time, and you can expect to see us continue to talk about the owner space, continue to deliver solutions for the owner space and even APIs for the owner space. It's an area of great interest, especially when it comes not only to vertical buildings, but factories and other things that are related to that as well as, infrastructure like what we were doing with some of our water owner solutions. So, yes, owners matter. We're building software for them, and you're going to see more of that. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Super helpful there. And then, Betsy, one for you. Just in terms of the underlying improvement that we've been seeing in the margins, and I know you've called out FX and the transaction model. I know it's very early, but as you think about next year, how do we think about like the impact of FX and the transaction model to kind of the headline operating margins? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, I wish I could give you that answer, but I think that the new CFO would probably have a little bit of a problem with that. So, we'll wait till the end of February to give you more specifics on that. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Fair enough. Thanks for taking may questions. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Good try. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke of Citi. Please go ahead, Tyler. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Yeah, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I was going to ask you about a placeholder for next year's guidance, Betsy. don't want to waste a question on that, but feel free to answer. But Andrew, I wanted to kind of ask you about some of your comments you made around efficiency, especially as it relates to hiring Janesh, who you pointed out has a lot of experience at larger companies, VMware, Cisco, et cetera. Now that you're a few quarters into this transaction model rollout, you have kind of visibility better on some of the channel prior channel relationships, having that direct billing with the customer. What are some of the areas that you've identified as having that efficiency potential? And then as we think about that efficiency unlock, should we think about that as incremental to the free cash flow number you have out for next year? Or is that embedded in that already. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director So, many layers to that question. All right. First, let me kind of answer the question in a series of stages then dodge other ones, OK? So, first off, optimization is kind of a mindset at Autodesk. It's not something that that suddenly happens. I want to reemphasize that because if you look right now, this year, for example, when you look at the apples-to-apples comparison, which will be in the slide decks, are in our disclosed materials you can see that our non-GAAP margins are already hitting the targets we set for next year this year, OK? So, optimization is a mentality. You've also heard me say over and over again as the new transaction model starts to roll out, optimization of our go-to-market efforts is going to be a critical step for us and part of the optimization journey that we're on, that's going to deliver margin growth for the company for couple of years to come, OK? And I think that's important. It's a long-term driver. Now with getting into the specifics, OK? I think the specifics are probably for another time, but let me just kind of give you a sense for some of the things that are important, right? One is the drive to self-service, right? Self-service is a huge impact on how our customers will engage with us and where those customers come from, and that is value accretive to Autodesk, both on an efficiency side, from renewals and other things, but also on the revenue growth side through capturing the customers directly. The other thing I talked about is understanding the customer better, so the upsell and cross-sell. So, we're going to be able to do a lot more automation and understanding about where the opportunities are, and that's going to drive some efficiencies. And we're moving the channel partners away from this model of being the transactional players to being the solution providers and the IP providers to our customers. That's going to have all sorts of opportunities to eliminate duplication of effort and drive real cost efficiencies for the company moving forward. There's both top-line efficiencies here in revenue growth, but there's bottom line efficiencies as well through removing the redundancies and steps that just aren't necessary for the customer. You'll get a lot more clarity on that as you see us continue to move forward with this go-to-market optimization in the next year and beyond that. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Great. And then my follow-up question, Andrew, you talked about some really strong net new customer additions within the Construction Cloud, I think, doubling year over year. we also saw the Make revenue accelerate to 28% constant currency. Can you just help us understand, do you think that reacceleration is durable? And how are you sort of thinking about just your position there? What's been driving that strength in the new customer additions? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director First, let me comment on the make revenues, then I'm going to go into construction. So, the make revenue also includes some revenue from PIX and things associated with that. However, let's talk about the facts around our construction business because I think this is important, right? No. 1 factor is that we continue to drive consistent, high growth in our construction solutions. You're seeing it. It's built into the Make numbers, and it's the lion's share of those Make numbers. You're really seeing some consistent growth there. That's organically. Inorganically, we're actually executing incredibly well on things like Payapps, and that's driving acceleration of our growth. So, we are not decelerating as a business, OK? We are actually performing solidly inorganically, we're accelerating, all right? And I just want to be really clear about that. And yes, we said year over year, we drove a 2x increase in our new customers. And I'll talk about where some of that's coming from in just a minute. But I also want to highlight the other thing that's going on we are strengthening an already strong position in the ENR 400. So, you heard about the story about power construction, which was a great example of someone taking out a competitive RFP and say, look, I need a forward-looking cloud-based solution on new technology that goes end to end from design to construction all the way to operations. And they chose us. And that was just one example that we gave in the opening commentary. So, already a strengthening position in the ENR 400. Now the other qualitative things that are driving some of that new customer growth is we already have our distribution channel operating at scale. In the U.S., this is helping us go down market more effectively, which is allowing us to capture more customers more effectively be places where we weren't before and where others aren't, which is part of driving that. But also, we're already at scale operating internationally with our distribution channel. So, that's driving international growth for us. And that's a really important driver as well as, some of those net new accounts that you're seeing there. And the last thing I'll add that I'm done with construction is that, look, I heard this over and over again at AU, I'm hearing it over and over again from customers in lots of different places. They want the end-to-end solution. They want the licensed version in the cloud, they're placing bets for the next 10 years. They want to go from design to construction to operations, and that's just making our solution more attractive to the market. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo. Your question, please. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Hey, thanks very much. I appreciate you taking the questions. A commentary on the call sounded consistent, but wondering if there are any added details you can provide for us on just the overall macro spend environment and how that's maybe progressing across either key product segments or geos, whatever split you think is more useful. I think what we're trying to get a sense for is if there are any shades of improvement anywhere or if you'd characterize as mainly just consistent over the past couple of quarters. Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Michael, I think the core answer here is consistency, OK? We're seeing consistent trends that we've seen with -- in all the other quarters. There's always puts and takes in a large business like ours, especially ones as divers as ours. But the general tone is consistent with prior quarters. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer And I would just add that there's also been a lot of noise this year from the new transaction model and then obviously, the elections and leading up to that. And so, it's hard to sparse out kind of that particular behavior. So, I think as Andrew said, we call it consistent. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Yeah, tough for us, too. That's why we keep asking. Betsy, congrats on the transition back given you're also on the board. I think it'd be useful to hear you chime in on the hiring of Janesh and maybe just also comment on how you ensure you're able to hand over the reins and keep progress going on the key transitions the company is working through. Thanks. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Per se, I was involved in the process, which was quite extensive in the company and the recruiting of Janesh. And so, we're certainly very excited to have him on board. What I would also say is, obviously, with my experience of being on the board for 11 years as well as, my deep dive into the business over the last six months. One of the reasons I'm staying around until the end of the fiscal year, is I think I could be really helpful in that transition for Janesh. And so, I'm very much looking forward to it. And I think that we have a great finance team, and I think that he's going to fit very well, and I'm looking forward to making that happen as fast as we can. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. Your question, please, Matthew. Mike Richards -- Analyst Hey, guys. This is Mike Richards on for Matt. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could provide an update on Project Bernini and maybe how customer reception has been and where we are in developing other foundational models or just the monetization opportunity there? Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, first off, before I comment on Bernini, as you might have heard from AU, AI is embedded in everything we're doing from a bottom-up and a top-down perspective. And you also heard us talk at AU about new types of foundation models we're building that understand how certain things are done in our applications. You heard about a foundation model that's driving automated drawing creation. You heard about a foundation model that's driving automated sketch generation and sketch constraints. That kind of stuff is bottom-up innovation. Bernini more of a top-down type innovation where you're actually specifying things and trying to generate a preliminary outcome from those specifications. And what we've been doing with Bernini is we've been trying to engage with certain targeted customers to get them to participate with us in making Bernini smarter and more intelligent. It's not available commercially right now. but it's getting more intelligent. We've actually been successful in getting some customers to stand up and say, look, yes, I'd like to work with you to make this more intelligent because we need something that actually understands 3D geometry as geometry, not just in the picture or something, OK? So, that's what's going on with Bernini right now, and you should continue to see refinements and extensions of that moving forward. Now with regard to monetization, monetization, nobody knows exactly how all this is going to be monetized. But there's a few vectors here that that come into play. One, we are ahead of our competitors in this space. We intend to be ahead. We're investing to stay ahead. That increase ones competitive position in the marketplace, and that's really important. Also, you get to be able to charge for some of these incremental features in the future. When you're delivering value or a high-quality outcome as a result, you're going to charge for that outcome. How we charge for those things? Let's just play out, OK? It's still early days. But there's also monetization opportunities through licensing certain technologies for specific mature maturation for specific customers' needs, all right? And that will be another avenue. So, how these avenues play out, which one waits more, let this play out. But what you need to know about Autodesk is we're ahead. We've been ahead for a while. We were the first out there with an AI research lab that been out there for over six years. It's published 70 papers. We're right on the cutting edge of 3D design technology in AI, and we intend to stay there. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of J.P. Morgan. Your question please, Steve. Stephen Tusa -- Analyst Good evening or afternoon. Lots of good questions asked. Just a detailed one. What's the change in the billings contribution from the transaction model change? The five to six to five to five and a half. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Yeah. So, it's basically because we did more buy/sell business ahead of the European launch. It's short answer. So, remember, we said 5% to 6% when we launched Europe. And it was the -- we did more buy sell business, which means there's less tailwind from the new transaction model. The flip side of -- that means that the underlying increase in our billings guidance is greater than it looks on a headline basis. Stephen Tusa -- Analyst OK, great. Thanks a lot. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Tilton of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Hey, guys, can you hear me? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Great. I have a kind of a high-level one on the incoming CFO. If I heard correctly, we didn't exactly get like an initial outlook for revenue growth for next year. And I'm just trying to understand in the context of the new CFO coming in, is there anything that could change the calculus of how you guys think about that 10% to 15% growth for the underlying business outside of the agency transition that's ongoing today. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Well, first, let's talk about that framework a little bit, and then I'll comment a little bit on the incoming CFO. So, look, the 10% to 15% growth. Right now, we're pretty much right at the bottom end of that range. And if we look back over the last two years, there's been a series of things that created headwinds to new business. It started off with things like the pandemic, the inflation, the exiting of the Russian business, the writer's strike, the whole trade wars within particular geographies. All of these things were accumulated headwinds that build slowly into the business and have pushed us down to the low end of the range. it takes time in a subscription model for those things to build out of the business, OK? So, it's going to take time for us to build out of that. That's to be expected with a subscription model. The revenue goes down slowly. It goes back up slowly as headwinds turn into tailwinds. So, expect us to be near the bottom of that range in the short term just as a general kind of guideline for the core business to be at the bottom of the range, OK? As a long-term framework, the 10% to 15% still makes sense as a long-term guide for the company. But of course, as new eyes come in, we'll look at these things, and we'll evaluate them. But right now, this all still makes sense. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Super helpful. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho. Your question, please. Siti Panigrahi -- Analyst Thanks for taking my question. I understand the new business model of some kind of noise in your expense and margin side. But if you exclude that, where do you see some of the operating leverage that you can drive in next year or so? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, I think we've actually provided kind of historically what we've done over the last three years pretty clearly. And I think we said that we continue to be focused on expansion, but nothing further to add as far as next year. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director We did provide data on that. So, you can see what underlying thing is, and we expect to see continued improvement in that same vector. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations On the same basis. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director On the same basis, on the same apples-to-apples basis. Siti Panigrahi -- Analyst OK, great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Funk of Bank of America. Your question, please. Michael Funk -- Analyst Yeah. Guys, thank you for the question tonight. Two, if I could. You've mentioned a few times in the last calls about the largest multiyear cohort renewing next year and then also a large EBA cohort. Just wondering if you can give us kind of the range of potential outcomes among the renewals there, whether a potential to upsell, risk of down sell and what that variance might look like around those renewals? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer No. I mean I think what we have said is that it's the largest cohort and we saw that performance in '23. And so, we expect a strong renewal year, but we're not giving any specific guidance on what that looks like for '26 at this point, and we'll wait until we report earnings in February. Michael Funk -- Analyst OK. Great. And then, Betsy, one more. You've mentioned a few times after the investment in new transaction model, people processes, and automation, presumably more fixed cost versus variable like commission. Can you quantify that for us to help us with modeling as we try to forecast margin? I know you've not given guidance, but better understanding of what that cost might actually be on an absolute basis would help us to think about our modeling. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Mike, we've got a slide in the earnings deck to help you think about modeling. And I'll just point you to that. Michael Funk -- Analyst OK, great. Thank you, Simon. Operator Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for Q&A today. I would now like to turn the conference back to Simon Mays-Smith for closing remarks. Sir? Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Great. Thanks, Latif, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Looking forward to seeing many of you on the road over the next few weeks. If you have any questions in the meantime, please email me or call me. And in the meantime, for those of you in North America wishing you a very happy Thanksgiving. Thank you, Latif.

[operator instructions] again, please stand compile q&a roster. first question come line jason celino keybanc capital markets. question, please. jason celino -- analyst hey, thanks taking questions. two me. first one, andrew. u unfamiliar janesh. tell u little bit brings autodesk? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director certainly can. that, let make sure thank betsy everything brought autodesk interim period. really appreciate it. company appreciates it. thank you, betsy. really excited janesh. let tell excited janesh. remember, one thing telling looking someone going able dispassionately drive optimization scale inside autodesk. really mean someone that's going really inwardly focused, looking every dollar invest making sure getting return business investor getting best return business. next kind criterion looking for, nice was, time seat sitting cfo, important u well. kind next nice optimization scale. janesh brings great balance things, right? seat seven year elastic, cfo coo, driving fairly turbulent change inside elastic. so, got battle star pushing inside company get change done inside, like that. like lot. also got good early experience company feel always added value autodesk. so, vmware senior position. cisco senior position. good success bringing people kind companies. worked company driving optimization scale, no. 1 criterion looking driving work. also another nice have. got knowledge industry. spent two year ptc career. actually recently ptc board. so, understands industry, able get speed pretty quickly. no. 1 goal drive optimization scale next years, make sure getting everything need every dollar invest, important theme autodesk. that, really excited, looking forward joining december. jason celino -- analyst ok. great. interesting. second question, cfo, thought might hold next investor day? think past, usually march. good time frame? soon? thanks. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah. well, janesh joining december. think need give time get sea leg giving time kind drive end year actually get u set next fiscal year good stead. so, would say unlikely anything spring, get back soon janesh ready talk things. operator thank you. next question come line jay vleeschhouwer griffin securities. question, please. jay vleeschhouwer -- analyst thank you. andrew, third quarter, three-year cagr current rpo 12%. thinking sustainability perhaps improvement upon cagr crpo next number years? think ingredient that, look like last several years, cagr unit volume brand roughly 6% 7% aggregate. so, top that, price ingredients, perhaps talk think might able improve upon recent trajectory current rpo. follow-up. betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer yeah. hi, jay, betsy. let give couple things. there's number thing going on, headline crpo number. first take away headwind tailwind broadly consistent second quarter. mentioned opening commentary, early renewal growth -- new transaction model providing tailwind. there's also headwind crpo growth declining contribution billed unbilled deferred revenue risk large multiyear eba cohort coming renewal fiscal '26. reminder, larger cohort calling tailwind free cash flow next year. look back fiscal '22, saw dynamic ahead fiscal '23 renewal well. jay vleeschhouwer -- analyst ok. since new management part news evening, could talk thinking chief revenue officer position. would make sense perhaps continue separate cro? think might make sense perhaps combine cro coo? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah. so, going continue separate cro various function work together coo organization, including organization, infrastructure thing associated. looking cro someone understands continue drive business direct engagement customer. so, mean someone really understands take analyze self-service patterns, actually understand data come customer help drive cross-sell upsell also transforming channel transactionally focused extension autodesk kind solution partner that's driving life cycle solution customers. so, that's kind role looking here. yes, going continue stand-alone cro role within coo organization. jay vleeschhouwer -- analyst thank much. operator thank you. next question come line adam borg stifel. line open. adam borg -- analyst awesome. thanks much taking questions, congrats betsy janesh. maybe new transaction model. know still early. curious, learning customer new model seeing term adoption autodesk technology ability find white space better upsell cross-sell different solution direct relationship. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah, adam, really early able make kind conclusion that. tell definitely see shift direct channel autodesk customer probably served kind arm's length kind transactional level. term driving cross-sell upsell, early days, early days. want get sense might evolve, got experience ebas enterprise business agreements. learned year kind relationship customer really understand usage patterns, doing, much effective driving cross-sell upsell even partnering channel partners. so, think kind stand testament what's possible move forward completion new transaction model. adam borg -- analyst great. maybe quick follow-up. think new administration coming in, talked macro broadly consistent. change tone conversation end market term optimism ability willingness expand new project ahead administration? pause full steam ahead? curious, commentary macro perspective would really, really helpful. thanks much. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director say thing matter customer bipartisan things, right? customer care infrastructure build out. party care infrastructure build-outs. customer care domestic manufacturing europe, united states, party agree domestic manufacturing build-outs important. supply chain, independent, supply chain stability. thing bipartisan issue really affect customers. so, regardless administration, suspect thing important customer continuing focus. adam borg -- analyst thanks, again. operator thank you. next question come line joe vruwink baird. please go ahead, joe. joe vruwink -- analyst thank you. outlook next year, $2.050 billion free cash has, think, expectation past year now. within last year, also seen co-term contracts. think lead better billing fy '26. so, question is, actually create potential thing better, that's qualifying $2.050 billion midpoint possibilities. betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer there's change talked free cash flow guide fiscal '26, continues $2.05 billion mid-point. joe vruwink -- analyst ok. fair enough. m&a environment, recent history, autodesk mode of, would say, strategic tuck-ins. think actually asset cfd simulation space announced au quarter. right approach autodesk, given point time, work done build cloud platform, data models, tuck-ins make sense? that's true, would maybe compare contrast larger-scale m&a that's happening peer space? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah. so, look, consolidation space inevitable. going comment specific deals, here's say. autodesk always acquisitive company, inquisitive company make strategic financial sense company. joe vruwink -- analyst ok. thank you. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director thank you, joe. operator thank you. next question come line elizabeth porter morgan stanley. please go ahead, elizabeth. elizabeth porter -- analyst great, thanks much question. partner getting customer running new transaction model, picked spending little bit time usual time resource existing customers. so, curious impact new business demand kind recently -- broadly, change new business trend think call versus last quarter? betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer yeah. elizabeth, betsy. so, broadly speaking, continue see growth, slower pace due number factor really last several years, macro, covid, exiting russia, elections, drag forward momentum business, really factored guidance. so, kind leave that. elizabeth porter -- analyst great. follow-up billings. understand there's lot volatility around change multiyear transaction model. look like guidance implies bigger step growth q4, despite easier year-ago compare. so, hoping could help u unpack balance headwind tailwind would drive kind greater downtick growth q4. betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer well, again, let start fiscal '25 perspective. billing tailwind going final shift annual billings, new transaction model early renewals. going get headwind co-terming business booked ahead new transaction model launch recent weeks, fx. so, again, think continued perform well executed q3. so, think feel very, strongly expectation q4. elizabeth porter -- analyst great. thank you. operator thank you. next question come line bhavin shah deutsche bank. question please, bhavin. bhavin shah -- analyst great, thanks taking question, congrats quarter. andrew, university, appeared noticeable uptick attendance session geared toward owner operators. driving recent interest segment? much product enhancement guy made versus really focusing emphasizing go-to-market perspective? long segment buyer kind becomes meaningful financials? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah, bhavin, that's excellent question, right. interested tackling whole entire life cycle design, make, construction, manufacturing, way operations. probably aware product called tandem. lot session driven increasing interest increasing adoption tandem, digital twin solution, tightly coupled solution also toolkit allows people easily connect sensor data digital twin solution. so, seeing uptick directly releasing product capability interest owner space. expect see trend continue time, expect see u continue talk owner space, continue deliver solution owner space even apis owner space. area great interest, especially come vertical buildings, factory thing related well as, infrastructure like water owner solutions. so, yes, owner matter. building software them, going see that. bhavin shah -- analyst super helpful there. then, betsy, one you. term underlying improvement seeing margins, know called fx transaction model. know early, think next year, think like impact fx transaction model kind headline operating margins? betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer well, wish could give answer, think new cfo would probably little bit problem that. so, wait till end february give specific that. bhavin shah -- analyst fair enough. thanks taking may questions. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director good try. operator thank you. next question come line tyler radke citi. please go ahead, tyler. tyler radke -- analyst yeah, good afternoon. thanks taking questions. going ask placeholder next year's guidance, betsy. want waste question that, feel free answer. andrew, wanted kind ask comment made around efficiency, especially relates hiring janesh, pointed lot experience larger companies, vmware, cisco, et cetera. quarter transaction model rollout, kind visibility better channel prior channel relationships, direct billing customer. area identified efficiency potential? think efficiency unlock, think incremental free cash flow number next year? embedded already. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director so, many layer question. right. first, let kind answer question series stage dodge ones, ok? so, first off, optimization kind mindset autodesk. something suddenly happens. want reemphasize look right now, year, example, look apples-to-apples comparison, slide decks, disclosed material see non-gaap margin already hitting target set next year year, ok? so, optimization mentality. also heard say new transaction model start roll out, optimization go-to-market effort going critical step u part optimization journey on, that's going deliver margin growth company couple year come, ok? think that's important. long-term driver. getting specifics, ok? think specific probably another time, let kind give sense thing important, right? one drive self-service, right? self-service huge impact customer engage u customer come from, value accretive autodesk, efficiency side, renewal things, also revenue growth side capturing customer directly. thing talked understanding customer better, upsell cross-sell. so, going able lot automation understanding opportunity are, that's going drive efficiencies. moving channel partner away model transactional player solution provider ip provider customers. that's going sort opportunity eliminate duplication effort drive real cost efficiency company moving forward. there's top-line efficiency revenue growth, there's bottom line efficiency well removing redundancy step necessary customer. get lot clarity see u continue move forward go-to-market optimization next year beyond that. tyler radke -- analyst great. follow-up question, andrew, talked really strong net new customer addition within construction cloud, think, doubling year year. also saw make revenue accelerate 28% constant currency. help u understand, think reacceleration durable?

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Simon Mays-Smith, VP, investor relations. Please go ahead. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Thanks, operator, and good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the third quarter results of Autodesk's fiscal '25. On the line with me is Andrew Anagnost, our CEO; and Betsy Rafael, our interim CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including outlook and related assumptions and on product and strategies. Actual events or results could differ materially. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-Q and the Form 8-K filed with today's press release for important risks and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today. If this call is replayed or reviewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Autodesk disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will quote several numeric or growth changes during this call as we discuss our financial performance. Unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison. All non-GAAP numbers referenced in today's call are reconciled in our press release or Excel financials and other supplemental materials available on our Investor Relations website. And now, I will turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Simon, and welcome, everyone, to the call. We finished the third quarter of the year strongly, delivering 12% revenue growth in constant currency and have again raised full year guidance. This reflects the sustained momentum of the business and successful execution of our strategy, including a smooth implementation of the new transaction model in Western Europe. Once again, opportunity, resilience and discipline underpinned our performance. Last month at Autodesk University in San Diego, we hosted 12,000 registered attendees and another 30,000 online. We showed how granular data in the cloud, organized the data models and connected to everything through APIs to deliver even more valuable and connected solutions for customers and partners and support a much broader ecosystem and marketplace. Customers and channel partners that I spoke with at AU remain cautiously optimistic, a sentiment consistent with the underlying momentum of our business, our growing product usage and BuildingConnected bid activity trends over recent quarters. I left AU with a tremendous sense of purpose and optimism in the ingenuity and persistence of our customers and for the future. On our earnings call last quarter, I set out our secular growth opportunities and our strategy to capitalize on them. I concluded that Autodesk's investment in cloud, platform and AI in pursuit of those opportunities were ahead of its peers. AU was a good demonstration of that. But we're also leading the industry in modernizing our go-to-market motion starting a few years ago with the subscription transition through consumption and self-service enablement and more recently to direct billing. These initiatives enable Autodesk to build larger and more durable direct relationships with its customers and to serve them more efficiently. We have already seen significant benefits from initiatives like these, and there's more to come in the next optimization phase. Taking out the effects on margins from FX and the new transaction model, we still expect to be toward the midpoint of our fiscal '26 non-GAAP operating margin target of 38% to 40% in fiscal '25, a year ahead of schedule. We're confident we will make further improvement in fiscal '26 on the same basis. The new transaction model will enable tighter channel partnerships with less duplication of effort and more digital self-service and automation, which increases customer satisfaction and workforce productivity. It will also create new opportunities for partners Autodesk to earn more with less emphasis on transaction revenue sharing and a greater emphasis on value creation for customers. Once complete, we expect the new transaction model and subsequent go-to-market optimization to increase sales and marketing efficiency and deliver GAAP margins among the best in the industry. Attractive, long-term, secular growth markets, a focused strategy delivering ever more valuable and connected solutions to our customers, and a resilient business are generating strong and sustained momentum, both in absolute terms and relative to peers. Disciplined execution and capital deployment has driven even greater operational velocity and efficiency within Autodesk and will underpin the mechanical build of revenue and free cash flow over the next few years and GAAP margins among the best in the industry. We will continue to deploy capital to offset and buy forward dilution as our free cash flow grows from the fiscal '24 trough. This practice has reduced our share count over the last three years. We have significantly increased our share repurchase authorization to extend this momentum flexibility over the medium term, with the precise trajectory remaining dependent on our debt repayment schedule and the ebb and flow of M&A. In combination, we believe these factors will deliver sustainable shareholder value over many years. Before I conclude, I'd like to formally welcome Janesh to Autodesk. We're excited to welcome Janesh, who brings a wealth of experience and will be instrumental in sustaining Autodesk's growth and enhanced profitability momentum. Of equal importance, I'd like to thank Betsy for stepping in as interim CFO at an important time in the company's journey, and I'm looking forward to continuing to work closely with her as an Autodesk Board member. I will now turn the call over to Betsy to discuss our quarterly financial performance and guidance for the year. I'll then return to provide an update on our strategic growth initiatives. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Andrew. Q3 was another strong quarter. We generated broad-based underlying growth across products and regions. In addition, we saw revenue increases from the new transaction model and M&A which were offset by the absence of enterprise business agreement true-ups from Q3 last year and FX. Our Make products continued to enhance growth, driven by our ongoing strength in construction and Fusion. Overall, macroeconomic policy and geopolitical challenges and the underlying momentum of the business were consistent with the last few quarters, with continued strong renewal rates and headwinds to our new business growth. Total revenue grew 11% and 12% in constant currency. By product, in constant currency, AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT revenue grew 8%. AEC revenue, which was most impacted by the absence of true-up revenues, grew 12%, Manufacturing revenue grew 16% and still comfortably in double digits, excluding upfront revenue. And M&E revenue grew 15% boosted by the PIX acquisition and associated integration adjustments. By region, in constant currency, revenue grew 11% in the Americas which was most impacted by the absence of true-up revenues, 13% in EMEA and 14% in APAC. The mechanical contribution from the new transaction model to revenue was $17 million in the third quarter and $25 million on a year-to-date basis. Direct revenue increased 23% and represented 42% of total revenue, up 4 percentage points from last year, benefiting from strong growth in both EBAs and the Autodesk store and also the natural tailwind to revenue from the new transaction model. Net revenue retention rate remained within the 100% to 110% range at constant exchange rates. Billings increased 28% in the quarter, reflecting a tailwind from the prior-year shift to annual billings for most multiyear contracts, early renewals and the natural tailwind from the transition to the new transaction model. Similar to last quarter, and as expected, co-terming negatively impacted billing ahead of the launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe. The natural contribution from the new transaction model to billing was $72 million in the third quarter and $108 million on a year-to-date basis. Total deferred revenue decreased 9% to $3.7 billion and was again impacted by the transition from upfront to annual billings for multiyear contracts. Total RPO of $6.1 billion and current RPO of $4.0 billion grew 17% and 14%, respectively, which reflects a tailwind from early renewals and the new transaction model and a headwind from the declining contribution of billed and unbilled deferred revenue from large, multiyear and EBA cohorts ahead of renewal in fiscal '26. Excluding these, current RPO growth was broadly consistent with Q2. We do expect the new transaction model and the larger FY '26 renewal cohorts to have a greater impact on both RPO and current RPO growth in Q4 of fiscal '25. Turning to margins. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were broadly low. With Autodesk University shifting back to Q3 this year from Q4 last year, GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins decreased by 2 and 3 percentage points, respectively. The timing effect from AU obviously washes out over the full year. At current course and speed, the ratio of stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue peaked in fiscal '24, will follow by more than a percentage point in fiscal '25 and will be below 10% over time. Free cash flow for the quarter was $199 million. This benefited from some channel partners in Western Europe booking business earlier in the quarter ahead of the transition to the new transaction model really to derisk month one after the transition. This accelerated free cash flow to the third quarter, which was partially offset by the expected negative impact of co-terming in Western Europe. Turning now to capital allocation. We continue to actively manage capital within our framework and deploy it with discipline and focus through the economic cycle to drive long-term shareholder value. As expected, the pace of buybacks picked up in the third quarter. We purchased approximately 1.2 million shares for $319 million at an average price of approximately $269 per share. We will continue to deploy capital to offset and buy forward dilution as our free cash flow grows from the fiscal '24 trough. This practice has reduced our share count by about 5 million shares over the last three years with an average percentage reduction of about 70 basis points per year. We increased the amount authorized under our share repurchase program by $5 billion for a total of approximately $9 billion. This expands our flexibility over the medium term with the precise trajectory remaining dependent on our debt repayment schedule as well as, the ebbs and flow of M&A. Now let me finish with guidance. As we said in the February, the pace of the rollout of the new transaction model will create noise in billings and the P&L. So, we think free cash flow is the best measure of our performance. Taking out that noise, the underlying momentum in the business remains consistent with the expectations embedded in our guidance range for the full year with continued strong renewal rates and headwinds to new business growth. Our sustained momentum in the third quarter and smooth launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe, reduced the likelihood of our more cautious forecast scenario. Given that, we're raising the midpoint of our billing, revenue, margin, earnings per share and free cash flow guidance ranges. So, let me give you a little bit more detail. The underlying momentum of billing is in line with our expectations. Compared to our modeling at the start of the year, the launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe in Q3 and early renewals have been a tailwind for billings, whereas more co-terming, more business done under the old buy-sell model before the launch of the new transaction model and in recent weeks, FX movement have been headwinds for billing. We now estimate that the new transaction model will provide between a 5 and 5.5 percentage point tailwind to billings growth in fiscal '25. We've raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 billings guidance by $10 million to a range of $5.90 billion to $5.98 billion. The underlying momentum of revenue is also in line with our expectations. We estimate the new transaction model will provide around 1 to 1.5 percentage point tailwind to revenue growth in fiscal '25. Upfront revenue contributed 2 percentage points to revenue growth in Q4 of fiscal '24, and therefore, this is a headwind in Q4 of fiscal '25. While not large enough to call out at the start of the year, it was already factored into our Q4 and our full year model. We've raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 revenue guidance range by $18 million to a range of $6.12 billion to $6.13 billion. We're increasing our GAAP and non-GAAP margin guidance midpoint by 25 basis points by raising the bottom end of the ranges by 50 basis points. The GAAP margin guidance range is now 21.5% to 22%. The non-GAAP margin guidance range is now 35.5% to 36%, which includes a 1 to 1.5 percentage point underlying margin improvement, broadly offset by the margin headwinds from the new transaction model and the related incremental investments in people, processes and automation. The underlying momentum of free cash flow is also in line with our expectations. The headwind to billings from co-terming and FX rates that I mentioned earlier, is being offset by early renewals, faster collections and improved underlying margins. We raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 free cash flow guidance by $10 million and tightened the range to $1.47 billion to $1.5 billion. We expect strong free cash flow growth in fiscal '26 because of the return of our largest multiyear renewal cohort the natural mechanical stacking of multiyear contracts billed annually and a larger EBA cohort. With our current trajectory, we still estimate free cash flow in fiscal '26 to be around $2.05 billion at the midpoint. The slide deck on our website has more details on modeling assumptions for Q3 and for the full fiscal year '25. And while this may be my last earnings call for Autodesk, I will stick around for a bit to ensure a smooth transition to Janesh. Thank you, Andrew, and everyone at Autodesk for your support while I was here and to the many investors and the analysts with whom I've had lively discussions over the last few quarters. While the transition to annual billings for multiyear contracts and the deployment of the new transaction model has created noise and billings in the P&L, they do provide a natural near-term tailwind to revenue and free cash flow growth. Combined with a resilient business model, sustained competitive momentum, Autodesk has enviable sources of visibility and certainty to very uncertain world. For all these reasons, I stepped down from my role as interim CFO with tremendous optimism for the future. Andrew, back to you. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Betsy. Let me finish by updating you on our strong progress in the third quarter. We continue to see good momentum in AEC, particularly in infrastructure and construction, fueled by customers consolidating onto our solutions to connect and optimize previously siloed workflows through the cloud. The cornerstone of that growing interest is our comprehensive end-to-end solutions in completing designs, preconstruction, field execution through handover and into operations. This breadth of connected capability enables us to extend our footprint further into infrastructure and construction and also expand our reach into the mid-market. As a sign of our growing momentum as the benefits of our end-to-end solution become more apparent, our construction business continue to perform robustly with net new customers doubling year over year and existing customers' renewal and expansion rates remaining strong. Let me give you a few examples. Power Construction is No. 79 on the Engineering News Record, ENR Top 400 U.S. contractor list. It is a Chicago-based general contractor serving residential and nonresidential end markets. After completing a competitive RFP to replace its legacy project management tool, Power selected Autodesk for its unified construction platform across preconstruction, construction, and DDC. By standardizing on Autodesk Construction Cloud, Power will have a single source of truth for project data, enhanced collaboration capabilities, and streamlined workflows on a single platform. Power Construction was one of two ENR 400 top 100 U.S. contractors that standardized enterprisewide on Autodesk build during the quarter. In Europe, Bouygues, a top 10 ENR 250 international contractor based in France and a leader in sustainable building and infrastructure projects renewed and expanded its EBA in the quarter. Bouygues is continuing to consolidate on Autodesk solutions across the enterprise, including broader adoption of Autodesk Forma, Carbon Insight, and Informed Design to digitize, decarbonize, and industrialize projects. It also significantly increased its commitment to Autodesk Construction Cloud to drive efficiency gains and faster bid response times through better collaboration between design and project teams. Surbana Jurong is No. 23 on ENR's top 225 international design firms. Based in Singapore, it is an urban infrastructure and integrated solutions consulting firm. In Q3, it renewed its third EBA, which included increased investment in Autodesk Construction Cloud and Autodesk Water infrastructure solutions. ACC is helping to scale its operations through increased automation, integrated design workflows and enhanced collaboration across time zones. Our water infrastructure solutions will be a core technology supporting its growth ambitions in planning, designing, engineering and managing water projects for customers worldwide. Again, these stories have a common theme. Managing people, processes and data across the project life cycle to increase efficiency and sustainability while decreasing risk. Over time, we expect the majority of all projects to be managed this way, and we remain focused on enabling that transition through our industry cloud. Moving on to manufacturing. We made excellent progress on our strategic initiatives. Customers continue to invest in their digital transformation and consolidate our Design and Make platform. Fusion remains one of the fastest-growing products in the manufacturing industry. As customers seek to drive innovation and growth at lower cost, Fusion extension attach rates are increasing, which is helping to drive the average sales price higher. For example, in the quarter, a global manufacturer supplying the semiconductor industry selected Fusion Manage and Vault PLM over competitive solutions to foster greater collaboration across manufacturing sites and improve operating efficiency. Once fully scaled and operational, this customer expects to save 105,000 hours per year by connecting people and data, resulting in reduced product development costs and faster time to market. In the U.K., Playdale Playground has been designing, manufacturing, and installing outdoor playground equipment for over 40 years. This quarter, Playdale added Fusion to its existing portfolio of Autodesk solutions, including Inventor, AutoCAD, and Vault to streamline and digitize workflows, optimize production to reduce lead times, reduce nonconformities, and replace inefficient Excel-driven operations on the shop floor. A long time Autodesk customer and global leader in precision engineering solutions renewed and expanded its EBA in the quarter. In addition to Inventor, vault and AutoCAD, it is adopting Fusion's generative design capabilities for material waste reduction and fluid flow optimization and Moldflow to reduce manufacturing costs and defects while increasing mold yields. In education, universities continue to modernize their courses and curriculum to attract and prepare future engineers. For example, from this winter, students at the University of Stuttgart, Institute for Medical Device Technology will use Fusion across six courses. Fusion was selected to replace a competitive solution for its modern platform, ease of use, cloud collaboration capabilities and unique combination of PCB and additive manufacturing workflows in a single team environment. And lastly, we continue to work with our customers to ensure they are using the latest and most secure versions of our software. For example, after a period of rapid scaling and diversification, a large multinational manufacturing company in APAC was looking to align compliance rates across its global employee base. Working collaboratively we address compliance issues while cementing a long-term partnership and completing one of our largest ever license compliance agreements, which included expanded adoption of Alias and VRED for the Design Studio and PDMC for mechanical engineering and rail design. Attractive long-term secular growth markets, a focused strategy delivering ever more valuable and connected solutions to our customers and a resilient business are generating strong and sustained momentum both in absolute terms and relative to peers. Disciplined execution and capital deployment is driving an even greater operational velocity and efficiency within Autodesk, and we continue to deploy capital to deliver sustainable shareholder value over many years. I retain a tremendous sense of purpose and optimism in the ingenuity and persistence of our customers and for the future. Operator, we would now like to open the call up for questions. Questions & Answers: Operator Thank you. [Operator instructions] Again, please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Jason Celino of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your question, please. Jason Celino -- Analyst Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Just two for me. The first one, Andrew. Some of us are unfamiliar with Janesh. Can you just tell us a little bit more about him and what he brings to Autodesk? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director I certainly can. Before I do that, let me make sure that I thank Betsy for everything she brought to Autodesk during this interim period. I really appreciate it. The company appreciates it. Thank you, Betsy. Now we're really excited about Janesh. Let me tell you why we're excited about Janesh. As you remember, one of the things I was telling you that I was looking for was someone that was going to be able to dispassionately drive optimization at scale inside of Autodesk. And what that really means is someone that's going to be really inwardly focused, looking at every dollar that we invest and making sure that we're getting the most return for the business that investors are getting the best return from their business. The next kind of criteria we were looking for, which was nice to have was, time in the seat as a sitting CFO, which was important for us as well. But it was kind of the next nice to have after the optimization at scale. Janesh brings a great balance of both of those things, right? He's been in the seat seven years at Elastic, both CFO and COO, driving some fairly turbulent changes inside of Elastic. So, he's got battle stars from pushing inside the company to get changes done inside, and we like that. We like that a lot. He's also got very good early experience at companies that we feel have always added value to Autodesk. So, he was it VMware in a senior position. He was at Cisco in a senior position. We've had good success bringing people from those kind of companies. He worked at those companies driving optimization at scale, which is the No. 1 criteria I was looking for when we we're driving this work. He also has another nice to have. He's got knowledge of our industry. He spent two years at PTC in his career. He was actually recently on the PTC board. So, he understands our industry, and he'll be able to get up to speed pretty quickly. The No. 1 goal here drive optimization and scale over the next few years, make sure that we're getting everything we need from every dollar we invest, which is a very important theme for Autodesk. And with that, I'm really excited, and I'm looking forward to him joining in December. Jason Celino -- Analyst OK. Great. Interesting. And then for my second question, now that you do have a CFO, do you have any thoughts on when you might hold the next Investor Day? I think in the past, you usually did it in March. Is that a good time frame? Or is that too soon? Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. Well, Janesh is joining in December. I think we need to give him time to get his sea legs on giving time to kind of drive the end of the year and actually get us set up for next fiscal year in good stead. So, I would say it's unlikely we'll be doing anything in the spring, but we'll get back to you on that as soon as Janesh is ready to talk about those things. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Your question, please. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst Thank you. Andrew, as of the third quarter, your three-year CAGR for current RPO is about 12%. How are you thinking about the sustainability or perhaps improvement upon that CAGR or CRPO over the next number of years? When we think about the ingredients of that, it looks like over the last several years, the CAGR for your unit volume for all brands is roughly 6% to 7% in the aggregate. So, on top of that, you've had price and other ingredients, but perhaps talk about how you think you might be able to improve upon the most recent trajectory for current RPO. Then my follow-up. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Hi, Jay, this is Betsy. Let me just give you a couple of things. There's a number of things that are going on, on the headline of the CRPO number. If you first take away the headwinds and the tailwinds was broadly consistent with the second quarter. And as I mentioned in my opening commentary, early renewals and growth with -- and the new transaction model are providing a tailwind. And then there's also a headwind to CRPO growth from the declining contribution of billed and unbilled deferred revenue risk from the large multiyear EBA cohorts coming up for renewal in fiscal '26. And just as a reminder, these are the same larger cohorts we are calling out as the tailwinds to free cash flow for next year. And if you look back to fiscal '22, we saw the same dynamic ahead of the fiscal '23 renewals as well. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst OK. Since new management is part of the news this evening, could you talk about how you're thinking about the chief revenue officer position. Would it make sense perhaps to continue to have a separate CRO? Or do you think it might make more sense perhaps to combine CRO and COO? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, we're going to continue to have a separate CRO because we have various functions that work together there under the COO organization, including our IT organization, our infrastructure and all things associated. What we're looking for in our CRO is someone that understands how to continue to drive a business when you have direct engagement with the customer. So, that means someone that really understands what it takes to analyze self-service patterns, actually understand the data that comes in from the customers to help drive cross-sell and upsell while also transforming a channel from a transactionally focused extension of Autodesk to kind of a solution partner that's driving life cycle solutions for our customers. So, that's the kind of role we're looking for here. And yes, it's going to continue to be a stand-alone CRO role within the COO organization. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Borg of Stifel. Your line is open. Adam Borg -- Analyst Awesome. Thanks so much for taking the questions, and congrats to Betsy and Janesh. Maybe on the new transaction model. I know it's still early. But I was just curious, are there any learnings from those customers that are on the new model that you're seeing in terms of the adoption of Autodesk technology and the ability to find white space to better upsell and cross-sell different solutions now that you have a more direct relationship. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah, Adam, it's really early on to be able to make any kind of conclusions about that. What I can tell you is that we definitely see some shifts to some of the direct channels at Autodesk for customers that were probably just served on a very kind of arm's length kind of transactional level. But in terms of driving cross-sell and upsell, early days, early days. But if you want to get a sense for how that might evolve, we've got experience with our EBAs and our enterprise business agreements. And we've learned over the years that having that kind of relationship with the customer where we really understand their usage patterns, who they are and what they're doing, we are much more effective at driving cross-sell and upsell even when partnering with our channel partners. So, I think those kind of stand as a testament of what's possible as we move forward with completion of the new transaction model. Adam Borg -- Analyst Great. And maybe just as a quick follow-up. Just as we think about the new administration coming in, you talked about the macro being broadly consistent. Any change in tone in your conversations with the end markets in terms of optimism or their ability or willingness to expand new projects ahead of the administration? Any pause or just full steam ahead? I'm just curious, any commentary you have there from a macro perspective would be really, really helpful. Thanks so much. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director What I'll say is the things that matter to our customers are bipartisan things, all right? Our customers care about infrastructure builds out. Both parties care about infrastructure build-outs. Our customers care about domestic manufacturing in Europe, be it in the United States, both parties agree that the domestic manufacturing build-outs are important. Supply chain, independent, supply chain stability. All of these things are bipartisan issues that really affect our customers. So, regardless of the administration, I suspect the things that are important to our customers are continuing to be a focus. Adam Borg -- Analyst Thanks, again. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink of Baird. Please go ahead, Joe. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst Thank you. On the outlook for next year, $2.050 billion in free cash has, I think, been the expectation for the past year now. Within the last year, you've also seen more co-term of contracts. And I think that leads to better billings in FY '26. So, my question is, does that actually create the potential that things are better, and that's why you're qualifying now the $2.050 billion as the midpoint of possibilities. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer There's no change to how we've talked about the free cash flow guide for fiscal '26, it continues to be $2.05 billion at the mid-point. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst OK. Fair enough. And then just on the M&A environment, over recent history, Autodesk has been more in a mode of, I would say, strategic tuck-ins. I think there is actually an asset in the CFD simulation space that was announced during AU in the quarter. Is that the right approach for Autodesk, just given this point in time, all the work you've done to build out the cloud platform, the data models, and so these tuck-ins make the most sense? And if that's true, how would you maybe compare and contrast some of the larger-scale M&A that's happening with your peers in the space? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, look, consolidation in our space is inevitable. I'm not going to comment on any specific deals, but here's what I'll say. Autodesk has always been an acquisitive company, and we will be an inquisitive company when that makes both strategic and financial sense for the company. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst OK. Thank you. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Joe. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Porter of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Elizabeth. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great, thanks so much for the question. As partners are getting customers just up and running on the new transaction model, we picked up that they're spending a little bit more time than usual of time and resources with those existing customers. So, I was curious if that had any impact on new business demand kind of more recently -- and then just more broadly, any change in new business trends that you think you should call out from versus last quarter? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Elizabeth, it's Betsy. And so, just broadly speaking, we continue to see growth, but at a slower pace due to a number of factors really over the last several years, macro, COVID, exiting Russia, elections, and while a drag on the forward momentum of the business, all of that really factored into our guidance. So, I kind of just will leave it at that. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great. And then a follow-up just on billings. I understand there's a lot of volatility around the change from multiyear in the transaction model. But it looks like guidance implies a bigger step down in growth in Q4, just despite easier year-ago compare. So, hoping that you could help us unpack the balance of those headwinds and tailwinds that would drive kind of a greater downtick in growth in Q4. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, again, let me start out with just from a fiscal '25 perspective. Your billing tailwinds are going to be from the final shift to annual billings, new transaction model and early renewals. And you're going to get headwinds from co-terming and business booked ahead of the new transaction model launch and in recent weeks, some FX. So, again, I think that we've continued to perform well as we've executed through through Q3. And so, I think we feel very, very strongly about our expectations for Q4. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bhavin Shah of Deutsche Bank. Your question please, Bhavin. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Great, thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the quarter. Andrew, at university, there appeared to be a noticeable uptick in attendance and sessions geared toward owners and operators. What been driving the recent interest from the segment? How much of it is product enhancements you guys have made versus really more focusing and emphasizing from a go-to-market perspective? And how long before this segment of buyers kind of becomes more meaningful to the financials? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah, Bhavin, that's an excellent question, right. We're very interested in tackling the whole entire life cycle from design, through make, construction, manufacturing, all the way into operations. You're probably aware we have a product called Tandem. And a lot of those sessions were driven by increasing interest and increasing adoption of Tandem, which is a digital twin solution, tightly coupled to our solutions that also has a toolkit that allows people to easily connect sensor data through the digital twin solution. So, you're seeing that uptick because we're directly releasing products and capabilities that are of interest to the owner space. You can expect to see that trend continue over time, and you can expect to see us continue to talk about the owner space, continue to deliver solutions for the owner space and even APIs for the owner space. It's an area of great interest, especially when it comes not only to vertical buildings, but factories and other things that are related to that as well as, infrastructure like what we were doing with some of our water owner solutions. So, yes, owners matter. We're building software for them, and you're going to see more of that. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Super helpful there. And then, Betsy, one for you. Just in terms of the underlying improvement that we've been seeing in the margins, and I know you've called out FX and the transaction model. I know it's very early, but as you think about next year, how do we think about like the impact of FX and the transaction model to kind of the headline operating margins? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, I wish I could give you that answer, but I think that the new CFO would probably have a little bit of a problem with that. So, we'll wait till the end of February to give you more specifics on that. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Fair enough. Thanks for taking may questions. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Good try. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke of Citi. Please go ahead, Tyler. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Yeah, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I was going to ask you about a placeholder for next year's guidance, Betsy. don't want to waste a question on that, but feel free to answer. But Andrew, I wanted to kind of ask you about some of your comments you made around efficiency, especially as it relates to hiring Janesh, who you pointed out has a lot of experience at larger companies, VMware, Cisco, et cetera. Now that you're a few quarters into this transaction model rollout, you have kind of visibility better on some of the channel prior channel relationships, having that direct billing with the customer. What are some of the areas that you've identified as having that efficiency potential? And then as we think about that efficiency unlock, should we think about that as incremental to the free cash flow number you have out for next year? Or is that embedded in that already. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director So, many layers to that question. All right. First, let me kind of answer the question in a series of stages then dodge other ones, OK? So, first off, optimization is kind of a mindset at Autodesk. It's not something that that suddenly happens. I want to reemphasize that because if you look right now, this year, for example, when you look at the apples-to-apples comparison, which will be in the slide decks, are in our disclosed materials you can see that our non-GAAP margins are already hitting the targets we set for next year this year, OK? So, optimization is a mentality. You've also heard me say over and over again as the new transaction model starts to roll out, optimization of our go-to-market efforts is going to be a critical step for us and part of the optimization journey that we're on, that's going to deliver margin growth for the company for couple of years to come, OK? And I think that's important. It's a long-term driver. Now with getting into the specifics, OK? I think the specifics are probably for another time, but let me just kind of give you a sense for some of the things that are important, right? One is the drive to self-service, right? Self-service is a huge impact on how our customers will engage with us and where those customers come from, and that is value accretive to Autodesk, both on an efficiency side, from renewals and other things, but also on the revenue growth side through capturing the customers directly. The other thing I talked about is understanding the customer better, so the upsell and cross-sell. So, we're going to be able to do a lot more automation and understanding about where the opportunities are, and that's going to drive some efficiencies. And we're moving the channel partners away from this model of being the transactional players to being the solution providers and the IP providers to our customers. That's going to have all sorts of opportunities to eliminate duplication of effort and drive real cost efficiencies for the company moving forward. There's both top-line efficiencies here in revenue growth, but there's bottom line efficiencies as well through removing the redundancies and steps that just aren't necessary for the customer. You'll get a lot more clarity on that as you see us continue to move forward with this go-to-market optimization in the next year and beyond that. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Great. And then my follow-up question, Andrew, you talked about some really strong net new customer additions within the Construction Cloud, I think, doubling year over year. we also saw the Make revenue accelerate to 28% constant currency. Can you just help us understand, do you think that reacceleration is durable? And how are you sort of thinking about just your position there? What's been driving that strength in the new customer additions? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director First, let me comment on the make revenues, then I'm going to go into construction. So, the make revenue also includes some revenue from PIX and things associated with that. However, let's talk about the facts around our construction business because I think this is important, right? No. 1 factor is that we continue to drive consistent, high growth in our construction solutions. You're seeing it. It's built into the Make numbers, and it's the lion's share of those Make numbers. You're really seeing some consistent growth there. That's organically. Inorganically, we're actually executing incredibly well on things like Payapps, and that's driving acceleration of our growth. So, we are not decelerating as a business, OK? We are actually performing solidly inorganically, we're accelerating, all right? And I just want to be really clear about that. And yes, we said year over year, we drove a 2x increase in our new customers. And I'll talk about where some of that's coming from in just a minute. But I also want to highlight the other thing that's going on we are strengthening an already strong position in the ENR 400. So, you heard about the story about power construction, which was a great example of someone taking out a competitive RFP and say, look, I need a forward-looking cloud-based solution on new technology that goes end to end from design to construction all the way to operations. And they chose us. And that was just one example that we gave in the opening commentary. So, already a strengthening position in the ENR 400. Now the other qualitative things that are driving some of that new customer growth is we already have our distribution channel operating at scale. In the U.S., this is helping us go down market more effectively, which is allowing us to capture more customers more effectively be places where we weren't before and where others aren't, which is part of driving that. But also, we're already at scale operating internationally with our distribution channel. So, that's driving international growth for us. And that's a really important driver as well as, some of those net new accounts that you're seeing there. And the last thing I'll add that I'm done with construction is that, look, I heard this over and over again at AU, I'm hearing it over and over again from customers in lots of different places. They want the end-to-end solution. They want the licensed version in the cloud, they're placing bets for the next 10 years. They want to go from design to construction to operations, and that's just making our solution more attractive to the market. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo. Your question, please. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Hey, thanks very much. I appreciate you taking the questions. A commentary on the call sounded consistent, but wondering if there are any added details you can provide for us on just the overall macro spend environment and how that's maybe progressing across either key product segments or geos, whatever split you think is more useful. I think what we're trying to get a sense for is if there are any shades of improvement anywhere or if you'd characterize as mainly just consistent over the past couple of quarters. Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Michael, I think the core answer here is consistency, OK? We're seeing consistent trends that we've seen with -- in all the other quarters. There's always puts and takes in a large business like ours, especially ones as divers as ours. But the general tone is consistent with prior quarters. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer And I would just add that there's also been a lot of noise this year from the new transaction model and then obviously, the elections and leading up to that. And so, it's hard to sparse out kind of that particular behavior. So, I think as Andrew said, we call it consistent. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Yeah, tough for us, too. That's why we keep asking. Betsy, congrats on the transition back given you're also on the board. I think it'd be useful to hear you chime in on the hiring of Janesh and maybe just also comment on how you ensure you're able to hand over the reins and keep progress going on the key transitions the company is working through. Thanks. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Per se, I was involved in the process, which was quite extensive in the company and the recruiting of Janesh. And so, we're certainly very excited to have him on board. What I would also say is, obviously, with my experience of being on the board for 11 years as well as, my deep dive into the business over the last six months. One of the reasons I'm staying around until the end of the fiscal year, is I think I could be really helpful in that transition for Janesh. And so, I'm very much looking forward to it. And I think that we have a great finance team, and I think that he's going to fit very well, and I'm looking forward to making that happen as fast as we can. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. Your question, please, Matthew. Mike Richards -- Analyst Hey, guys. This is Mike Richards on for Matt. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could provide an update on Project Bernini and maybe how customer reception has been and where we are in developing other foundational models or just the monetization opportunity there? Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, first off, before I comment on Bernini, as you might have heard from AU, AI is embedded in everything we're doing from a bottom-up and a top-down perspective. And you also heard us talk at AU about new types of foundation models we're building that understand how certain things are done in our applications. You heard about a foundation model that's driving automated drawing creation. You heard about a foundation model that's driving automated sketch generation and sketch constraints. That kind of stuff is bottom-up innovation. Bernini more of a top-down type innovation where you're actually specifying things and trying to generate a preliminary outcome from those specifications. And what we've been doing with Bernini is we've been trying to engage with certain targeted customers to get them to participate with us in making Bernini smarter and more intelligent. It's not available commercially right now. but it's getting more intelligent. We've actually been successful in getting some customers to stand up and say, look, yes, I'd like to work with you to make this more intelligent because we need something that actually understands 3D geometry as geometry, not just in the picture or something, OK? So, that's what's going on with Bernini right now, and you should continue to see refinements and extensions of that moving forward. Now with regard to monetization, monetization, nobody knows exactly how all this is going to be monetized. But there's a few vectors here that that come into play. One, we are ahead of our competitors in this space. We intend to be ahead. We're investing to stay ahead. That increase ones competitive position in the marketplace, and that's really important. Also, you get to be able to charge for some of these incremental features in the future. When you're delivering value or a high-quality outcome as a result, you're going to charge for that outcome. How we charge for those things? Let's just play out, OK? It's still early days. But there's also monetization opportunities through licensing certain technologies for specific mature maturation for specific customers' needs, all right? And that will be another avenue. So, how these avenues play out, which one waits more, let this play out. But what you need to know about Autodesk is we're ahead. We've been ahead for a while. We were the first out there with an AI research lab that been out there for over six years. It's published 70 papers. We're right on the cutting edge of 3D design technology in AI, and we intend to stay there. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of J.P. Morgan. Your question please, Steve. Stephen Tusa -- Analyst Good evening or afternoon. Lots of good questions asked. Just a detailed one. What's the change in the billings contribution from the transaction model change? The five to six to five to five and a half. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Yeah. So, it's basically because we did more buy/sell business ahead of the European launch. It's short answer. So, remember, we said 5% to 6% when we launched Europe. And it was the -- we did more buy sell business, which means there's less tailwind from the new transaction model. The flip side of -- that means that the underlying increase in our billings guidance is greater than it looks on a headline basis. Stephen Tusa -- Analyst OK, great. Thanks a lot. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Tilton of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Hey, guys, can you hear me? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Great. I have a kind of a high-level one on the incoming CFO. If I heard correctly, we didn't exactly get like an initial outlook for revenue growth for next year. And I'm just trying to understand in the context of the new CFO coming in, is there anything that could change the calculus of how you guys think about that 10% to 15% growth for the underlying business outside of the agency transition that's ongoing today. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Well, first, let's talk about that framework a little bit, and then I'll comment a little bit on the incoming CFO. So, look, the 10% to 15% growth. Right now, we're pretty much right at the bottom end of that range. And if we look back over the last two years, there's been a series of things that created headwinds to new business. It started off with things like the pandemic, the inflation, the exiting of the Russian business, the writer's strike, the whole trade wars within particular geographies. All of these things were accumulated headwinds that build slowly into the business and have pushed us down to the low end of the range. it takes time in a subscription model for those things to build out of the business, OK? So, it's going to take time for us to build out of that. That's to be expected with a subscription model. The revenue goes down slowly. It goes back up slowly as headwinds turn into tailwinds. So, expect us to be near the bottom of that range in the short term just as a general kind of guideline for the core business to be at the bottom of the range, OK? As a long-term framework, the 10% to 15% still makes sense as a long-term guide for the company. But of course, as new eyes come in, we'll look at these things, and we'll evaluate them. But right now, this all still makes sense. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Super helpful. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho. Your question, please. Siti Panigrahi -- Analyst Thanks for taking my question. I understand the new business model of some kind of noise in your expense and margin side. But if you exclude that, where do you see some of the operating leverage that you can drive in next year or so? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, I think we've actually provided kind of historically what we've done over the last three years pretty clearly. And I think we said that we continue to be focused on expansion, but nothing further to add as far as next year. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director We did provide data on that. So, you can see what underlying thing is, and we expect to see continued improvement in that same vector. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations On the same basis. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director On the same basis, on the same apples-to-apples basis. Siti Panigrahi -- Analyst OK, great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Funk of Bank of America. Your question, please. Michael Funk -- Analyst Yeah. Guys, thank you for the question tonight. Two, if I could. You've mentioned a few times in the last calls about the largest multiyear cohort renewing next year and then also a large EBA cohort. Just wondering if you can give us kind of the range of potential outcomes among the renewals there, whether a potential to upsell, risk of down sell and what that variance might look like around those renewals? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer No. I mean I think what we have said is that it's the largest cohort and we saw that performance in '23. And so, we expect a strong renewal year, but we're not giving any specific guidance on what that looks like for '26 at this point, and we'll wait until we report earnings in February. Michael Funk -- Analyst OK. Great. And then, Betsy, one more. You've mentioned a few times after the investment in new transaction model, people processes, and automation, presumably more fixed cost versus variable like commission. Can you quantify that for us to help us with modeling as we try to forecast margin? I know you've not given guidance, but better understanding of what that cost might actually be on an absolute basis would help us to think about our modeling. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Mike, we've got a slide in the earnings deck to help you think about modeling. And I'll just point you to that. Michael Funk -- Analyst OK, great. Thank you, Simon. Operator Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for Q&A today. I would now like to turn the conference back to Simon Mays-Smith for closing remarks. Sir? Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Great. Thanks, Latif, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Looking forward to seeing many of you on the road over the next few weeks. If you have any questions in the meantime, please email me or call me. And in the meantime, for those of you in North America wishing you a very happy Thanksgiving. Thank you, Latif.

seat seven year elastic, cfo coo, driving fairly turbulent change inside elastic. so, got battle star pushing inside company get change done inside, like that. like lot. also got good early experience company feel always added value autodesk. so, vmware senior position. cisco senior position. good success bringing people kind companies. worked company driving optimization scale, no. 1 criterion looking driving work. also another nice have. got knowledge industry. spent two year ptc career. actually recently ptc board. so, understands industry, able get speed pretty quickly. no. 1 goal drive optimization scale next years, make sure getting everything need every dollar invest, important theme autodesk. that, really excited, looking forward joining december. jason celino -- analyst ok. great. interesting. second question, cfo, thought might hold next investor day? think past, usually march. good time frame? soon? thanks. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah. well, janesh joining december. think need give time get sea leg giving time kind drive end year actually get u set next fiscal year good stead. so, would say unlikely anything spring, get back soon janesh ready talk things. operator thank you. next question come line jay vleeschhouwer griffin securities. question, please. jay vleeschhouwer -- analyst thank you. andrew, third quarter, three-year cagr current rpo 12%. thinking sustainability perhaps improvement upon cagr crpo next number years? think ingredient that, look like last several years, cagr unit volume brand roughly 6% 7% aggregate. so, top that, price ingredients, perhaps talk think might able improve upon recent trajectory current rpo. follow-up. betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer yeah. hi, jay, betsy. let give couple things. there's number thing going on, headline crpo number. first take away headwind tailwind broadly consistent second quarter. mentioned opening commentary, early renewal growth -- new transaction model providing tailwind. there's also headwind crpo growth declining contribution billed unbilled deferred revenue risk large multiyear eba cohort coming renewal fiscal '26. reminder, larger cohort calling tailwind free cash flow next year. look back fiscal '22, saw dynamic ahead fiscal '23 renewal well. jay vleeschhouwer -- analyst ok. since new management part news evening, could talk thinking chief revenue officer position. would make sense perhaps continue separate cro? think might make sense perhaps combine cro coo? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah. so, going continue separate cro various function work together coo organization, including organization, infrastructure thing associated. looking cro someone understands continue drive business direct engagement customer. so, mean someone really understands take analyze self-service patterns, actually understand data come customer help drive cross-sell upsell also transforming channel transactionally focused extension autodesk kind solution partner that's driving life cycle solution customers. so, that's kind role looking here. yes, going continue stand-alone cro role within coo organization. jay vleeschhouwer -- analyst thank much. operator thank you. next question come line adam borg stifel. line open. adam borg -- analyst awesome. thanks much taking questions, congrats betsy janesh. maybe new transaction model. know still early. curious, learning customer new model seeing term adoption autodesk technology ability find white space better upsell cross-sell different solution direct relationship. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah, adam, really early able make kind conclusion that. tell definitely see shift direct channel autodesk customer probably served kind arm's length kind transactional level. term driving cross-sell upsell, early days, early days. want get sense might evolve, got experience ebas enterprise business agreements. learned year kind relationship customer really understand usage patterns, doing, much effective driving cross-sell upsell even partnering channel partners. so, think kind stand testament what's possible move forward completion new transaction model. adam borg -- analyst great. maybe quick follow-up. think new administration coming in, talked macro broadly consistent. change tone conversation end market term optimism ability willingness expand new project ahead administration? pause full steam ahead? curious, commentary macro perspective would really, really helpful. thanks much. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director say thing matter customer bipartisan things, right? customer care infrastructure build out. party care infrastructure build-outs. customer care domestic manufacturing europe, united states, party agree domestic manufacturing build-outs important. supply chain, independent, supply chain stability. thing bipartisan issue really affect customers. so, regardless administration, suspect thing important customer continuing focus. adam borg -- analyst thanks, again. operator thank you. next question come line joe vruwink baird. please go ahead, joe. joe vruwink -- analyst thank you. outlook next year, $2.050 billion free cash has, think, expectation past year now. within last year, also seen co-term contracts. think lead better billing fy '26. so, question is, actually create potential thing better, that's qualifying $2.050 billion midpoint possibilities. betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer there's change talked free cash flow guide fiscal '26, continues $2.05 billion mid-point. joe vruwink -- analyst ok. fair enough. m&a environment, recent history, autodesk mode of, would say, strategic tuck-ins. think actually asset cfd simulation space announced au quarter. right approach autodesk, given point time, work done build cloud platform, data models, tuck-ins make sense? that's true, would maybe compare contrast larger-scale m&a that's happening peer space? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah. so, look, consolidation space inevitable. going comment specific deals, here's say. autodesk always acquisitive company, inquisitive company make strategic financial sense company. joe vruwink -- analyst ok. thank you. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director thank you, joe. operator thank you. next question come line elizabeth porter morgan stanley. please go ahead, elizabeth. elizabeth porter -- analyst great, thanks much question. partner getting customer running new transaction model, picked spending little bit time usual time resource existing customers. so, curious impact new business demand kind recently -- broadly, change new business trend think call versus last quarter? betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer yeah. elizabeth, betsy. so, broadly speaking, continue see growth, slower pace due number factor really last several years, macro, covid, exiting russia, elections, drag forward momentum business, really factored guidance. so, kind leave that. elizabeth porter -- analyst great. follow-up billings. understand there's lot volatility around change multiyear transaction model. look like guidance implies bigger step growth q4, despite easier year-ago compare. so, hoping could help u unpack balance headwind tailwind would drive kind greater downtick growth q4. betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer well, again, let start fiscal '25 perspective. billing tailwind going final shift annual billings, new transaction model early renewals. going get headwind co-terming business booked ahead new transaction model launch recent weeks, fx. so, again, think continued perform well executed q3. so, think feel very, strongly expectation q4. elizabeth porter -- analyst great. thank you. operator thank you. next question come line bhavin shah deutsche bank. question please, bhavin. bhavin shah -- analyst great, thanks taking question, congrats quarter. andrew, university, appeared noticeable uptick attendance session geared toward owner operators. driving recent interest segment? much product enhancement guy made versus really focusing emphasizing go-to-market perspective? long segment buyer kind becomes meaningful financials? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah, bhavin, that's excellent question, right. interested tackling whole entire life cycle design, make, construction, manufacturing, way operations. probably aware product called tandem. lot session driven increasing interest increasing adoption tandem, digital twin solution, tightly coupled solution also toolkit allows people easily connect sensor data digital twin solution. so, seeing uptick directly releasing product capability interest owner space. expect see trend continue time, expect see u continue talk owner space, continue deliver solution owner space even apis owner space. area great interest, especially come vertical buildings, factory thing related well as, infrastructure like water owner solutions. so, yes, owner matter. building software them, going see that. bhavin shah -- analyst super helpful there. then, betsy, one you. term underlying improvement seeing margins, know called fx transaction model. know early, think next year, think like impact fx transaction model kind headline operating margins? betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer well, wish could give answer, think new cfo would probably little bit problem that. so, wait till end february give specific that. bhavin shah -- analyst fair enough. thanks taking may questions. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director good try. operator thank you. next question come line tyler radke citi. please go ahead, tyler. tyler radke -- analyst yeah, good afternoon. thanks taking questions. going ask placeholder next year's guidance, betsy. want waste question that, feel free answer. andrew, wanted kind ask comment made around efficiency, especially relates hiring janesh, pointed lot experience larger companies, vmware, cisco, et cetera. quarter transaction model rollout, kind visibility better channel prior channel relationships, direct billing customer. area identified efficiency potential? think efficiency unlock, think incremental free cash flow number next year? embedded already. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director so, many layer question. right. first, let kind answer question series stage dodge ones, ok? so, first off, optimization kind mindset autodesk. something suddenly happens. want reemphasize look right now, year, example, look apples-to-apples comparison, slide decks, disclosed material see non-gaap margin already hitting target set next year year, ok? so, optimization mentality. also heard say new transaction model start roll out, optimization go-to-market effort going critical step u part optimization journey on, that's going deliver margin growth company couple year come, ok? think that's important. long-term driver. getting specifics, ok? think specific probably another time, let kind give sense thing important, right? one drive self-service, right? self-service huge impact customer engage u customer come from, value accretive autodesk, efficiency side, renewal things, also revenue growth side capturing customer directly. thing talked understanding customer better, upsell cross-sell. so, going able lot automation understanding opportunity are, that's going drive efficiencies. moving channel partner away model transactional player solution provider ip provider customers. that's going sort opportunity eliminate duplication effort drive real cost efficiency company moving forward. there's top-line efficiency revenue growth, there's bottom line efficiency well removing redundancy step necessary customer. get lot clarity see u continue move forward go-to-market optimization next year beyond that. tyler radke -- analyst great. follow-up question, andrew, talked really strong net new customer addition within construction cloud, think, doubling year year. also saw make revenue accelerate 28% constant currency. help u understand, think reacceleration durable? sort thinking position there? what's driving strength new customer additions? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director first, let comment make revenues, going go construction. so, make revenue also includes revenue pix thing associated that. however, let's talk fact around construction business think important, right? no. 1 factor continue drive consistent, high growth construction solutions. seeing it. built make numbers, lion's share make numbers. really seeing consistent growth there. that's organically. inorganically, actually executing incredibly well thing like payapps, that's driving acceleration growth. so, decelerating business, ok? actually performing solidly inorganically, accelerating, right? want really clear that. yes, said year year, drove 2x increase new customers. talk that's coming minute. also want highlight thing that's going strengthening already strong position enr 400. so, heard story power construction, great example someone taking competitive rfp say, look, need forward-looking cloud-based solution new technology go end end design construction way operations. chose us. one example gave opening commentary. so, already strengthening position enr 400. qualitative thing driving new customer growth already distribution channel operating scale. u.s., helping u go market effectively, allowing u capture customer effectively place others aren't, part driving that. also, already scale operating internationally distribution channel. so, that's driving international growth us. that's really important driver well as, net new account seeing there. last thing add done construction that, look, heard au, hearing customer lot different places. want end-to-end solution. want licensed version cloud, placing bet next 10 years. want go design construction operations, that's making solution attractive market. operator thank you. next question come line michael turrin well fargo. question, please. michael turrin -- analyst hey, thanks much. appreciate taking questions. commentary call sounded consistent, wondering added detail provide u overall macro spend environment that's maybe progressing across either key product segment geos, whatever split think useful. think trying get sense shade improvement anywhere characterize mainly consistent past couple quarters. thanks. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director michael, think core answer consistency, ok? seeing consistent trend seen -- quarters. there's always put take large business like ours, especially one diver ours. general tone consistent prior quarters. betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer would add there's also lot noise year new transaction model obviously, election leading that. so, hard sparse kind particular behavior. so, think andrew said, call consistent. michael turrin -- analyst yeah, tough us, too. that's keep asking. betsy, congrats transition back given also board. think useful hear chime hiring janesh maybe also comment ensure able hand rein keep progress going key transition company working through. thanks. betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer per se, involved process, quite extensive company recruiting janesh. so, certainly excited board. would also say is, obviously, experience board 11 year well as, deep dive business last six months. one reason staying around end fiscal year, think could really helpful transition janesh. so, much looking forward it. think great finance team, think going fit well, looking forward making happen fast can. michael turrin -- analyst thank you. operator thank you. next question come line matthew hedberg rbc capital markets. question, please, matthew. mike richards -- analyst hey, guys. mike richards matt. thanks taking question. wondering could provide update project bernini maybe customer reception developing foundational model monetization opportunity there?

so, that's what's going bernini right now, continue see refinement extension moving forward. regard monetization, monetization, nobody know exactly going monetized. there's vector come play. one, ahead competitor space. intend ahead. investing stay ahead. increase one competitive position marketplace, that's really important. also, get able charge incremental feature future. delivering value high-quality outcome result, going charge outcome. charge things? let's play out, ok? still early days. there's also monetization opportunity licensing certain technology specific mature maturation specific customers' needs, right? another avenue. so, avenue play out, one wait more, let play out. need know autodesk ahead. ahead while. first ai research lab six years. published 70 papers. right cutting edge 3d design technology ai, intend stay there. operator thank you. next question come line steve tusa j.p. morgan. question please, steve. stephen tusa -- analyst good evening afternoon. lot good question asked. detailed one. what's change billing contribution transaction model change? five six five five half. simon mays-smith -- vice president, investor relation yeah. so, basically buy/sell business ahead european launch. short answer. so, remember, said 5% 6% launched europe. -- buy sell business, mean there's less tailwind new transaction model. flip side -- mean underlying increase billing guidance greater look headline basis. stephen tusa -- analyst ok, great. thanks lot. operator thank you. next question come line joshua tilton wolfe research. line open. joshua tilton -- analyst hey, guys, hear me? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah. joshua tilton -- analyst great. kind high-level one incoming cfo. heard correctly, exactly get like initial outlook revenue growth next year. trying understand context new cfo coming in, anything could change calculus guy think 10% 15% growth underlying business outside agency transition that's ongoing today. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director well, first, let's talk framework little bit, comment little bit incoming cfo. so, look, 10% 15% growth. right now, pretty much right bottom end range. look back last two years, there's series thing created headwind new business. started thing like pandemic, inflation, exiting russian business, writer's strike, whole trade war within particular geographies. thing accumulated headwind build slowly business pushed u low end range. take time subscription model thing build business, ok? so, going take time u build that. that's expected subscription model. revenue go slowly. go back slowly headwind turn tailwinds. so, expect u near bottom range short term general kind guideline core business bottom range, ok? long-term framework, 10% 15% still make sense long-term guide company. course, new eye come in, look things, evaluate them. right now, still make sense. joshua tilton -- analyst super helpful. operator thank you. next question come line siti panigrahi mizuho. question, please. siti panigrahi -- analyst thanks taking question. understand new business model kind noise expense margin side. exclude that, see operating leverage drive next year so? betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer well, think actually provided kind historically done last three year pretty clearly. think said continue focused expansion, nothing add far next year. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director provide data that. so, see underlying thing is, expect see continued improvement vector. simon mays-smith -- vice president, investor relation basis. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director basis, apples-to-apples basis. siti panigrahi -- analyst ok, great. thank you. operator thank you. next question come line michael funk bank america. question, please. michael funk -- analyst yeah. guys, thank question tonight. two, could. mentioned time last call largest multiyear cohort renewing next year also large eba cohort. wondering give u kind range potential outcome among renewal there, whether potential upsell, risk sell variance might look like around renewals? betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer no. mean think said largest cohort saw performance '23. so, expect strong renewal year, giving specific guidance look like '26 point, wait report earnings february. michael funk -- analyst ok. great. then, betsy, one more. mentioned time investment new transaction model, people processes, automation, presumably fixed cost versus variable like commission. quantify u help u modeling try forecast margin?

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Simon Mays-Smith, VP, investor relations. Please go ahead. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Thanks, operator, and good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the third quarter results of Autodesk's fiscal '25. On the line with me is Andrew Anagnost, our CEO; and Betsy Rafael, our interim CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including outlook and related assumptions and on product and strategies. Actual events or results could differ materially. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-Q and the Form 8-K filed with today's press release for important risks and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today. If this call is replayed or reviewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Autodesk disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will quote several numeric or growth changes during this call as we discuss our financial performance. Unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison. All non-GAAP numbers referenced in today's call are reconciled in our press release or Excel financials and other supplemental materials available on our Investor Relations website. And now, I will turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Simon, and welcome, everyone, to the call. We finished the third quarter of the year strongly, delivering 12% revenue growth in constant currency and have again raised full year guidance. This reflects the sustained momentum of the business and successful execution of our strategy, including a smooth implementation of the new transaction model in Western Europe. Once again, opportunity, resilience and discipline underpinned our performance. Last month at Autodesk University in San Diego, we hosted 12,000 registered attendees and another 30,000 online. We showed how granular data in the cloud, organized the data models and connected to everything through APIs to deliver even more valuable and connected solutions for customers and partners and support a much broader ecosystem and marketplace. Customers and channel partners that I spoke with at AU remain cautiously optimistic, a sentiment consistent with the underlying momentum of our business, our growing product usage and BuildingConnected bid activity trends over recent quarters. I left AU with a tremendous sense of purpose and optimism in the ingenuity and persistence of our customers and for the future. On our earnings call last quarter, I set out our secular growth opportunities and our strategy to capitalize on them. I concluded that Autodesk's investment in cloud, platform and AI in pursuit of those opportunities were ahead of its peers. AU was a good demonstration of that. But we're also leading the industry in modernizing our go-to-market motion starting a few years ago with the subscription transition through consumption and self-service enablement and more recently to direct billing. These initiatives enable Autodesk to build larger and more durable direct relationships with its customers and to serve them more efficiently. We have already seen significant benefits from initiatives like these, and there's more to come in the next optimization phase. Taking out the effects on margins from FX and the new transaction model, we still expect to be toward the midpoint of our fiscal '26 non-GAAP operating margin target of 38% to 40% in fiscal '25, a year ahead of schedule. We're confident we will make further improvement in fiscal '26 on the same basis. The new transaction model will enable tighter channel partnerships with less duplication of effort and more digital self-service and automation, which increases customer satisfaction and workforce productivity. It will also create new opportunities for partners Autodesk to earn more with less emphasis on transaction revenue sharing and a greater emphasis on value creation for customers. Once complete, we expect the new transaction model and subsequent go-to-market optimization to increase sales and marketing efficiency and deliver GAAP margins among the best in the industry. Attractive, long-term, secular growth markets, a focused strategy delivering ever more valuable and connected solutions to our customers, and a resilient business are generating strong and sustained momentum, both in absolute terms and relative to peers. Disciplined execution and capital deployment has driven even greater operational velocity and efficiency within Autodesk and will underpin the mechanical build of revenue and free cash flow over the next few years and GAAP margins among the best in the industry. We will continue to deploy capital to offset and buy forward dilution as our free cash flow grows from the fiscal '24 trough. This practice has reduced our share count over the last three years. We have significantly increased our share repurchase authorization to extend this momentum flexibility over the medium term, with the precise trajectory remaining dependent on our debt repayment schedule and the ebb and flow of M&A. In combination, we believe these factors will deliver sustainable shareholder value over many years. Before I conclude, I'd like to formally welcome Janesh to Autodesk. We're excited to welcome Janesh, who brings a wealth of experience and will be instrumental in sustaining Autodesk's growth and enhanced profitability momentum. Of equal importance, I'd like to thank Betsy for stepping in as interim CFO at an important time in the company's journey, and I'm looking forward to continuing to work closely with her as an Autodesk Board member. I will now turn the call over to Betsy to discuss our quarterly financial performance and guidance for the year. I'll then return to provide an update on our strategic growth initiatives. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Andrew. Q3 was another strong quarter. We generated broad-based underlying growth across products and regions. In addition, we saw revenue increases from the new transaction model and M&A which were offset by the absence of enterprise business agreement true-ups from Q3 last year and FX. Our Make products continued to enhance growth, driven by our ongoing strength in construction and Fusion. Overall, macroeconomic policy and geopolitical challenges and the underlying momentum of the business were consistent with the last few quarters, with continued strong renewal rates and headwinds to our new business growth. Total revenue grew 11% and 12% in constant currency. By product, in constant currency, AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT revenue grew 8%. AEC revenue, which was most impacted by the absence of true-up revenues, grew 12%, Manufacturing revenue grew 16% and still comfortably in double digits, excluding upfront revenue. And M&E revenue grew 15% boosted by the PIX acquisition and associated integration adjustments. By region, in constant currency, revenue grew 11% in the Americas which was most impacted by the absence of true-up revenues, 13% in EMEA and 14% in APAC. The mechanical contribution from the new transaction model to revenue was $17 million in the third quarter and $25 million on a year-to-date basis. Direct revenue increased 23% and represented 42% of total revenue, up 4 percentage points from last year, benefiting from strong growth in both EBAs and the Autodesk store and also the natural tailwind to revenue from the new transaction model. Net revenue retention rate remained within the 100% to 110% range at constant exchange rates. Billings increased 28% in the quarter, reflecting a tailwind from the prior-year shift to annual billings for most multiyear contracts, early renewals and the natural tailwind from the transition to the new transaction model. Similar to last quarter, and as expected, co-terming negatively impacted billing ahead of the launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe. The natural contribution from the new transaction model to billing was $72 million in the third quarter and $108 million on a year-to-date basis. Total deferred revenue decreased 9% to $3.7 billion and was again impacted by the transition from upfront to annual billings for multiyear contracts. Total RPO of $6.1 billion and current RPO of $4.0 billion grew 17% and 14%, respectively, which reflects a tailwind from early renewals and the new transaction model and a headwind from the declining contribution of billed and unbilled deferred revenue from large, multiyear and EBA cohorts ahead of renewal in fiscal '26. Excluding these, current RPO growth was broadly consistent with Q2. We do expect the new transaction model and the larger FY '26 renewal cohorts to have a greater impact on both RPO and current RPO growth in Q4 of fiscal '25. Turning to margins. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were broadly low. With Autodesk University shifting back to Q3 this year from Q4 last year, GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins decreased by 2 and 3 percentage points, respectively. The timing effect from AU obviously washes out over the full year. At current course and speed, the ratio of stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue peaked in fiscal '24, will follow by more than a percentage point in fiscal '25 and will be below 10% over time. Free cash flow for the quarter was $199 million. This benefited from some channel partners in Western Europe booking business earlier in the quarter ahead of the transition to the new transaction model really to derisk month one after the transition. This accelerated free cash flow to the third quarter, which was partially offset by the expected negative impact of co-terming in Western Europe. Turning now to capital allocation. We continue to actively manage capital within our framework and deploy it with discipline and focus through the economic cycle to drive long-term shareholder value. As expected, the pace of buybacks picked up in the third quarter. We purchased approximately 1.2 million shares for $319 million at an average price of approximately $269 per share. We will continue to deploy capital to offset and buy forward dilution as our free cash flow grows from the fiscal '24 trough. This practice has reduced our share count by about 5 million shares over the last three years with an average percentage reduction of about 70 basis points per year. We increased the amount authorized under our share repurchase program by $5 billion for a total of approximately $9 billion. This expands our flexibility over the medium term with the precise trajectory remaining dependent on our debt repayment schedule as well as, the ebbs and flow of M&A. Now let me finish with guidance. As we said in the February, the pace of the rollout of the new transaction model will create noise in billings and the P&L. So, we think free cash flow is the best measure of our performance. Taking out that noise, the underlying momentum in the business remains consistent with the expectations embedded in our guidance range for the full year with continued strong renewal rates and headwinds to new business growth. Our sustained momentum in the third quarter and smooth launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe, reduced the likelihood of our more cautious forecast scenario. Given that, we're raising the midpoint of our billing, revenue, margin, earnings per share and free cash flow guidance ranges. So, let me give you a little bit more detail. The underlying momentum of billing is in line with our expectations. Compared to our modeling at the start of the year, the launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe in Q3 and early renewals have been a tailwind for billings, whereas more co-terming, more business done under the old buy-sell model before the launch of the new transaction model and in recent weeks, FX movement have been headwinds for billing. We now estimate that the new transaction model will provide between a 5 and 5.5 percentage point tailwind to billings growth in fiscal '25. We've raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 billings guidance by $10 million to a range of $5.90 billion to $5.98 billion. The underlying momentum of revenue is also in line with our expectations. We estimate the new transaction model will provide around 1 to 1.5 percentage point tailwind to revenue growth in fiscal '25. Upfront revenue contributed 2 percentage points to revenue growth in Q4 of fiscal '24, and therefore, this is a headwind in Q4 of fiscal '25. While not large enough to call out at the start of the year, it was already factored into our Q4 and our full year model. We've raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 revenue guidance range by $18 million to a range of $6.12 billion to $6.13 billion. We're increasing our GAAP and non-GAAP margin guidance midpoint by 25 basis points by raising the bottom end of the ranges by 50 basis points. The GAAP margin guidance range is now 21.5% to 22%. The non-GAAP margin guidance range is now 35.5% to 36%, which includes a 1 to 1.5 percentage point underlying margin improvement, broadly offset by the margin headwinds from the new transaction model and the related incremental investments in people, processes and automation. The underlying momentum of free cash flow is also in line with our expectations. The headwind to billings from co-terming and FX rates that I mentioned earlier, is being offset by early renewals, faster collections and improved underlying margins. We raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 free cash flow guidance by $10 million and tightened the range to $1.47 billion to $1.5 billion. We expect strong free cash flow growth in fiscal '26 because of the return of our largest multiyear renewal cohort the natural mechanical stacking of multiyear contracts billed annually and a larger EBA cohort. With our current trajectory, we still estimate free cash flow in fiscal '26 to be around $2.05 billion at the midpoint. The slide deck on our website has more details on modeling assumptions for Q3 and for the full fiscal year '25. And while this may be my last earnings call for Autodesk, I will stick around for a bit to ensure a smooth transition to Janesh. Thank you, Andrew, and everyone at Autodesk for your support while I was here and to the many investors and the analysts with whom I've had lively discussions over the last few quarters. While the transition to annual billings for multiyear contracts and the deployment of the new transaction model has created noise and billings in the P&L, they do provide a natural near-term tailwind to revenue and free cash flow growth. Combined with a resilient business model, sustained competitive momentum, Autodesk has enviable sources of visibility and certainty to very uncertain world. For all these reasons, I stepped down from my role as interim CFO with tremendous optimism for the future. Andrew, back to you. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Betsy. Let me finish by updating you on our strong progress in the third quarter. We continue to see good momentum in AEC, particularly in infrastructure and construction, fueled by customers consolidating onto our solutions to connect and optimize previously siloed workflows through the cloud. The cornerstone of that growing interest is our comprehensive end-to-end solutions in completing designs, preconstruction, field execution through handover and into operations. This breadth of connected capability enables us to extend our footprint further into infrastructure and construction and also expand our reach into the mid-market. As a sign of our growing momentum as the benefits of our end-to-end solution become more apparent, our construction business continue to perform robustly with net new customers doubling year over year and existing customers' renewal and expansion rates remaining strong. Let me give you a few examples. Power Construction is No. 79 on the Engineering News Record, ENR Top 400 U.S. contractor list. It is a Chicago-based general contractor serving residential and nonresidential end markets. After completing a competitive RFP to replace its legacy project management tool, Power selected Autodesk for its unified construction platform across preconstruction, construction, and DDC. By standardizing on Autodesk Construction Cloud, Power will have a single source of truth for project data, enhanced collaboration capabilities, and streamlined workflows on a single platform. Power Construction was one of two ENR 400 top 100 U.S. contractors that standardized enterprisewide on Autodesk build during the quarter. In Europe, Bouygues, a top 10 ENR 250 international contractor based in France and a leader in sustainable building and infrastructure projects renewed and expanded its EBA in the quarter. Bouygues is continuing to consolidate on Autodesk solutions across the enterprise, including broader adoption of Autodesk Forma, Carbon Insight, and Informed Design to digitize, decarbonize, and industrialize projects. It also significantly increased its commitment to Autodesk Construction Cloud to drive efficiency gains and faster bid response times through better collaboration between design and project teams. Surbana Jurong is No. 23 on ENR's top 225 international design firms. Based in Singapore, it is an urban infrastructure and integrated solutions consulting firm. In Q3, it renewed its third EBA, which included increased investment in Autodesk Construction Cloud and Autodesk Water infrastructure solutions. ACC is helping to scale its operations through increased automation, integrated design workflows and enhanced collaboration across time zones. Our water infrastructure solutions will be a core technology supporting its growth ambitions in planning, designing, engineering and managing water projects for customers worldwide. Again, these stories have a common theme. Managing people, processes and data across the project life cycle to increase efficiency and sustainability while decreasing risk. Over time, we expect the majority of all projects to be managed this way, and we remain focused on enabling that transition through our industry cloud. Moving on to manufacturing. We made excellent progress on our strategic initiatives. Customers continue to invest in their digital transformation and consolidate our Design and Make platform. Fusion remains one of the fastest-growing products in the manufacturing industry. As customers seek to drive innovation and growth at lower cost, Fusion extension attach rates are increasing, which is helping to drive the average sales price higher. For example, in the quarter, a global manufacturer supplying the semiconductor industry selected Fusion Manage and Vault PLM over competitive solutions to foster greater collaboration across manufacturing sites and improve operating efficiency. Once fully scaled and operational, this customer expects to save 105,000 hours per year by connecting people and data, resulting in reduced product development costs and faster time to market. In the U.K., Playdale Playground has been designing, manufacturing, and installing outdoor playground equipment for over 40 years. This quarter, Playdale added Fusion to its existing portfolio of Autodesk solutions, including Inventor, AutoCAD, and Vault to streamline and digitize workflows, optimize production to reduce lead times, reduce nonconformities, and replace inefficient Excel-driven operations on the shop floor. A long time Autodesk customer and global leader in precision engineering solutions renewed and expanded its EBA in the quarter. In addition to Inventor, vault and AutoCAD, it is adopting Fusion's generative design capabilities for material waste reduction and fluid flow optimization and Moldflow to reduce manufacturing costs and defects while increasing mold yields. In education, universities continue to modernize their courses and curriculum to attract and prepare future engineers. For example, from this winter, students at the University of Stuttgart, Institute for Medical Device Technology will use Fusion across six courses. Fusion was selected to replace a competitive solution for its modern platform, ease of use, cloud collaboration capabilities and unique combination of PCB and additive manufacturing workflows in a single team environment. And lastly, we continue to work with our customers to ensure they are using the latest and most secure versions of our software. For example, after a period of rapid scaling and diversification, a large multinational manufacturing company in APAC was looking to align compliance rates across its global employee base. Working collaboratively we address compliance issues while cementing a long-term partnership and completing one of our largest ever license compliance agreements, which included expanded adoption of Alias and VRED for the Design Studio and PDMC for mechanical engineering and rail design. Attractive long-term secular growth markets, a focused strategy delivering ever more valuable and connected solutions to our customers and a resilient business are generating strong and sustained momentum both in absolute terms and relative to peers. Disciplined execution and capital deployment is driving an even greater operational velocity and efficiency within Autodesk, and we continue to deploy capital to deliver sustainable shareholder value over many years. I retain a tremendous sense of purpose and optimism in the ingenuity and persistence of our customers and for the future. Operator, we would now like to open the call up for questions. Questions & Answers: Operator Thank you. [Operator instructions] Again, please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Jason Celino of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your question, please. Jason Celino -- Analyst Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Just two for me. The first one, Andrew. Some of us are unfamiliar with Janesh. Can you just tell us a little bit more about him and what he brings to Autodesk? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director I certainly can. Before I do that, let me make sure that I thank Betsy for everything she brought to Autodesk during this interim period. I really appreciate it. The company appreciates it. Thank you, Betsy. Now we're really excited about Janesh. Let me tell you why we're excited about Janesh. As you remember, one of the things I was telling you that I was looking for was someone that was going to be able to dispassionately drive optimization at scale inside of Autodesk. And what that really means is someone that's going to be really inwardly focused, looking at every dollar that we invest and making sure that we're getting the most return for the business that investors are getting the best return from their business. The next kind of criteria we were looking for, which was nice to have was, time in the seat as a sitting CFO, which was important for us as well. But it was kind of the next nice to have after the optimization at scale. Janesh brings a great balance of both of those things, right? He's been in the seat seven years at Elastic, both CFO and COO, driving some fairly turbulent changes inside of Elastic. So, he's got battle stars from pushing inside the company to get changes done inside, and we like that. We like that a lot. He's also got very good early experience at companies that we feel have always added value to Autodesk. So, he was it VMware in a senior position. He was at Cisco in a senior position. We've had good success bringing people from those kind of companies. He worked at those companies driving optimization at scale, which is the No. 1 criteria I was looking for when we we're driving this work. He also has another nice to have. He's got knowledge of our industry. He spent two years at PTC in his career. He was actually recently on the PTC board. So, he understands our industry, and he'll be able to get up to speed pretty quickly. The No. 1 goal here drive optimization and scale over the next few years, make sure that we're getting everything we need from every dollar we invest, which is a very important theme for Autodesk. And with that, I'm really excited, and I'm looking forward to him joining in December. Jason Celino -- Analyst OK. Great. Interesting. And then for my second question, now that you do have a CFO, do you have any thoughts on when you might hold the next Investor Day? I think in the past, you usually did it in March. Is that a good time frame? Or is that too soon? Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. Well, Janesh is joining in December. I think we need to give him time to get his sea legs on giving time to kind of drive the end of the year and actually get us set up for next fiscal year in good stead. So, I would say it's unlikely we'll be doing anything in the spring, but we'll get back to you on that as soon as Janesh is ready to talk about those things. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Your question, please. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst Thank you. Andrew, as of the third quarter, your three-year CAGR for current RPO is about 12%. How are you thinking about the sustainability or perhaps improvement upon that CAGR or CRPO over the next number of years? When we think about the ingredients of that, it looks like over the last several years, the CAGR for your unit volume for all brands is roughly 6% to 7% in the aggregate. So, on top of that, you've had price and other ingredients, but perhaps talk about how you think you might be able to improve upon the most recent trajectory for current RPO. Then my follow-up. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Hi, Jay, this is Betsy. Let me just give you a couple of things. There's a number of things that are going on, on the headline of the CRPO number. If you first take away the headwinds and the tailwinds was broadly consistent with the second quarter. And as I mentioned in my opening commentary, early renewals and growth with -- and the new transaction model are providing a tailwind. And then there's also a headwind to CRPO growth from the declining contribution of billed and unbilled deferred revenue risk from the large multiyear EBA cohorts coming up for renewal in fiscal '26. And just as a reminder, these are the same larger cohorts we are calling out as the tailwinds to free cash flow for next year. And if you look back to fiscal '22, we saw the same dynamic ahead of the fiscal '23 renewals as well. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst OK. Since new management is part of the news this evening, could you talk about how you're thinking about the chief revenue officer position. Would it make sense perhaps to continue to have a separate CRO? Or do you think it might make more sense perhaps to combine CRO and COO? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, we're going to continue to have a separate CRO because we have various functions that work together there under the COO organization, including our IT organization, our infrastructure and all things associated. What we're looking for in our CRO is someone that understands how to continue to drive a business when you have direct engagement with the customer. So, that means someone that really understands what it takes to analyze self-service patterns, actually understand the data that comes in from the customers to help drive cross-sell and upsell while also transforming a channel from a transactionally focused extension of Autodesk to kind of a solution partner that's driving life cycle solutions for our customers. So, that's the kind of role we're looking for here. And yes, it's going to continue to be a stand-alone CRO role within the COO organization. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Borg of Stifel. Your line is open. Adam Borg -- Analyst Awesome. Thanks so much for taking the questions, and congrats to Betsy and Janesh. Maybe on the new transaction model. I know it's still early. But I was just curious, are there any learnings from those customers that are on the new model that you're seeing in terms of the adoption of Autodesk technology and the ability to find white space to better upsell and cross-sell different solutions now that you have a more direct relationship. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah, Adam, it's really early on to be able to make any kind of conclusions about that. What I can tell you is that we definitely see some shifts to some of the direct channels at Autodesk for customers that were probably just served on a very kind of arm's length kind of transactional level. But in terms of driving cross-sell and upsell, early days, early days. But if you want to get a sense for how that might evolve, we've got experience with our EBAs and our enterprise business agreements. And we've learned over the years that having that kind of relationship with the customer where we really understand their usage patterns, who they are and what they're doing, we are much more effective at driving cross-sell and upsell even when partnering with our channel partners. So, I think those kind of stand as a testament of what's possible as we move forward with completion of the new transaction model. Adam Borg -- Analyst Great. And maybe just as a quick follow-up. Just as we think about the new administration coming in, you talked about the macro being broadly consistent. Any change in tone in your conversations with the end markets in terms of optimism or their ability or willingness to expand new projects ahead of the administration? Any pause or just full steam ahead? I'm just curious, any commentary you have there from a macro perspective would be really, really helpful. Thanks so much. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director What I'll say is the things that matter to our customers are bipartisan things, all right? Our customers care about infrastructure builds out. Both parties care about infrastructure build-outs. Our customers care about domestic manufacturing in Europe, be it in the United States, both parties agree that the domestic manufacturing build-outs are important. Supply chain, independent, supply chain stability. All of these things are bipartisan issues that really affect our customers. So, regardless of the administration, I suspect the things that are important to our customers are continuing to be a focus. Adam Borg -- Analyst Thanks, again. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink of Baird. Please go ahead, Joe. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst Thank you. On the outlook for next year, $2.050 billion in free cash has, I think, been the expectation for the past year now. Within the last year, you've also seen more co-term of contracts. And I think that leads to better billings in FY '26. So, my question is, does that actually create the potential that things are better, and that's why you're qualifying now the $2.050 billion as the midpoint of possibilities. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer There's no change to how we've talked about the free cash flow guide for fiscal '26, it continues to be $2.05 billion at the mid-point. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst OK. Fair enough. And then just on the M&A environment, over recent history, Autodesk has been more in a mode of, I would say, strategic tuck-ins. I think there is actually an asset in the CFD simulation space that was announced during AU in the quarter. Is that the right approach for Autodesk, just given this point in time, all the work you've done to build out the cloud platform, the data models, and so these tuck-ins make the most sense? And if that's true, how would you maybe compare and contrast some of the larger-scale M&A that's happening with your peers in the space? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, look, consolidation in our space is inevitable. I'm not going to comment on any specific deals, but here's what I'll say. Autodesk has always been an acquisitive company, and we will be an inquisitive company when that makes both strategic and financial sense for the company. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst OK. Thank you. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Joe. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Porter of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Elizabeth. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great, thanks so much for the question. As partners are getting customers just up and running on the new transaction model, we picked up that they're spending a little bit more time than usual of time and resources with those existing customers. So, I was curious if that had any impact on new business demand kind of more recently -- and then just more broadly, any change in new business trends that you think you should call out from versus last quarter? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Elizabeth, it's Betsy. And so, just broadly speaking, we continue to see growth, but at a slower pace due to a number of factors really over the last several years, macro, COVID, exiting Russia, elections, and while a drag on the forward momentum of the business, all of that really factored into our guidance. So, I kind of just will leave it at that. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great. And then a follow-up just on billings. I understand there's a lot of volatility around the change from multiyear in the transaction model. But it looks like guidance implies a bigger step down in growth in Q4, just despite easier year-ago compare. So, hoping that you could help us unpack the balance of those headwinds and tailwinds that would drive kind of a greater downtick in growth in Q4. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, again, let me start out with just from a fiscal '25 perspective. Your billing tailwinds are going to be from the final shift to annual billings, new transaction model and early renewals. And you're going to get headwinds from co-terming and business booked ahead of the new transaction model launch and in recent weeks, some FX. So, again, I think that we've continued to perform well as we've executed through through Q3. And so, I think we feel very, very strongly about our expectations for Q4. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bhavin Shah of Deutsche Bank. Your question please, Bhavin. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Great, thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the quarter. Andrew, at university, there appeared to be a noticeable uptick in attendance and sessions geared toward owners and operators. What been driving the recent interest from the segment? How much of it is product enhancements you guys have made versus really more focusing and emphasizing from a go-to-market perspective? And how long before this segment of buyers kind of becomes more meaningful to the financials? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah, Bhavin, that's an excellent question, right. We're very interested in tackling the whole entire life cycle from design, through make, construction, manufacturing, all the way into operations. You're probably aware we have a product called Tandem. And a lot of those sessions were driven by increasing interest and increasing adoption of Tandem, which is a digital twin solution, tightly coupled to our solutions that also has a toolkit that allows people to easily connect sensor data through the digital twin solution. So, you're seeing that uptick because we're directly releasing products and capabilities that are of interest to the owner space. You can expect to see that trend continue over time, and you can expect to see us continue to talk about the owner space, continue to deliver solutions for the owner space and even APIs for the owner space. It's an area of great interest, especially when it comes not only to vertical buildings, but factories and other things that are related to that as well as, infrastructure like what we were doing with some of our water owner solutions. So, yes, owners matter. We're building software for them, and you're going to see more of that. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Super helpful there. And then, Betsy, one for you. Just in terms of the underlying improvement that we've been seeing in the margins, and I know you've called out FX and the transaction model. I know it's very early, but as you think about next year, how do we think about like the impact of FX and the transaction model to kind of the headline operating margins? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, I wish I could give you that answer, but I think that the new CFO would probably have a little bit of a problem with that. So, we'll wait till the end of February to give you more specifics on that. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Fair enough. Thanks for taking may questions. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Good try. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke of Citi. Please go ahead, Tyler. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Yeah, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I was going to ask you about a placeholder for next year's guidance, Betsy. don't want to waste a question on that, but feel free to answer. But Andrew, I wanted to kind of ask you about some of your comments you made around efficiency, especially as it relates to hiring Janesh, who you pointed out has a lot of experience at larger companies, VMware, Cisco, et cetera. Now that you're a few quarters into this transaction model rollout, you have kind of visibility better on some of the channel prior channel relationships, having that direct billing with the customer. What are some of the areas that you've identified as having that efficiency potential? And then as we think about that efficiency unlock, should we think about that as incremental to the free cash flow number you have out for next year? Or is that embedded in that already. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director So, many layers to that question. All right. First, let me kind of answer the question in a series of stages then dodge other ones, OK? So, first off, optimization is kind of a mindset at Autodesk. It's not something that that suddenly happens. I want to reemphasize that because if you look right now, this year, for example, when you look at the apples-to-apples comparison, which will be in the slide decks, are in our disclosed materials you can see that our non-GAAP margins are already hitting the targets we set for next year this year, OK? So, optimization is a mentality. You've also heard me say over and over again as the new transaction model starts to roll out, optimization of our go-to-market efforts is going to be a critical step for us and part of the optimization journey that we're on, that's going to deliver margin growth for the company for couple of years to come, OK? And I think that's important. It's a long-term driver. Now with getting into the specifics, OK? I think the specifics are probably for another time, but let me just kind of give you a sense for some of the things that are important, right? One is the drive to self-service, right? Self-service is a huge impact on how our customers will engage with us and where those customers come from, and that is value accretive to Autodesk, both on an efficiency side, from renewals and other things, but also on the revenue growth side through capturing the customers directly. The other thing I talked about is understanding the customer better, so the upsell and cross-sell. So, we're going to be able to do a lot more automation and understanding about where the opportunities are, and that's going to drive some efficiencies. And we're moving the channel partners away from this model of being the transactional players to being the solution providers and the IP providers to our customers. That's going to have all sorts of opportunities to eliminate duplication of effort and drive real cost efficiencies for the company moving forward. There's both top-line efficiencies here in revenue growth, but there's bottom line efficiencies as well through removing the redundancies and steps that just aren't necessary for the customer. You'll get a lot more clarity on that as you see us continue to move forward with this go-to-market optimization in the next year and beyond that. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Great. And then my follow-up question, Andrew, you talked about some really strong net new customer additions within the Construction Cloud, I think, doubling year over year. we also saw the Make revenue accelerate to 28% constant currency. Can you just help us understand, do you think that reacceleration is durable? And how are you sort of thinking about just your position there? What's been driving that strength in the new customer additions? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director First, let me comment on the make revenues, then I'm going to go into construction. So, the make revenue also includes some revenue from PIX and things associated with that. However, let's talk about the facts around our construction business because I think this is important, right? No. 1 factor is that we continue to drive consistent, high growth in our construction solutions. You're seeing it. It's built into the Make numbers, and it's the lion's share of those Make numbers. You're really seeing some consistent growth there. That's organically. Inorganically, we're actually executing incredibly well on things like Payapps, and that's driving acceleration of our growth. So, we are not decelerating as a business, OK? We are actually performing solidly inorganically, we're accelerating, all right? And I just want to be really clear about that. And yes, we said year over year, we drove a 2x increase in our new customers. And I'll talk about where some of that's coming from in just a minute. But I also want to highlight the other thing that's going on we are strengthening an already strong position in the ENR 400. So, you heard about the story about power construction, which was a great example of someone taking out a competitive RFP and say, look, I need a forward-looking cloud-based solution on new technology that goes end to end from design to construction all the way to operations. And they chose us. And that was just one example that we gave in the opening commentary. So, already a strengthening position in the ENR 400. Now the other qualitative things that are driving some of that new customer growth is we already have our distribution channel operating at scale. In the U.S., this is helping us go down market more effectively, which is allowing us to capture more customers more effectively be places where we weren't before and where others aren't, which is part of driving that. But also, we're already at scale operating internationally with our distribution channel. So, that's driving international growth for us. And that's a really important driver as well as, some of those net new accounts that you're seeing there. And the last thing I'll add that I'm done with construction is that, look, I heard this over and over again at AU, I'm hearing it over and over again from customers in lots of different places. They want the end-to-end solution. They want the licensed version in the cloud, they're placing bets for the next 10 years. They want to go from design to construction to operations, and that's just making our solution more attractive to the market. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo. Your question, please. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Hey, thanks very much. I appreciate you taking the questions. A commentary on the call sounded consistent, but wondering if there are any added details you can provide for us on just the overall macro spend environment and how that's maybe progressing across either key product segments or geos, whatever split you think is more useful. I think what we're trying to get a sense for is if there are any shades of improvement anywhere or if you'd characterize as mainly just consistent over the past couple of quarters. Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Michael, I think the core answer here is consistency, OK? We're seeing consistent trends that we've seen with -- in all the other quarters. There's always puts and takes in a large business like ours, especially ones as divers as ours. But the general tone is consistent with prior quarters. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer And I would just add that there's also been a lot of noise this year from the new transaction model and then obviously, the elections and leading up to that. And so, it's hard to sparse out kind of that particular behavior. So, I think as Andrew said, we call it consistent. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Yeah, tough for us, too. That's why we keep asking. Betsy, congrats on the transition back given you're also on the board. I think it'd be useful to hear you chime in on the hiring of Janesh and maybe just also comment on how you ensure you're able to hand over the reins and keep progress going on the key transitions the company is working through. Thanks. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Per se, I was involved in the process, which was quite extensive in the company and the recruiting of Janesh. And so, we're certainly very excited to have him on board. What I would also say is, obviously, with my experience of being on the board for 11 years as well as, my deep dive into the business over the last six months. One of the reasons I'm staying around until the end of the fiscal year, is I think I could be really helpful in that transition for Janesh. And so, I'm very much looking forward to it. And I think that we have a great finance team, and I think that he's going to fit very well, and I'm looking forward to making that happen as fast as we can. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. Your question, please, Matthew. Mike Richards -- Analyst Hey, guys. This is Mike Richards on for Matt. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could provide an update on Project Bernini and maybe how customer reception has been and where we are in developing other foundational models or just the monetization opportunity there? Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, first off, before I comment on Bernini, as you might have heard from AU, AI is embedded in everything we're doing from a bottom-up and a top-down perspective. And you also heard us talk at AU about new types of foundation models we're building that understand how certain things are done in our applications. You heard about a foundation model that's driving automated drawing creation. You heard about a foundation model that's driving automated sketch generation and sketch constraints. That kind of stuff is bottom-up innovation. Bernini more of a top-down type innovation where you're actually specifying things and trying to generate a preliminary outcome from those specifications. And what we've been doing with Bernini is we've been trying to engage with certain targeted customers to get them to participate with us in making Bernini smarter and more intelligent. It's not available commercially right now. but it's getting more intelligent. We've actually been successful in getting some customers to stand up and say, look, yes, I'd like to work with you to make this more intelligent because we need something that actually understands 3D geometry as geometry, not just in the picture or something, OK? So, that's what's going on with Bernini right now, and you should continue to see refinements and extensions of that moving forward. Now with regard to monetization, monetization, nobody knows exactly how all this is going to be monetized. But there's a few vectors here that that come into play. One, we are ahead of our competitors in this space. We intend to be ahead. We're investing to stay ahead. That increase ones competitive position in the marketplace, and that's really important. Also, you get to be able to charge for some of these incremental features in the future. When you're delivering value or a high-quality outcome as a result, you're going to charge for that outcome. How we charge for those things? Let's just play out, OK? It's still early days. But there's also monetization opportunities through licensing certain technologies for specific mature maturation for specific customers' needs, all right? And that will be another avenue. So, how these avenues play out, which one waits more, let this play out. But what you need to know about Autodesk is we're ahead. We've been ahead for a while. We were the first out there with an AI research lab that been out there for over six years. It's published 70 papers. We're right on the cutting edge of 3D design technology in AI, and we intend to stay there. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of J.P. Morgan. Your question please, Steve. Stephen Tusa -- Analyst Good evening or afternoon. Lots of good questions asked. Just a detailed one. What's the change in the billings contribution from the transaction model change? The five to six to five to five and a half. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Yeah. So, it's basically because we did more buy/sell business ahead of the European launch. It's short answer. So, remember, we said 5% to 6% when we launched Europe. And it was the -- we did more buy sell business, which means there's less tailwind from the new transaction model. The flip side of -- that means that the underlying increase in our billings guidance is greater than it looks on a headline basis. Stephen Tusa -- Analyst OK, great. Thanks a lot. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Tilton of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Hey, guys, can you hear me? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Great. I have a kind of a high-level one on the incoming CFO. If I heard correctly, we didn't exactly get like an initial outlook for revenue growth for next year. And I'm just trying to understand in the context of the new CFO coming in, is there anything that could change the calculus of how you guys think about that 10% to 15% growth for the underlying business outside of the agency transition that's ongoing today. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Well, first, let's talk about that framework a little bit, and then I'll comment a little bit on the incoming CFO. So, look, the 10% to 15% growth. Right now, we're pretty much right at the bottom end of that range. And if we look back over the last two years, there's been a series of things that created headwinds to new business. It started off with things like the pandemic, the inflation, the exiting of the Russian business, the writer's strike, the whole trade wars within particular geographies. All of these things were accumulated headwinds that build slowly into the business and have pushed us down to the low end of the range. it takes time in a subscription model for those things to build out of the business, OK? So, it's going to take time for us to build out of that. That's to be expected with a subscription model. The revenue goes down slowly. It goes back up slowly as headwinds turn into tailwinds. So, expect us to be near the bottom of that range in the short term just as a general kind of guideline for the core business to be at the bottom of the range, OK? As a long-term framework, the 10% to 15% still makes sense as a long-term guide for the company. But of course, as new eyes come in, we'll look at these things, and we'll evaluate them. But right now, this all still makes sense. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Super helpful. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho. Your question, please. Siti Panigrahi -- Analyst Thanks for taking my question. I understand the new business model of some kind of noise in your expense and margin side. But if you exclude that, where do you see some of the operating leverage that you can drive in next year or so? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, I think we've actually provided kind of historically what we've done over the last three years pretty clearly. And I think we said that we continue to be focused on expansion, but nothing further to add as far as next year. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director We did provide data on that. So, you can see what underlying thing is, and we expect to see continued improvement in that same vector. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations On the same basis. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director On the same basis, on the same apples-to-apples basis. Siti Panigrahi -- Analyst OK, great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Funk of Bank of America. Your question, please. Michael Funk -- Analyst Yeah. Guys, thank you for the question tonight. Two, if I could. You've mentioned a few times in the last calls about the largest multiyear cohort renewing next year and then also a large EBA cohort. Just wondering if you can give us kind of the range of potential outcomes among the renewals there, whether a potential to upsell, risk of down sell and what that variance might look like around those renewals? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer No. I mean I think what we have said is that it's the largest cohort and we saw that performance in '23. And so, we expect a strong renewal year, but we're not giving any specific guidance on what that looks like for '26 at this point, and we'll wait until we report earnings in February. Michael Funk -- Analyst OK. Great. And then, Betsy, one more. You've mentioned a few times after the investment in new transaction model, people processes, and automation, presumably more fixed cost versus variable like commission. Can you quantify that for us to help us with modeling as we try to forecast margin? I know you've not given guidance, but better understanding of what that cost might actually be on an absolute basis would help us to think about our modeling. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Mike, we've got a slide in the earnings deck to help you think about modeling. And I'll just point you to that. Michael Funk -- Analyst OK, great. Thank you, Simon. Operator Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for Q&A today. I would now like to turn the conference back to Simon Mays-Smith for closing remarks. Sir? Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Great. Thanks, Latif, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Looking forward to seeing many of you on the road over the next few weeks. If you have any questions in the meantime, please email me or call me. And in the meantime, for those of you in North America wishing you a very happy Thanksgiving. Thank you, Latif.

[operator instructions] again, please stand compile q&a roster. first question come line jason celino keybanc capital markets. question, please. jason celino -- analyst hey, thanks taking questions. two me. first one, andrew. u unfamiliar janesh. tell u little bit brings autodesk? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director certainly can. that, let make sure thank betsy everything brought autodesk interim period. really appreciate it. company appreciates it. thank you, betsy. really excited janesh. let tell excited janesh. remember, one thing telling looking someone going able dispassionately drive optimization scale inside autodesk. really mean someone that's going really inwardly focused, looking every dollar invest making sure getting return business investor getting best return business. next kind criterion looking for, nice was, time seat sitting cfo, important u well. kind next nice optimization scale. janesh brings great balance things, right? seat seven year elastic, cfo coo, driving fairly turbulent change inside elastic. so, got battle star pushing inside company get change done inside, like that. like lot. also got good early experience company feel always added value autodesk. so, vmware senior position. cisco senior position. good success bringing people kind companies. worked company driving optimization scale, no. 1 criterion looking driving work. also another nice have. got knowledge industry. spent two year ptc career. actually recently ptc board. so, understands industry, able get speed pretty quickly. no. 1 goal drive optimization scale next years, make sure getting everything need every dollar invest, important theme autodesk. that, really excited, looking forward joining december. jason celino -- analyst ok. great. interesting. second question, cfo, thought might hold next investor day? think past, usually march. good time frame? soon? thanks. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah. well, janesh joining december. think need give time get sea leg giving time kind drive end year actually get u set next fiscal year good stead. so, would say unlikely anything spring, get back soon janesh ready talk things. operator thank you. next question come line jay vleeschhouwer griffin securities. question, please. jay vleeschhouwer -- analyst thank you. andrew, third quarter, three-year cagr current rpo 12%. thinking sustainability perhaps improvement upon cagr crpo next number years? think ingredient that, look like last several years, cagr unit volume brand roughly 6% 7% aggregate. so, top that, price ingredients, perhaps talk think might able improve upon recent trajectory current rpo. follow-up. betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer yeah. hi, jay, betsy. let give couple things. there's number thing going on, headline crpo number. first take away headwind tailwind broadly consistent second quarter. mentioned opening commentary, early renewal growth -- new transaction model providing tailwind. there's also headwind crpo growth declining contribution billed unbilled deferred revenue risk large multiyear eba cohort coming renewal fiscal '26. reminder, larger cohort calling tailwind free cash flow next year. look back fiscal '22, saw dynamic ahead fiscal '23 renewal well. jay vleeschhouwer -- analyst ok. since new management part news evening, could talk thinking chief revenue officer position. would make sense perhaps continue separate cro?

think efficiency unlock, think incremental free cash flow number next year? embedded already. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director so, many layer question. right. first, let kind answer question series stage dodge ones, ok? so, first off, optimization kind mindset autodesk. something suddenly happens. want reemphasize look right now, year, example, look apples-to-apples comparison, slide decks, disclosed material see non-gaap margin already hitting target set next year year, ok? so, optimization mentality. also heard say new transaction model start roll out, optimization go-to-market effort going critical step u part optimization journey on, that's going deliver margin growth company couple year come, ok? think that's important. long-term driver. getting specifics, ok? think specific probably another time, let kind give sense thing important, right? one drive self-service, right? self-service huge impact customer engage u customer come from, value accretive autodesk, efficiency side, renewal things, also revenue growth side capturing customer directly. thing talked understanding customer better, upsell cross-sell. so, going able lot automation understanding opportunity are, that's going drive efficiencies. moving channel partner away model transactional player solution provider ip provider customers. that's going sort opportunity eliminate duplication effort drive real cost efficiency company moving forward. there's top-line efficiency revenue growth, there's bottom line efficiency well removing redundancy step necessary customer. get lot clarity see u continue move forward go-to-market optimization next year beyond that. tyler radke -- analyst great. follow-up question, andrew, talked really strong net new customer addition within construction cloud, think, doubling year year. also saw make revenue accelerate 28% constant currency. help u understand, think reacceleration durable? sort thinking position there? what's driving strength new customer additions? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director first, let comment make revenues, going go construction. so, make revenue also includes revenue pix thing associated that. however, let's talk fact around construction business think important, right? no. 1 factor continue drive consistent, high growth construction solutions. seeing it. built make numbers, lion's share make numbers. really seeing consistent growth there. that's organically. inorganically, actually executing incredibly well thing like payapps, that's driving acceleration growth. so, decelerating business, ok? actually performing solidly inorganically, accelerating, right? want really clear that. yes, said year year, drove 2x increase new customers. talk that's coming minute. also want highlight thing that's going strengthening already strong position enr 400. so, heard story power construction, great example someone taking competitive rfp say, look, need forward-looking cloud-based solution new technology go end end design construction way operations. chose us. one example gave opening commentary. so, already strengthening position enr 400. qualitative thing driving new customer growth already distribution channel operating scale. u.s., helping u go market effectively, allowing u capture customer effectively place others aren't, part driving that. also, already scale operating internationally distribution channel. so, that's driving international growth us. that's really important driver well as, net new account seeing there. last thing add done construction that, look, heard au, hearing customer lot different places. want end-to-end solution. want licensed version cloud, placing bet next 10 years. want go design construction operations, that's making solution attractive market. operator thank you. next question come line michael turrin well fargo. question, please. michael turrin -- analyst hey, thanks much. appreciate taking questions. commentary call sounded consistent, wondering added detail provide u overall macro spend environment that's maybe progressing across either key product segment geos, whatever split think useful. think trying get sense shade improvement anywhere characterize mainly consistent past couple quarters. thanks. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director michael, think core answer consistency, ok?

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Simon Mays-Smith, VP, investor relations. Please go ahead. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Thanks, operator, and good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the third quarter results of Autodesk's fiscal '25. On the line with me is Andrew Anagnost, our CEO; and Betsy Rafael, our interim CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including outlook and related assumptions and on product and strategies. Actual events or results could differ materially. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-Q and the Form 8-K filed with today's press release for important risks and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today. If this call is replayed or reviewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Autodesk disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will quote several numeric or growth changes during this call as we discuss our financial performance. Unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison. All non-GAAP numbers referenced in today's call are reconciled in our press release or Excel financials and other supplemental materials available on our Investor Relations website. And now, I will turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Simon, and welcome, everyone, to the call. We finished the third quarter of the year strongly, delivering 12% revenue growth in constant currency and have again raised full year guidance. This reflects the sustained momentum of the business and successful execution of our strategy, including a smooth implementation of the new transaction model in Western Europe. Once again, opportunity, resilience and discipline underpinned our performance. Last month at Autodesk University in San Diego, we hosted 12,000 registered attendees and another 30,000 online. We showed how granular data in the cloud, organized the data models and connected to everything through APIs to deliver even more valuable and connected solutions for customers and partners and support a much broader ecosystem and marketplace. Customers and channel partners that I spoke with at AU remain cautiously optimistic, a sentiment consistent with the underlying momentum of our business, our growing product usage and BuildingConnected bid activity trends over recent quarters. I left AU with a tremendous sense of purpose and optimism in the ingenuity and persistence of our customers and for the future. On our earnings call last quarter, I set out our secular growth opportunities and our strategy to capitalize on them. I concluded that Autodesk's investment in cloud, platform and AI in pursuit of those opportunities were ahead of its peers. AU was a good demonstration of that. But we're also leading the industry in modernizing our go-to-market motion starting a few years ago with the subscription transition through consumption and self-service enablement and more recently to direct billing. These initiatives enable Autodesk to build larger and more durable direct relationships with its customers and to serve them more efficiently. We have already seen significant benefits from initiatives like these, and there's more to come in the next optimization phase. Taking out the effects on margins from FX and the new transaction model, we still expect to be toward the midpoint of our fiscal '26 non-GAAP operating margin target of 38% to 40% in fiscal '25, a year ahead of schedule. We're confident we will make further improvement in fiscal '26 on the same basis. The new transaction model will enable tighter channel partnerships with less duplication of effort and more digital self-service and automation, which increases customer satisfaction and workforce productivity. It will also create new opportunities for partners Autodesk to earn more with less emphasis on transaction revenue sharing and a greater emphasis on value creation for customers. Once complete, we expect the new transaction model and subsequent go-to-market optimization to increase sales and marketing efficiency and deliver GAAP margins among the best in the industry. Attractive, long-term, secular growth markets, a focused strategy delivering ever more valuable and connected solutions to our customers, and a resilient business are generating strong and sustained momentum, both in absolute terms and relative to peers. Disciplined execution and capital deployment has driven even greater operational velocity and efficiency within Autodesk and will underpin the mechanical build of revenue and free cash flow over the next few years and GAAP margins among the best in the industry. We will continue to deploy capital to offset and buy forward dilution as our free cash flow grows from the fiscal '24 trough. This practice has reduced our share count over the last three years. We have significantly increased our share repurchase authorization to extend this momentum flexibility over the medium term, with the precise trajectory remaining dependent on our debt repayment schedule and the ebb and flow of M&A. In combination, we believe these factors will deliver sustainable shareholder value over many years. Before I conclude, I'd like to formally welcome Janesh to Autodesk. We're excited to welcome Janesh, who brings a wealth of experience and will be instrumental in sustaining Autodesk's growth and enhanced profitability momentum. Of equal importance, I'd like to thank Betsy for stepping in as interim CFO at an important time in the company's journey, and I'm looking forward to continuing to work closely with her as an Autodesk Board member. I will now turn the call over to Betsy to discuss our quarterly financial performance and guidance for the year. I'll then return to provide an update on our strategic growth initiatives. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Andrew. Q3 was another strong quarter. We generated broad-based underlying growth across products and regions. In addition, we saw revenue increases from the new transaction model and M&A which were offset by the absence of enterprise business agreement true-ups from Q3 last year and FX. Our Make products continued to enhance growth, driven by our ongoing strength in construction and Fusion. Overall, macroeconomic policy and geopolitical challenges and the underlying momentum of the business were consistent with the last few quarters, with continued strong renewal rates and headwinds to our new business growth. Total revenue grew 11% and 12% in constant currency. By product, in constant currency, AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT revenue grew 8%. AEC revenue, which was most impacted by the absence of true-up revenues, grew 12%, Manufacturing revenue grew 16% and still comfortably in double digits, excluding upfront revenue. And M&E revenue grew 15% boosted by the PIX acquisition and associated integration adjustments. By region, in constant currency, revenue grew 11% in the Americas which was most impacted by the absence of true-up revenues, 13% in EMEA and 14% in APAC. The mechanical contribution from the new transaction model to revenue was $17 million in the third quarter and $25 million on a year-to-date basis. Direct revenue increased 23% and represented 42% of total revenue, up 4 percentage points from last year, benefiting from strong growth in both EBAs and the Autodesk store and also the natural tailwind to revenue from the new transaction model. Net revenue retention rate remained within the 100% to 110% range at constant exchange rates. Billings increased 28% in the quarter, reflecting a tailwind from the prior-year shift to annual billings for most multiyear contracts, early renewals and the natural tailwind from the transition to the new transaction model. Similar to last quarter, and as expected, co-terming negatively impacted billing ahead of the launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe. The natural contribution from the new transaction model to billing was $72 million in the third quarter and $108 million on a year-to-date basis. Total deferred revenue decreased 9% to $3.7 billion and was again impacted by the transition from upfront to annual billings for multiyear contracts. Total RPO of $6.1 billion and current RPO of $4.0 billion grew 17% and 14%, respectively, which reflects a tailwind from early renewals and the new transaction model and a headwind from the declining contribution of billed and unbilled deferred revenue from large, multiyear and EBA cohorts ahead of renewal in fiscal '26. Excluding these, current RPO growth was broadly consistent with Q2. We do expect the new transaction model and the larger FY '26 renewal cohorts to have a greater impact on both RPO and current RPO growth in Q4 of fiscal '25. Turning to margins. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were broadly low. With Autodesk University shifting back to Q3 this year from Q4 last year, GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins decreased by 2 and 3 percentage points, respectively. The timing effect from AU obviously washes out over the full year. At current course and speed, the ratio of stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue peaked in fiscal '24, will follow by more than a percentage point in fiscal '25 and will be below 10% over time. Free cash flow for the quarter was $199 million. This benefited from some channel partners in Western Europe booking business earlier in the quarter ahead of the transition to the new transaction model really to derisk month one after the transition. This accelerated free cash flow to the third quarter, which was partially offset by the expected negative impact of co-terming in Western Europe. Turning now to capital allocation. We continue to actively manage capital within our framework and deploy it with discipline and focus through the economic cycle to drive long-term shareholder value. As expected, the pace of buybacks picked up in the third quarter. We purchased approximately 1.2 million shares for $319 million at an average price of approximately $269 per share. We will continue to deploy capital to offset and buy forward dilution as our free cash flow grows from the fiscal '24 trough. This practice has reduced our share count by about 5 million shares over the last three years with an average percentage reduction of about 70 basis points per year. We increased the amount authorized under our share repurchase program by $5 billion for a total of approximately $9 billion. This expands our flexibility over the medium term with the precise trajectory remaining dependent on our debt repayment schedule as well as, the ebbs and flow of M&A. Now let me finish with guidance. As we said in the February, the pace of the rollout of the new transaction model will create noise in billings and the P&L. So, we think free cash flow is the best measure of our performance. Taking out that noise, the underlying momentum in the business remains consistent with the expectations embedded in our guidance range for the full year with continued strong renewal rates and headwinds to new business growth. Our sustained momentum in the third quarter and smooth launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe, reduced the likelihood of our more cautious forecast scenario. Given that, we're raising the midpoint of our billing, revenue, margin, earnings per share and free cash flow guidance ranges. So, let me give you a little bit more detail. The underlying momentum of billing is in line with our expectations. Compared to our modeling at the start of the year, the launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe in Q3 and early renewals have been a tailwind for billings, whereas more co-terming, more business done under the old buy-sell model before the launch of the new transaction model and in recent weeks, FX movement have been headwinds for billing. We now estimate that the new transaction model will provide between a 5 and 5.5 percentage point tailwind to billings growth in fiscal '25. We've raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 billings guidance by $10 million to a range of $5.90 billion to $5.98 billion. The underlying momentum of revenue is also in line with our expectations. We estimate the new transaction model will provide around 1 to 1.5 percentage point tailwind to revenue growth in fiscal '25. Upfront revenue contributed 2 percentage points to revenue growth in Q4 of fiscal '24, and therefore, this is a headwind in Q4 of fiscal '25. While not large enough to call out at the start of the year, it was already factored into our Q4 and our full year model. We've raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 revenue guidance range by $18 million to a range of $6.12 billion to $6.13 billion. We're increasing our GAAP and non-GAAP margin guidance midpoint by 25 basis points by raising the bottom end of the ranges by 50 basis points. The GAAP margin guidance range is now 21.5% to 22%. The non-GAAP margin guidance range is now 35.5% to 36%, which includes a 1 to 1.5 percentage point underlying margin improvement, broadly offset by the margin headwinds from the new transaction model and the related incremental investments in people, processes and automation. The underlying momentum of free cash flow is also in line with our expectations. The headwind to billings from co-terming and FX rates that I mentioned earlier, is being offset by early renewals, faster collections and improved underlying margins. We raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 free cash flow guidance by $10 million and tightened the range to $1.47 billion to $1.5 billion. We expect strong free cash flow growth in fiscal '26 because of the return of our largest multiyear renewal cohort the natural mechanical stacking of multiyear contracts billed annually and a larger EBA cohort. With our current trajectory, we still estimate free cash flow in fiscal '26 to be around $2.05 billion at the midpoint. The slide deck on our website has more details on modeling assumptions for Q3 and for the full fiscal year '25. And while this may be my last earnings call for Autodesk, I will stick around for a bit to ensure a smooth transition to Janesh. Thank you, Andrew, and everyone at Autodesk for your support while I was here and to the many investors and the analysts with whom I've had lively discussions over the last few quarters. While the transition to annual billings for multiyear contracts and the deployment of the new transaction model has created noise and billings in the P&L, they do provide a natural near-term tailwind to revenue and free cash flow growth. Combined with a resilient business model, sustained competitive momentum, Autodesk has enviable sources of visibility and certainty to very uncertain world. For all these reasons, I stepped down from my role as interim CFO with tremendous optimism for the future. Andrew, back to you. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Betsy. Let me finish by updating you on our strong progress in the third quarter. We continue to see good momentum in AEC, particularly in infrastructure and construction, fueled by customers consolidating onto our solutions to connect and optimize previously siloed workflows through the cloud. The cornerstone of that growing interest is our comprehensive end-to-end solutions in completing designs, preconstruction, field execution through handover and into operations. This breadth of connected capability enables us to extend our footprint further into infrastructure and construction and also expand our reach into the mid-market. As a sign of our growing momentum as the benefits of our end-to-end solution become more apparent, our construction business continue to perform robustly with net new customers doubling year over year and existing customers' renewal and expansion rates remaining strong. Let me give you a few examples. Power Construction is No. 79 on the Engineering News Record, ENR Top 400 U.S. contractor list. It is a Chicago-based general contractor serving residential and nonresidential end markets. After completing a competitive RFP to replace its legacy project management tool, Power selected Autodesk for its unified construction platform across preconstruction, construction, and DDC. By standardizing on Autodesk Construction Cloud, Power will have a single source of truth for project data, enhanced collaboration capabilities, and streamlined workflows on a single platform. Power Construction was one of two ENR 400 top 100 U.S. contractors that standardized enterprisewide on Autodesk build during the quarter. In Europe, Bouygues, a top 10 ENR 250 international contractor based in France and a leader in sustainable building and infrastructure projects renewed and expanded its EBA in the quarter. Bouygues is continuing to consolidate on Autodesk solutions across the enterprise, including broader adoption of Autodesk Forma, Carbon Insight, and Informed Design to digitize, decarbonize, and industrialize projects. It also significantly increased its commitment to Autodesk Construction Cloud to drive efficiency gains and faster bid response times through better collaboration between design and project teams. Surbana Jurong is No. 23 on ENR's top 225 international design firms. Based in Singapore, it is an urban infrastructure and integrated solutions consulting firm. In Q3, it renewed its third EBA, which included increased investment in Autodesk Construction Cloud and Autodesk Water infrastructure solutions. ACC is helping to scale its operations through increased automation, integrated design workflows and enhanced collaboration across time zones. Our water infrastructure solutions will be a core technology supporting its growth ambitions in planning, designing, engineering and managing water projects for customers worldwide. Again, these stories have a common theme. Managing people, processes and data across the project life cycle to increase efficiency and sustainability while decreasing risk. Over time, we expect the majority of all projects to be managed this way, and we remain focused on enabling that transition through our industry cloud. Moving on to manufacturing. We made excellent progress on our strategic initiatives. Customers continue to invest in their digital transformation and consolidate our Design and Make platform. Fusion remains one of the fastest-growing products in the manufacturing industry. As customers seek to drive innovation and growth at lower cost, Fusion extension attach rates are increasing, which is helping to drive the average sales price higher. For example, in the quarter, a global manufacturer supplying the semiconductor industry selected Fusion Manage and Vault PLM over competitive solutions to foster greater collaboration across manufacturing sites and improve operating efficiency. Once fully scaled and operational, this customer expects to save 105,000 hours per year by connecting people and data, resulting in reduced product development costs and faster time to market. In the U.K., Playdale Playground has been designing, manufacturing, and installing outdoor playground equipment for over 40 years. This quarter, Playdale added Fusion to its existing portfolio of Autodesk solutions, including Inventor, AutoCAD, and Vault to streamline and digitize workflows, optimize production to reduce lead times, reduce nonconformities, and replace inefficient Excel-driven operations on the shop floor. A long time Autodesk customer and global leader in precision engineering solutions renewed and expanded its EBA in the quarter. In addition to Inventor, vault and AutoCAD, it is adopting Fusion's generative design capabilities for material waste reduction and fluid flow optimization and Moldflow to reduce manufacturing costs and defects while increasing mold yields. In education, universities continue to modernize their courses and curriculum to attract and prepare future engineers. For example, from this winter, students at the University of Stuttgart, Institute for Medical Device Technology will use Fusion across six courses. Fusion was selected to replace a competitive solution for its modern platform, ease of use, cloud collaboration capabilities and unique combination of PCB and additive manufacturing workflows in a single team environment. And lastly, we continue to work with our customers to ensure they are using the latest and most secure versions of our software. For example, after a period of rapid scaling and diversification, a large multinational manufacturing company in APAC was looking to align compliance rates across its global employee base. Working collaboratively we address compliance issues while cementing a long-term partnership and completing one of our largest ever license compliance agreements, which included expanded adoption of Alias and VRED for the Design Studio and PDMC for mechanical engineering and rail design. Attractive long-term secular growth markets, a focused strategy delivering ever more valuable and connected solutions to our customers and a resilient business are generating strong and sustained momentum both in absolute terms and relative to peers. Disciplined execution and capital deployment is driving an even greater operational velocity and efficiency within Autodesk, and we continue to deploy capital to deliver sustainable shareholder value over many years. I retain a tremendous sense of purpose and optimism in the ingenuity and persistence of our customers and for the future. Operator, we would now like to open the call up for questions. Questions & Answers: Operator Thank you. [Operator instructions] Again, please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Jason Celino of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your question, please. Jason Celino -- Analyst Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Just two for me. The first one, Andrew. Some of us are unfamiliar with Janesh. Can you just tell us a little bit more about him and what he brings to Autodesk? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director I certainly can. Before I do that, let me make sure that I thank Betsy for everything she brought to Autodesk during this interim period. I really appreciate it. The company appreciates it. Thank you, Betsy. Now we're really excited about Janesh. Let me tell you why we're excited about Janesh. As you remember, one of the things I was telling you that I was looking for was someone that was going to be able to dispassionately drive optimization at scale inside of Autodesk. And what that really means is someone that's going to be really inwardly focused, looking at every dollar that we invest and making sure that we're getting the most return for the business that investors are getting the best return from their business. The next kind of criteria we were looking for, which was nice to have was, time in the seat as a sitting CFO, which was important for us as well. But it was kind of the next nice to have after the optimization at scale. Janesh brings a great balance of both of those things, right? He's been in the seat seven years at Elastic, both CFO and COO, driving some fairly turbulent changes inside of Elastic. So, he's got battle stars from pushing inside the company to get changes done inside, and we like that. We like that a lot. He's also got very good early experience at companies that we feel have always added value to Autodesk. So, he was it VMware in a senior position. He was at Cisco in a senior position. We've had good success bringing people from those kind of companies. He worked at those companies driving optimization at scale, which is the No. 1 criteria I was looking for when we we're driving this work. He also has another nice to have. He's got knowledge of our industry. He spent two years at PTC in his career. He was actually recently on the PTC board. So, he understands our industry, and he'll be able to get up to speed pretty quickly. The No. 1 goal here drive optimization and scale over the next few years, make sure that we're getting everything we need from every dollar we invest, which is a very important theme for Autodesk. And with that, I'm really excited, and I'm looking forward to him joining in December. Jason Celino -- Analyst OK. Great. Interesting. And then for my second question, now that you do have a CFO, do you have any thoughts on when you might hold the next Investor Day? I think in the past, you usually did it in March. Is that a good time frame? Or is that too soon? Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. Well, Janesh is joining in December. I think we need to give him time to get his sea legs on giving time to kind of drive the end of the year and actually get us set up for next fiscal year in good stead. So, I would say it's unlikely we'll be doing anything in the spring, but we'll get back to you on that as soon as Janesh is ready to talk about those things. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Your question, please. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst Thank you. Andrew, as of the third quarter, your three-year CAGR for current RPO is about 12%. How are you thinking about the sustainability or perhaps improvement upon that CAGR or CRPO over the next number of years? When we think about the ingredients of that, it looks like over the last several years, the CAGR for your unit volume for all brands is roughly 6% to 7% in the aggregate. So, on top of that, you've had price and other ingredients, but perhaps talk about how you think you might be able to improve upon the most recent trajectory for current RPO. Then my follow-up. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Hi, Jay, this is Betsy. Let me just give you a couple of things. There's a number of things that are going on, on the headline of the CRPO number. If you first take away the headwinds and the tailwinds was broadly consistent with the second quarter. And as I mentioned in my opening commentary, early renewals and growth with -- and the new transaction model are providing a tailwind. And then there's also a headwind to CRPO growth from the declining contribution of billed and unbilled deferred revenue risk from the large multiyear EBA cohorts coming up for renewal in fiscal '26. And just as a reminder, these are the same larger cohorts we are calling out as the tailwinds to free cash flow for next year. And if you look back to fiscal '22, we saw the same dynamic ahead of the fiscal '23 renewals as well. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst OK. Since new management is part of the news this evening, could you talk about how you're thinking about the chief revenue officer position. Would it make sense perhaps to continue to have a separate CRO? Or do you think it might make more sense perhaps to combine CRO and COO? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, we're going to continue to have a separate CRO because we have various functions that work together there under the COO organization, including our IT organization, our infrastructure and all things associated. What we're looking for in our CRO is someone that understands how to continue to drive a business when you have direct engagement with the customer. So, that means someone that really understands what it takes to analyze self-service patterns, actually understand the data that comes in from the customers to help drive cross-sell and upsell while also transforming a channel from a transactionally focused extension of Autodesk to kind of a solution partner that's driving life cycle solutions for our customers. So, that's the kind of role we're looking for here. And yes, it's going to continue to be a stand-alone CRO role within the COO organization. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Borg of Stifel. Your line is open. Adam Borg -- Analyst Awesome. Thanks so much for taking the questions, and congrats to Betsy and Janesh. Maybe on the new transaction model. I know it's still early. But I was just curious, are there any learnings from those customers that are on the new model that you're seeing in terms of the adoption of Autodesk technology and the ability to find white space to better upsell and cross-sell different solutions now that you have a more direct relationship. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah, Adam, it's really early on to be able to make any kind of conclusions about that. What I can tell you is that we definitely see some shifts to some of the direct channels at Autodesk for customers that were probably just served on a very kind of arm's length kind of transactional level. But in terms of driving cross-sell and upsell, early days, early days. But if you want to get a sense for how that might evolve, we've got experience with our EBAs and our enterprise business agreements. And we've learned over the years that having that kind of relationship with the customer where we really understand their usage patterns, who they are and what they're doing, we are much more effective at driving cross-sell and upsell even when partnering with our channel partners. So, I think those kind of stand as a testament of what's possible as we move forward with completion of the new transaction model. Adam Borg -- Analyst Great. And maybe just as a quick follow-up. Just as we think about the new administration coming in, you talked about the macro being broadly consistent. Any change in tone in your conversations with the end markets in terms of optimism or their ability or willingness to expand new projects ahead of the administration? Any pause or just full steam ahead? I'm just curious, any commentary you have there from a macro perspective would be really, really helpful. Thanks so much. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director What I'll say is the things that matter to our customers are bipartisan things, all right? Our customers care about infrastructure builds out. Both parties care about infrastructure build-outs. Our customers care about domestic manufacturing in Europe, be it in the United States, both parties agree that the domestic manufacturing build-outs are important. Supply chain, independent, supply chain stability. All of these things are bipartisan issues that really affect our customers. So, regardless of the administration, I suspect the things that are important to our customers are continuing to be a focus. Adam Borg -- Analyst Thanks, again. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink of Baird. Please go ahead, Joe. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst Thank you. On the outlook for next year, $2.050 billion in free cash has, I think, been the expectation for the past year now. Within the last year, you've also seen more co-term of contracts. And I think that leads to better billings in FY '26. So, my question is, does that actually create the potential that things are better, and that's why you're qualifying now the $2.050 billion as the midpoint of possibilities. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer There's no change to how we've talked about the free cash flow guide for fiscal '26, it continues to be $2.05 billion at the mid-point. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst OK. Fair enough. And then just on the M&A environment, over recent history, Autodesk has been more in a mode of, I would say, strategic tuck-ins. I think there is actually an asset in the CFD simulation space that was announced during AU in the quarter. Is that the right approach for Autodesk, just given this point in time, all the work you've done to build out the cloud platform, the data models, and so these tuck-ins make the most sense? And if that's true, how would you maybe compare and contrast some of the larger-scale M&A that's happening with your peers in the space? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, look, consolidation in our space is inevitable. I'm not going to comment on any specific deals, but here's what I'll say. Autodesk has always been an acquisitive company, and we will be an inquisitive company when that makes both strategic and financial sense for the company. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst OK. Thank you. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Joe. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Porter of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Elizabeth. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great, thanks so much for the question. As partners are getting customers just up and running on the new transaction model, we picked up that they're spending a little bit more time than usual of time and resources with those existing customers. So, I was curious if that had any impact on new business demand kind of more recently -- and then just more broadly, any change in new business trends that you think you should call out from versus last quarter? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Elizabeth, it's Betsy. And so, just broadly speaking, we continue to see growth, but at a slower pace due to a number of factors really over the last several years, macro, COVID, exiting Russia, elections, and while a drag on the forward momentum of the business, all of that really factored into our guidance. So, I kind of just will leave it at that. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great. And then a follow-up just on billings. I understand there's a lot of volatility around the change from multiyear in the transaction model. But it looks like guidance implies a bigger step down in growth in Q4, just despite easier year-ago compare. So, hoping that you could help us unpack the balance of those headwinds and tailwinds that would drive kind of a greater downtick in growth in Q4. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, again, let me start out with just from a fiscal '25 perspective. Your billing tailwinds are going to be from the final shift to annual billings, new transaction model and early renewals. And you're going to get headwinds from co-terming and business booked ahead of the new transaction model launch and in recent weeks, some FX. So, again, I think that we've continued to perform well as we've executed through through Q3. And so, I think we feel very, very strongly about our expectations for Q4. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bhavin Shah of Deutsche Bank. Your question please, Bhavin. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Great, thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the quarter. Andrew, at university, there appeared to be a noticeable uptick in attendance and sessions geared toward owners and operators. What been driving the recent interest from the segment? How much of it is product enhancements you guys have made versus really more focusing and emphasizing from a go-to-market perspective? And how long before this segment of buyers kind of becomes more meaningful to the financials? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah, Bhavin, that's an excellent question, right. We're very interested in tackling the whole entire life cycle from design, through make, construction, manufacturing, all the way into operations. You're probably aware we have a product called Tandem. And a lot of those sessions were driven by increasing interest and increasing adoption of Tandem, which is a digital twin solution, tightly coupled to our solutions that also has a toolkit that allows people to easily connect sensor data through the digital twin solution. So, you're seeing that uptick because we're directly releasing products and capabilities that are of interest to the owner space. You can expect to see that trend continue over time, and you can expect to see us continue to talk about the owner space, continue to deliver solutions for the owner space and even APIs for the owner space. It's an area of great interest, especially when it comes not only to vertical buildings, but factories and other things that are related to that as well as, infrastructure like what we were doing with some of our water owner solutions. So, yes, owners matter. We're building software for them, and you're going to see more of that. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Super helpful there. And then, Betsy, one for you. Just in terms of the underlying improvement that we've been seeing in the margins, and I know you've called out FX and the transaction model. I know it's very early, but as you think about next year, how do we think about like the impact of FX and the transaction model to kind of the headline operating margins? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, I wish I could give you that answer, but I think that the new CFO would probably have a little bit of a problem with that. So, we'll wait till the end of February to give you more specifics on that. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Fair enough. Thanks for taking may questions. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Good try. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke of Citi. Please go ahead, Tyler. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Yeah, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I was going to ask you about a placeholder for next year's guidance, Betsy. don't want to waste a question on that, but feel free to answer. But Andrew, I wanted to kind of ask you about some of your comments you made around efficiency, especially as it relates to hiring Janesh, who you pointed out has a lot of experience at larger companies, VMware, Cisco, et cetera. Now that you're a few quarters into this transaction model rollout, you have kind of visibility better on some of the channel prior channel relationships, having that direct billing with the customer. What are some of the areas that you've identified as having that efficiency potential? And then as we think about that efficiency unlock, should we think about that as incremental to the free cash flow number you have out for next year? Or is that embedded in that already. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director So, many layers to that question. All right. First, let me kind of answer the question in a series of stages then dodge other ones, OK? So, first off, optimization is kind of a mindset at Autodesk. It's not something that that suddenly happens. I want to reemphasize that because if you look right now, this year, for example, when you look at the apples-to-apples comparison, which will be in the slide decks, are in our disclosed materials you can see that our non-GAAP margins are already hitting the targets we set for next year this year, OK? So, optimization is a mentality. You've also heard me say over and over again as the new transaction model starts to roll out, optimization of our go-to-market efforts is going to be a critical step for us and part of the optimization journey that we're on, that's going to deliver margin growth for the company for couple of years to come, OK? And I think that's important. It's a long-term driver. Now with getting into the specifics, OK? I think the specifics are probably for another time, but let me just kind of give you a sense for some of the things that are important, right? One is the drive to self-service, right? Self-service is a huge impact on how our customers will engage with us and where those customers come from, and that is value accretive to Autodesk, both on an efficiency side, from renewals and other things, but also on the revenue growth side through capturing the customers directly. The other thing I talked about is understanding the customer better, so the upsell and cross-sell. So, we're going to be able to do a lot more automation and understanding about where the opportunities are, and that's going to drive some efficiencies. And we're moving the channel partners away from this model of being the transactional players to being the solution providers and the IP providers to our customers. That's going to have all sorts of opportunities to eliminate duplication of effort and drive real cost efficiencies for the company moving forward. There's both top-line efficiencies here in revenue growth, but there's bottom line efficiencies as well through removing the redundancies and steps that just aren't necessary for the customer. You'll get a lot more clarity on that as you see us continue to move forward with this go-to-market optimization in the next year and beyond that. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Great. And then my follow-up question, Andrew, you talked about some really strong net new customer additions within the Construction Cloud, I think, doubling year over year. we also saw the Make revenue accelerate to 28% constant currency. Can you just help us understand, do you think that reacceleration is durable? And how are you sort of thinking about just your position there? What's been driving that strength in the new customer additions? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director First, let me comment on the make revenues, then I'm going to go into construction. So, the make revenue also includes some revenue from PIX and things associated with that. However, let's talk about the facts around our construction business because I think this is important, right? No. 1 factor is that we continue to drive consistent, high growth in our construction solutions. You're seeing it. It's built into the Make numbers, and it's the lion's share of those Make numbers. You're really seeing some consistent growth there. That's organically. Inorganically, we're actually executing incredibly well on things like Payapps, and that's driving acceleration of our growth. So, we are not decelerating as a business, OK? We are actually performing solidly inorganically, we're accelerating, all right? And I just want to be really clear about that. And yes, we said year over year, we drove a 2x increase in our new customers. And I'll talk about where some of that's coming from in just a minute. But I also want to highlight the other thing that's going on we are strengthening an already strong position in the ENR 400. So, you heard about the story about power construction, which was a great example of someone taking out a competitive RFP and say, look, I need a forward-looking cloud-based solution on new technology that goes end to end from design to construction all the way to operations. And they chose us. And that was just one example that we gave in the opening commentary. So, already a strengthening position in the ENR 400. Now the other qualitative things that are driving some of that new customer growth is we already have our distribution channel operating at scale. In the U.S., this is helping us go down market more effectively, which is allowing us to capture more customers more effectively be places where we weren't before and where others aren't, which is part of driving that. But also, we're already at scale operating internationally with our distribution channel. So, that's driving international growth for us. And that's a really important driver as well as, some of those net new accounts that you're seeing there. And the last thing I'll add that I'm done with construction is that, look, I heard this over and over again at AU, I'm hearing it over and over again from customers in lots of different places. They want the end-to-end solution. They want the licensed version in the cloud, they're placing bets for the next 10 years. They want to go from design to construction to operations, and that's just making our solution more attractive to the market. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo. Your question, please. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Hey, thanks very much. I appreciate you taking the questions. A commentary on the call sounded consistent, but wondering if there are any added details you can provide for us on just the overall macro spend environment and how that's maybe progressing across either key product segments or geos, whatever split you think is more useful. I think what we're trying to get a sense for is if there are any shades of improvement anywhere or if you'd characterize as mainly just consistent over the past couple of quarters. Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Michael, I think the core answer here is consistency, OK? We're seeing consistent trends that we've seen with -- in all the other quarters. There's always puts and takes in a large business like ours, especially ones as divers as ours. But the general tone is consistent with prior quarters. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer And I would just add that there's also been a lot of noise this year from the new transaction model and then obviously, the elections and leading up to that. And so, it's hard to sparse out kind of that particular behavior. So, I think as Andrew said, we call it consistent. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Yeah, tough for us, too. That's why we keep asking. Betsy, congrats on the transition back given you're also on the board. I think it'd be useful to hear you chime in on the hiring of Janesh and maybe just also comment on how you ensure you're able to hand over the reins and keep progress going on the key transitions the company is working through. Thanks. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Per se, I was involved in the process, which was quite extensive in the company and the recruiting of Janesh. And so, we're certainly very excited to have him on board. What I would also say is, obviously, with my experience of being on the board for 11 years as well as, my deep dive into the business over the last six months. One of the reasons I'm staying around until the end of the fiscal year, is I think I could be really helpful in that transition for Janesh. And so, I'm very much looking forward to it. And I think that we have a great finance team, and I think that he's going to fit very well, and I'm looking forward to making that happen as fast as we can. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. Your question, please, Matthew. Mike Richards -- Analyst Hey, guys. This is Mike Richards on for Matt. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could provide an update on Project Bernini and maybe how customer reception has been and where we are in developing other foundational models or just the monetization opportunity there? Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, first off, before I comment on Bernini, as you might have heard from AU, AI is embedded in everything we're doing from a bottom-up and a top-down perspective. And you also heard us talk at AU about new types of foundation models we're building that understand how certain things are done in our applications. You heard about a foundation model that's driving automated drawing creation. You heard about a foundation model that's driving automated sketch generation and sketch constraints. That kind of stuff is bottom-up innovation. Bernini more of a top-down type innovation where you're actually specifying things and trying to generate a preliminary outcome from those specifications. And what we've been doing with Bernini is we've been trying to engage with certain targeted customers to get them to participate with us in making Bernini smarter and more intelligent. It's not available commercially right now. but it's getting more intelligent. We've actually been successful in getting some customers to stand up and say, look, yes, I'd like to work with you to make this more intelligent because we need something that actually understands 3D geometry as geometry, not just in the picture or something, OK? So, that's what's going on with Bernini right now, and you should continue to see refinements and extensions of that moving forward. Now with regard to monetization, monetization, nobody knows exactly how all this is going to be monetized. But there's a few vectors here that that come into play. One, we are ahead of our competitors in this space. We intend to be ahead. We're investing to stay ahead. That increase ones competitive position in the marketplace, and that's really important. Also, you get to be able to charge for some of these incremental features in the future. When you're delivering value or a high-quality outcome as a result, you're going to charge for that outcome. How we charge for those things? Let's just play out, OK? It's still early days. But there's also monetization opportunities through licensing certain technologies for specific mature maturation for specific customers' needs, all right? And that will be another avenue. So, how these avenues play out, which one waits more, let this play out. But what you need to know about Autodesk is we're ahead. We've been ahead for a while. We were the first out there with an AI research lab that been out there for over six years. It's published 70 papers. We're right on the cutting edge of 3D design technology in AI, and we intend to stay there. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of J.P. Morgan. Your question please, Steve. Stephen Tusa -- Analyst Good evening or afternoon. Lots of good questions asked. Just a detailed one. What's the change in the billings contribution from the transaction model change? The five to six to five to five and a half. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Yeah. So, it's basically because we did more buy/sell business ahead of the European launch. It's short answer. So, remember, we said 5% to 6% when we launched Europe. And it was the -- we did more buy sell business, which means there's less tailwind from the new transaction model. The flip side of -- that means that the underlying increase in our billings guidance is greater than it looks on a headline basis. Stephen Tusa -- Analyst OK, great. Thanks a lot. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Tilton of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Hey, guys, can you hear me? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Great. I have a kind of a high-level one on the incoming CFO. If I heard correctly, we didn't exactly get like an initial outlook for revenue growth for next year. And I'm just trying to understand in the context of the new CFO coming in, is there anything that could change the calculus of how you guys think about that 10% to 15% growth for the underlying business outside of the agency transition that's ongoing today. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Well, first, let's talk about that framework a little bit, and then I'll comment a little bit on the incoming CFO. So, look, the 10% to 15% growth. Right now, we're pretty much right at the bottom end of that range. And if we look back over the last two years, there's been a series of things that created headwinds to new business. It started off with things like the pandemic, the inflation, the exiting of the Russian business, the writer's strike, the whole trade wars within particular geographies. All of these things were accumulated headwinds that build slowly into the business and have pushed us down to the low end of the range. it takes time in a subscription model for those things to build out of the business, OK? So, it's going to take time for us to build out of that. That's to be expected with a subscription model. The revenue goes down slowly. It goes back up slowly as headwinds turn into tailwinds. So, expect us to be near the bottom of that range in the short term just as a general kind of guideline for the core business to be at the bottom of the range, OK? As a long-term framework, the 10% to 15% still makes sense as a long-term guide for the company. But of course, as new eyes come in, we'll look at these things, and we'll evaluate them. But right now, this all still makes sense. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Super helpful. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho. Your question, please. Siti Panigrahi -- Analyst Thanks for taking my question. I understand the new business model of some kind of noise in your expense and margin side. But if you exclude that, where do you see some of the operating leverage that you can drive in next year or so? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, I think we've actually provided kind of historically what we've done over the last three years pretty clearly. And I think we said that we continue to be focused on expansion, but nothing further to add as far as next year. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director We did provide data on that. So, you can see what underlying thing is, and we expect to see continued improvement in that same vector. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations On the same basis. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director On the same basis, on the same apples-to-apples basis. Siti Panigrahi -- Analyst OK, great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Funk of Bank of America. Your question, please. Michael Funk -- Analyst Yeah. Guys, thank you for the question tonight. Two, if I could. You've mentioned a few times in the last calls about the largest multiyear cohort renewing next year and then also a large EBA cohort. Just wondering if you can give us kind of the range of potential outcomes among the renewals there, whether a potential to upsell, risk of down sell and what that variance might look like around those renewals? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer No. I mean I think what we have said is that it's the largest cohort and we saw that performance in '23. And so, we expect a strong renewal year, but we're not giving any specific guidance on what that looks like for '26 at this point, and we'll wait until we report earnings in February. Michael Funk -- Analyst OK. Great. And then, Betsy, one more. You've mentioned a few times after the investment in new transaction model, people processes, and automation, presumably more fixed cost versus variable like commission. Can you quantify that for us to help us with modeling as we try to forecast margin? I know you've not given guidance, but better understanding of what that cost might actually be on an absolute basis would help us to think about our modeling. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Mike, we've got a slide in the earnings deck to help you think about modeling. And I'll just point you to that. Michael Funk -- Analyst OK, great. Thank you, Simon. Operator Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for Q&A today.

think efficiency unlock, think incremental free cash flow number next year? embedded already. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director so, many layer question. right. first, let kind answer question series stage dodge ones, ok? so, first off, optimization kind mindset autodesk. something suddenly happens. want reemphasize look right now, year, example, look apples-to-apples comparison, slide decks, disclosed material see non-gaap margin already hitting target set next year year, ok? so, optimization mentality. also heard say new transaction model start roll out, optimization go-to-market effort going critical step u part optimization journey on, that's going deliver margin growth company couple year come, ok? think that's important. long-term driver. getting specifics, ok? think specific probably another time, let kind give sense thing important, right? one drive self-service, right? self-service huge impact customer engage u customer come from, value accretive autodesk, efficiency side, renewal things, also revenue growth side capturing customer directly. thing talked understanding customer better, upsell cross-sell. so, going able lot automation understanding opportunity are, that's going drive efficiencies. moving channel partner away model transactional player solution provider ip provider customers. that's going sort opportunity eliminate duplication effort drive real cost efficiency company moving forward. there's top-line efficiency revenue growth, there's bottom line efficiency well removing redundancy step necessary customer. get lot clarity see u continue move forward go-to-market optimization next year beyond that. tyler radke -- analyst great. follow-up question, andrew, talked really strong net new customer addition within construction cloud, think, doubling year year. also saw make revenue accelerate 28% constant currency. help u understand, think reacceleration durable? sort thinking position there? what's driving strength new customer additions? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director first, let comment make revenues, going go construction. so, make revenue also includes revenue pix thing associated that. however, let's talk fact around construction business think important, right? no. 1 factor continue drive consistent, high growth construction solutions. seeing it. built make numbers, lion's share make numbers. really seeing consistent growth there. that's organically. inorganically, actually executing incredibly well thing like payapps, that's driving acceleration growth. so, decelerating business, ok? actually performing solidly inorganically, accelerating, right? want really clear that. yes, said year year, drove 2x increase new customers. talk that's coming minute. also want highlight thing that's going strengthening already strong position enr 400. so, heard story power construction, great example someone taking competitive rfp say, look, need forward-looking cloud-based solution new technology go end end design construction way operations. chose us. one example gave opening commentary. so, already strengthening position enr 400. qualitative thing driving new customer growth already distribution channel operating scale. u.s., helping u go market effectively, allowing u capture customer effectively place others aren't, part driving that. also, already scale operating internationally distribution channel. so, that's driving international growth us. that's really important driver well as, net new account seeing there. last thing add done construction that, look, heard au, hearing customer lot different places. want end-to-end solution. want licensed version cloud, placing bet next 10 years. want go design construction operations, that's making solution attractive market. operator thank you. next question come line michael turrin well fargo. question, please. michael turrin -- analyst hey, thanks much. appreciate taking questions. commentary call sounded consistent, wondering added detail provide u overall macro spend environment that's maybe progressing across either key product segment geos, whatever split think useful. think trying get sense shade improvement anywhere characterize mainly consistent past couple quarters. thanks. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director michael, think core answer consistency, ok? seeing consistent trend seen -- quarters. there's always put take large business like ours, especially one diver ours. general tone consistent prior quarters. betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer would add there's also lot noise year new transaction model obviously, election leading that. so, hard sparse kind particular behavior. so, think andrew said, call consistent. michael turrin -- analyst yeah, tough us, too. that's keep asking. betsy, congrats transition back given also board. think useful hear chime hiring janesh maybe also comment ensure able hand rein keep progress going key transition company working through. thanks. betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer per se, involved process, quite extensive company recruiting janesh. so, certainly excited board. would also say is, obviously, experience board 11 year well as, deep dive business last six months. one reason staying around end fiscal year, think could really helpful transition janesh. so, much looking forward it. think great finance team, think going fit well, looking forward making happen fast can. michael turrin -- analyst thank you. operator thank you. next question come line matthew hedberg rbc capital markets. question, please, matthew. mike richards -- analyst hey, guys. mike richards matt. thanks taking question. wondering could provide update project bernini maybe customer reception developing foundational model monetization opportunity there? thanks. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah. so, first off, comment bernini, might heard au, ai embedded everything bottom-up top-down perspective. also heard u talk au new type foundation model building understand certain thing done applications. heard foundation model that's driving automated drawing creation. heard foundation model that's driving automated sketch generation sketch constraints. kind stuff bottom-up innovation. bernini top-down type innovation actually specifying thing trying generate preliminary outcome specifications. bernini trying engage certain targeted customer get participate u making bernini smarter intelligent. available commercially right now. getting intelligent. actually successful getting customer stand say, look, yes, like work make intelligent need something actually understands 3d geometry geometry, picture something, ok? so, that's what's going bernini right now, continue see refinement extension moving forward. regard monetization, monetization, nobody know exactly going monetized. there's vector come play. one, ahead competitor space. intend ahead. investing stay ahead. increase one competitive position marketplace, that's really important. also, get able charge incremental feature future. delivering value high-quality outcome result, going charge outcome. charge things? let's play out, ok? still early days. there's also monetization opportunity licensing certain technology specific mature maturation specific customers' needs, right? another avenue. so, avenue play out, one wait more, let play out. need know autodesk ahead. ahead while. first ai research lab six years. published 70 papers. right cutting edge 3d design technology ai, intend stay there. operator thank you. next question come line steve tusa j.p. morgan. question please, steve. stephen tusa -- analyst good evening afternoon. lot good question asked. detailed one. what's change billing contribution transaction model change? five six five five half. simon mays-smith -- vice president, investor relation yeah. so, basically buy/sell business ahead european launch. short answer. so, remember, said 5% 6% launched europe. -- buy sell business, mean there's less tailwind new transaction model. flip side -- mean underlying increase billing guidance greater look headline basis. stephen tusa -- analyst ok, great. thanks lot. operator thank you. next question come line joshua tilton wolfe research. line open. joshua tilton -- analyst hey, guys, hear me? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah. joshua tilton -- analyst great. kind high-level one incoming cfo. heard correctly, exactly get like initial outlook revenue growth next year. trying understand context new cfo coming in, anything could change calculus guy think 10% 15% growth underlying business outside agency transition that's ongoing today. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director well, first, let's talk framework little bit, comment little bit incoming cfo. so, look, 10% 15% growth. right now, pretty much right bottom end range. look back last two years, there's series thing created headwind new business. started thing like pandemic, inflation, exiting russian business, writer's strike, whole trade war within particular geographies. thing accumulated headwind build slowly business pushed u low end range. take time subscription model thing build business, ok?

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Simon Mays-Smith, VP, investor relations. Please go ahead. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Thanks, operator, and good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the third quarter results of Autodesk's fiscal '25. On the line with me is Andrew Anagnost, our CEO; and Betsy Rafael, our interim CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including outlook and related assumptions and on product and strategies. Actual events or results could differ materially. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-Q and the Form 8-K filed with today's press release for important risks and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today. If this call is replayed or reviewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Autodesk disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will quote several numeric or growth changes during this call as we discuss our financial performance. Unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison. All non-GAAP numbers referenced in today's call are reconciled in our press release or Excel financials and other supplemental materials available on our Investor Relations website. And now, I will turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Simon, and welcome, everyone, to the call. We finished the third quarter of the year strongly, delivering 12% revenue growth in constant currency and have again raised full year guidance. This reflects the sustained momentum of the business and successful execution of our strategy, including a smooth implementation of the new transaction model in Western Europe. Once again, opportunity, resilience and discipline underpinned our performance. Last month at Autodesk University in San Diego, we hosted 12,000 registered attendees and another 30,000 online. We showed how granular data in the cloud, organized the data models and connected to everything through APIs to deliver even more valuable and connected solutions for customers and partners and support a much broader ecosystem and marketplace. Customers and channel partners that I spoke with at AU remain cautiously optimistic, a sentiment consistent with the underlying momentum of our business, our growing product usage and BuildingConnected bid activity trends over recent quarters. I left AU with a tremendous sense of purpose and optimism in the ingenuity and persistence of our customers and for the future. On our earnings call last quarter, I set out our secular growth opportunities and our strategy to capitalize on them. I concluded that Autodesk's investment in cloud, platform and AI in pursuit of those opportunities were ahead of its peers. AU was a good demonstration of that. But we're also leading the industry in modernizing our go-to-market motion starting a few years ago with the subscription transition through consumption and self-service enablement and more recently to direct billing. These initiatives enable Autodesk to build larger and more durable direct relationships with its customers and to serve them more efficiently. We have already seen significant benefits from initiatives like these, and there's more to come in the next optimization phase. Taking out the effects on margins from FX and the new transaction model, we still expect to be toward the midpoint of our fiscal '26 non-GAAP operating margin target of 38% to 40% in fiscal '25, a year ahead of schedule. We're confident we will make further improvement in fiscal '26 on the same basis. The new transaction model will enable tighter channel partnerships with less duplication of effort and more digital self-service and automation, which increases customer satisfaction and workforce productivity. It will also create new opportunities for partners Autodesk to earn more with less emphasis on transaction revenue sharing and a greater emphasis on value creation for customers. Once complete, we expect the new transaction model and subsequent go-to-market optimization to increase sales and marketing efficiency and deliver GAAP margins among the best in the industry. Attractive, long-term, secular growth markets, a focused strategy delivering ever more valuable and connected solutions to our customers, and a resilient business are generating strong and sustained momentum, both in absolute terms and relative to peers. Disciplined execution and capital deployment has driven even greater operational velocity and efficiency within Autodesk and will underpin the mechanical build of revenue and free cash flow over the next few years and GAAP margins among the best in the industry. We will continue to deploy capital to offset and buy forward dilution as our free cash flow grows from the fiscal '24 trough. This practice has reduced our share count over the last three years. We have significantly increased our share repurchase authorization to extend this momentum flexibility over the medium term, with the precise trajectory remaining dependent on our debt repayment schedule and the ebb and flow of M&A. In combination, we believe these factors will deliver sustainable shareholder value over many years. Before I conclude, I'd like to formally welcome Janesh to Autodesk. We're excited to welcome Janesh, who brings a wealth of experience and will be instrumental in sustaining Autodesk's growth and enhanced profitability momentum. Of equal importance, I'd like to thank Betsy for stepping in as interim CFO at an important time in the company's journey, and I'm looking forward to continuing to work closely with her as an Autodesk Board member. I will now turn the call over to Betsy to discuss our quarterly financial performance and guidance for the year. I'll then return to provide an update on our strategic growth initiatives. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Andrew. Q3 was another strong quarter. We generated broad-based underlying growth across products and regions. In addition, we saw revenue increases from the new transaction model and M&A which were offset by the absence of enterprise business agreement true-ups from Q3 last year and FX. Our Make products continued to enhance growth, driven by our ongoing strength in construction and Fusion. Overall, macroeconomic policy and geopolitical challenges and the underlying momentum of the business were consistent with the last few quarters, with continued strong renewal rates and headwinds to our new business growth. Total revenue grew 11% and 12% in constant currency. By product, in constant currency, AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT revenue grew 8%. AEC revenue, which was most impacted by the absence of true-up revenues, grew 12%, Manufacturing revenue grew 16% and still comfortably in double digits, excluding upfront revenue. And M&E revenue grew 15% boosted by the PIX acquisition and associated integration adjustments. By region, in constant currency, revenue grew 11% in the Americas which was most impacted by the absence of true-up revenues, 13% in EMEA and 14% in APAC. The mechanical contribution from the new transaction model to revenue was $17 million in the third quarter and $25 million on a year-to-date basis. Direct revenue increased 23% and represented 42% of total revenue, up 4 percentage points from last year, benefiting from strong growth in both EBAs and the Autodesk store and also the natural tailwind to revenue from the new transaction model. Net revenue retention rate remained within the 100% to 110% range at constant exchange rates. Billings increased 28% in the quarter, reflecting a tailwind from the prior-year shift to annual billings for most multiyear contracts, early renewals and the natural tailwind from the transition to the new transaction model. Similar to last quarter, and as expected, co-terming negatively impacted billing ahead of the launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe. The natural contribution from the new transaction model to billing was $72 million in the third quarter and $108 million on a year-to-date basis. Total deferred revenue decreased 9% to $3.7 billion and was again impacted by the transition from upfront to annual billings for multiyear contracts. Total RPO of $6.1 billion and current RPO of $4.0 billion grew 17% and 14%, respectively, which reflects a tailwind from early renewals and the new transaction model and a headwind from the declining contribution of billed and unbilled deferred revenue from large, multiyear and EBA cohorts ahead of renewal in fiscal '26. Excluding these, current RPO growth was broadly consistent with Q2. We do expect the new transaction model and the larger FY '26 renewal cohorts to have a greater impact on both RPO and current RPO growth in Q4 of fiscal '25. Turning to margins. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were broadly low. With Autodesk University shifting back to Q3 this year from Q4 last year, GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins decreased by 2 and 3 percentage points, respectively. The timing effect from AU obviously washes out over the full year. At current course and speed, the ratio of stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue peaked in fiscal '24, will follow by more than a percentage point in fiscal '25 and will be below 10% over time. Free cash flow for the quarter was $199 million. This benefited from some channel partners in Western Europe booking business earlier in the quarter ahead of the transition to the new transaction model really to derisk month one after the transition. This accelerated free cash flow to the third quarter, which was partially offset by the expected negative impact of co-terming in Western Europe. Turning now to capital allocation. We continue to actively manage capital within our framework and deploy it with discipline and focus through the economic cycle to drive long-term shareholder value. As expected, the pace of buybacks picked up in the third quarter. We purchased approximately 1.2 million shares for $319 million at an average price of approximately $269 per share. We will continue to deploy capital to offset and buy forward dilution as our free cash flow grows from the fiscal '24 trough. This practice has reduced our share count by about 5 million shares over the last three years with an average percentage reduction of about 70 basis points per year. We increased the amount authorized under our share repurchase program by $5 billion for a total of approximately $9 billion. This expands our flexibility over the medium term with the precise trajectory remaining dependent on our debt repayment schedule as well as, the ebbs and flow of M&A. Now let me finish with guidance. As we said in the February, the pace of the rollout of the new transaction model will create noise in billings and the P&L. So, we think free cash flow is the best measure of our performance. Taking out that noise, the underlying momentum in the business remains consistent with the expectations embedded in our guidance range for the full year with continued strong renewal rates and headwinds to new business growth. Our sustained momentum in the third quarter and smooth launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe, reduced the likelihood of our more cautious forecast scenario. Given that, we're raising the midpoint of our billing, revenue, margin, earnings per share and free cash flow guidance ranges. So, let me give you a little bit more detail. The underlying momentum of billing is in line with our expectations. Compared to our modeling at the start of the year, the launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe in Q3 and early renewals have been a tailwind for billings, whereas more co-terming, more business done under the old buy-sell model before the launch of the new transaction model and in recent weeks, FX movement have been headwinds for billing. We now estimate that the new transaction model will provide between a 5 and 5.5 percentage point tailwind to billings growth in fiscal '25. We've raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 billings guidance by $10 million to a range of $5.90 billion to $5.98 billion. The underlying momentum of revenue is also in line with our expectations. We estimate the new transaction model will provide around 1 to 1.5 percentage point tailwind to revenue growth in fiscal '25. Upfront revenue contributed 2 percentage points to revenue growth in Q4 of fiscal '24, and therefore, this is a headwind in Q4 of fiscal '25. While not large enough to call out at the start of the year, it was already factored into our Q4 and our full year model. We've raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 revenue guidance range by $18 million to a range of $6.12 billion to $6.13 billion. We're increasing our GAAP and non-GAAP margin guidance midpoint by 25 basis points by raising the bottom end of the ranges by 50 basis points. The GAAP margin guidance range is now 21.5% to 22%. The non-GAAP margin guidance range is now 35.5% to 36%, which includes a 1 to 1.5 percentage point underlying margin improvement, broadly offset by the margin headwinds from the new transaction model and the related incremental investments in people, processes and automation. The underlying momentum of free cash flow is also in line with our expectations. The headwind to billings from co-terming and FX rates that I mentioned earlier, is being offset by early renewals, faster collections and improved underlying margins. We raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 free cash flow guidance by $10 million and tightened the range to $1.47 billion to $1.5 billion. We expect strong free cash flow growth in fiscal '26 because of the return of our largest multiyear renewal cohort the natural mechanical stacking of multiyear contracts billed annually and a larger EBA cohort. With our current trajectory, we still estimate free cash flow in fiscal '26 to be around $2.05 billion at the midpoint. The slide deck on our website has more details on modeling assumptions for Q3 and for the full fiscal year '25. And while this may be my last earnings call for Autodesk, I will stick around for a bit to ensure a smooth transition to Janesh. Thank you, Andrew, and everyone at Autodesk for your support while I was here and to the many investors and the analysts with whom I've had lively discussions over the last few quarters. While the transition to annual billings for multiyear contracts and the deployment of the new transaction model has created noise and billings in the P&L, they do provide a natural near-term tailwind to revenue and free cash flow growth. Combined with a resilient business model, sustained competitive momentum, Autodesk has enviable sources of visibility and certainty to very uncertain world. For all these reasons, I stepped down from my role as interim CFO with tremendous optimism for the future. Andrew, back to you. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Betsy. Let me finish by updating you on our strong progress in the third quarter. We continue to see good momentum in AEC, particularly in infrastructure and construction, fueled by customers consolidating onto our solutions to connect and optimize previously siloed workflows through the cloud. The cornerstone of that growing interest is our comprehensive end-to-end solutions in completing designs, preconstruction, field execution through handover and into operations. This breadth of connected capability enables us to extend our footprint further into infrastructure and construction and also expand our reach into the mid-market. As a sign of our growing momentum as the benefits of our end-to-end solution become more apparent, our construction business continue to perform robustly with net new customers doubling year over year and existing customers' renewal and expansion rates remaining strong. Let me give you a few examples. Power Construction is No. 79 on the Engineering News Record, ENR Top 400 U.S. contractor list. It is a Chicago-based general contractor serving residential and nonresidential end markets. After completing a competitive RFP to replace its legacy project management tool, Power selected Autodesk for its unified construction platform across preconstruction, construction, and DDC. By standardizing on Autodesk Construction Cloud, Power will have a single source of truth for project data, enhanced collaboration capabilities, and streamlined workflows on a single platform. Power Construction was one of two ENR 400 top 100 U.S. contractors that standardized enterprisewide on Autodesk build during the quarter. In Europe, Bouygues, a top 10 ENR 250 international contractor based in France and a leader in sustainable building and infrastructure projects renewed and expanded its EBA in the quarter. Bouygues is continuing to consolidate on Autodesk solutions across the enterprise, including broader adoption of Autodesk Forma, Carbon Insight, and Informed Design to digitize, decarbonize, and industrialize projects. It also significantly increased its commitment to Autodesk Construction Cloud to drive efficiency gains and faster bid response times through better collaboration between design and project teams. Surbana Jurong is No. 23 on ENR's top 225 international design firms. Based in Singapore, it is an urban infrastructure and integrated solutions consulting firm. In Q3, it renewed its third EBA, which included increased investment in Autodesk Construction Cloud and Autodesk Water infrastructure solutions. ACC is helping to scale its operations through increased automation, integrated design workflows and enhanced collaboration across time zones. Our water infrastructure solutions will be a core technology supporting its growth ambitions in planning, designing, engineering and managing water projects for customers worldwide. Again, these stories have a common theme. Managing people, processes and data across the project life cycle to increase efficiency and sustainability while decreasing risk. Over time, we expect the majority of all projects to be managed this way, and we remain focused on enabling that transition through our industry cloud. Moving on to manufacturing. We made excellent progress on our strategic initiatives. Customers continue to invest in their digital transformation and consolidate our Design and Make platform. Fusion remains one of the fastest-growing products in the manufacturing industry. As customers seek to drive innovation and growth at lower cost, Fusion extension attach rates are increasing, which is helping to drive the average sales price higher. For example, in the quarter, a global manufacturer supplying the semiconductor industry selected Fusion Manage and Vault PLM over competitive solutions to foster greater collaboration across manufacturing sites and improve operating efficiency. Once fully scaled and operational, this customer expects to save 105,000 hours per year by connecting people and data, resulting in reduced product development costs and faster time to market. In the U.K., Playdale Playground has been designing, manufacturing, and installing outdoor playground equipment for over 40 years. This quarter, Playdale added Fusion to its existing portfolio of Autodesk solutions, including Inventor, AutoCAD, and Vault to streamline and digitize workflows, optimize production to reduce lead times, reduce nonconformities, and replace inefficient Excel-driven operations on the shop floor. A long time Autodesk customer and global leader in precision engineering solutions renewed and expanded its EBA in the quarter. In addition to Inventor, vault and AutoCAD, it is adopting Fusion's generative design capabilities for material waste reduction and fluid flow optimization and Moldflow to reduce manufacturing costs and defects while increasing mold yields. In education, universities continue to modernize their courses and curriculum to attract and prepare future engineers. For example, from this winter, students at the University of Stuttgart, Institute for Medical Device Technology will use Fusion across six courses. Fusion was selected to replace a competitive solution for its modern platform, ease of use, cloud collaboration capabilities and unique combination of PCB and additive manufacturing workflows in a single team environment. And lastly, we continue to work with our customers to ensure they are using the latest and most secure versions of our software. For example, after a period of rapid scaling and diversification, a large multinational manufacturing company in APAC was looking to align compliance rates across its global employee base. Working collaboratively we address compliance issues while cementing a long-term partnership and completing one of our largest ever license compliance agreements, which included expanded adoption of Alias and VRED for the Design Studio and PDMC for mechanical engineering and rail design. Attractive long-term secular growth markets, a focused strategy delivering ever more valuable and connected solutions to our customers and a resilient business are generating strong and sustained momentum both in absolute terms and relative to peers. Disciplined execution and capital deployment is driving an even greater operational velocity and efficiency within Autodesk, and we continue to deploy capital to deliver sustainable shareholder value over many years. I retain a tremendous sense of purpose and optimism in the ingenuity and persistence of our customers and for the future. Operator, we would now like to open the call up for questions. Questions & Answers: Operator Thank you. [Operator instructions] Again, please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Jason Celino of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your question, please. Jason Celino -- Analyst Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Just two for me. The first one, Andrew. Some of us are unfamiliar with Janesh. Can you just tell us a little bit more about him and what he brings to Autodesk? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director I certainly can. Before I do that, let me make sure that I thank Betsy for everything she brought to Autodesk during this interim period. I really appreciate it. The company appreciates it. Thank you, Betsy. Now we're really excited about Janesh. Let me tell you why we're excited about Janesh. As you remember, one of the things I was telling you that I was looking for was someone that was going to be able to dispassionately drive optimization at scale inside of Autodesk. And what that really means is someone that's going to be really inwardly focused, looking at every dollar that we invest and making sure that we're getting the most return for the business that investors are getting the best return from their business. The next kind of criteria we were looking for, which was nice to have was, time in the seat as a sitting CFO, which was important for us as well. But it was kind of the next nice to have after the optimization at scale. Janesh brings a great balance of both of those things, right? He's been in the seat seven years at Elastic, both CFO and COO, driving some fairly turbulent changes inside of Elastic. So, he's got battle stars from pushing inside the company to get changes done inside, and we like that. We like that a lot. He's also got very good early experience at companies that we feel have always added value to Autodesk. So, he was it VMware in a senior position. He was at Cisco in a senior position. We've had good success bringing people from those kind of companies. He worked at those companies driving optimization at scale, which is the No. 1 criteria I was looking for when we we're driving this work. He also has another nice to have. He's got knowledge of our industry. He spent two years at PTC in his career. He was actually recently on the PTC board. So, he understands our industry, and he'll be able to get up to speed pretty quickly. The No. 1 goal here drive optimization and scale over the next few years, make sure that we're getting everything we need from every dollar we invest, which is a very important theme for Autodesk. And with that, I'm really excited, and I'm looking forward to him joining in December. Jason Celino -- Analyst OK. Great. Interesting. And then for my second question, now that you do have a CFO, do you have any thoughts on when you might hold the next Investor Day? I think in the past, you usually did it in March. Is that a good time frame? Or is that too soon? Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. Well, Janesh is joining in December. I think we need to give him time to get his sea legs on giving time to kind of drive the end of the year and actually get us set up for next fiscal year in good stead. So, I would say it's unlikely we'll be doing anything in the spring, but we'll get back to you on that as soon as Janesh is ready to talk about those things. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Your question, please. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst Thank you. Andrew, as of the third quarter, your three-year CAGR for current RPO is about 12%. How are you thinking about the sustainability or perhaps improvement upon that CAGR or CRPO over the next number of years? When we think about the ingredients of that, it looks like over the last several years, the CAGR for your unit volume for all brands is roughly 6% to 7% in the aggregate. So, on top of that, you've had price and other ingredients, but perhaps talk about how you think you might be able to improve upon the most recent trajectory for current RPO. Then my follow-up. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Hi, Jay, this is Betsy. Let me just give you a couple of things. There's a number of things that are going on, on the headline of the CRPO number. If you first take away the headwinds and the tailwinds was broadly consistent with the second quarter. And as I mentioned in my opening commentary, early renewals and growth with -- and the new transaction model are providing a tailwind. And then there's also a headwind to CRPO growth from the declining contribution of billed and unbilled deferred revenue risk from the large multiyear EBA cohorts coming up for renewal in fiscal '26. And just as a reminder, these are the same larger cohorts we are calling out as the tailwinds to free cash flow for next year. And if you look back to fiscal '22, we saw the same dynamic ahead of the fiscal '23 renewals as well. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst OK. Since new management is part of the news this evening, could you talk about how you're thinking about the chief revenue officer position. Would it make sense perhaps to continue to have a separate CRO? Or do you think it might make more sense perhaps to combine CRO and COO? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, we're going to continue to have a separate CRO because we have various functions that work together there under the COO organization, including our IT organization, our infrastructure and all things associated. What we're looking for in our CRO is someone that understands how to continue to drive a business when you have direct engagement with the customer. So, that means someone that really understands what it takes to analyze self-service patterns, actually understand the data that comes in from the customers to help drive cross-sell and upsell while also transforming a channel from a transactionally focused extension of Autodesk to kind of a solution partner that's driving life cycle solutions for our customers. So, that's the kind of role we're looking for here. And yes, it's going to continue to be a stand-alone CRO role within the COO organization. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Borg of Stifel. Your line is open. Adam Borg -- Analyst Awesome. Thanks so much for taking the questions, and congrats to Betsy and Janesh. Maybe on the new transaction model. I know it's still early. But I was just curious, are there any learnings from those customers that are on the new model that you're seeing in terms of the adoption of Autodesk technology and the ability to find white space to better upsell and cross-sell different solutions now that you have a more direct relationship. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah, Adam, it's really early on to be able to make any kind of conclusions about that. What I can tell you is that we definitely see some shifts to some of the direct channels at Autodesk for customers that were probably just served on a very kind of arm's length kind of transactional level. But in terms of driving cross-sell and upsell, early days, early days. But if you want to get a sense for how that might evolve, we've got experience with our EBAs and our enterprise business agreements. And we've learned over the years that having that kind of relationship with the customer where we really understand their usage patterns, who they are and what they're doing, we are much more effective at driving cross-sell and upsell even when partnering with our channel partners. So, I think those kind of stand as a testament of what's possible as we move forward with completion of the new transaction model. Adam Borg -- Analyst Great. And maybe just as a quick follow-up. Just as we think about the new administration coming in, you talked about the macro being broadly consistent. Any change in tone in your conversations with the end markets in terms of optimism or their ability or willingness to expand new projects ahead of the administration? Any pause or just full steam ahead? I'm just curious, any commentary you have there from a macro perspective would be really, really helpful. Thanks so much. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director What I'll say is the things that matter to our customers are bipartisan things, all right? Our customers care about infrastructure builds out. Both parties care about infrastructure build-outs. Our customers care about domestic manufacturing in Europe, be it in the United States, both parties agree that the domestic manufacturing build-outs are important. Supply chain, independent, supply chain stability. All of these things are bipartisan issues that really affect our customers. So, regardless of the administration, I suspect the things that are important to our customers are continuing to be a focus. Adam Borg -- Analyst Thanks, again. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink of Baird. Please go ahead, Joe. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst Thank you. On the outlook for next year, $2.050 billion in free cash has, I think, been the expectation for the past year now. Within the last year, you've also seen more co-term of contracts. And I think that leads to better billings in FY '26. So, my question is, does that actually create the potential that things are better, and that's why you're qualifying now the $2.050 billion as the midpoint of possibilities. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer There's no change to how we've talked about the free cash flow guide for fiscal '26, it continues to be $2.05 billion at the mid-point. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst OK. Fair enough. And then just on the M&A environment, over recent history, Autodesk has been more in a mode of, I would say, strategic tuck-ins. I think there is actually an asset in the CFD simulation space that was announced during AU in the quarter. Is that the right approach for Autodesk, just given this point in time, all the work you've done to build out the cloud platform, the data models, and so these tuck-ins make the most sense? And if that's true, how would you maybe compare and contrast some of the larger-scale M&A that's happening with your peers in the space? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, look, consolidation in our space is inevitable. I'm not going to comment on any specific deals, but here's what I'll say. Autodesk has always been an acquisitive company, and we will be an inquisitive company when that makes both strategic and financial sense for the company. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst OK. Thank you. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Joe. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Porter of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Elizabeth. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great, thanks so much for the question. As partners are getting customers just up and running on the new transaction model, we picked up that they're spending a little bit more time than usual of time and resources with those existing customers. So, I was curious if that had any impact on new business demand kind of more recently -- and then just more broadly, any change in new business trends that you think you should call out from versus last quarter? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Elizabeth, it's Betsy. And so, just broadly speaking, we continue to see growth, but at a slower pace due to a number of factors really over the last several years, macro, COVID, exiting Russia, elections, and while a drag on the forward momentum of the business, all of that really factored into our guidance. So, I kind of just will leave it at that. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great. And then a follow-up just on billings. I understand there's a lot of volatility around the change from multiyear in the transaction model. But it looks like guidance implies a bigger step down in growth in Q4, just despite easier year-ago compare. So, hoping that you could help us unpack the balance of those headwinds and tailwinds that would drive kind of a greater downtick in growth in Q4. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, again, let me start out with just from a fiscal '25 perspective. Your billing tailwinds are going to be from the final shift to annual billings, new transaction model and early renewals. And you're going to get headwinds from co-terming and business booked ahead of the new transaction model launch and in recent weeks, some FX. So, again, I think that we've continued to perform well as we've executed through through Q3. And so, I think we feel very, very strongly about our expectations for Q4. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bhavin Shah of Deutsche Bank. Your question please, Bhavin. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Great, thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the quarter. Andrew, at university, there appeared to be a noticeable uptick in attendance and sessions geared toward owners and operators. What been driving the recent interest from the segment? How much of it is product enhancements you guys have made versus really more focusing and emphasizing from a go-to-market perspective? And how long before this segment of buyers kind of becomes more meaningful to the financials? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah, Bhavin, that's an excellent question, right. We're very interested in tackling the whole entire life cycle from design, through make, construction, manufacturing, all the way into operations. You're probably aware we have a product called Tandem. And a lot of those sessions were driven by increasing interest and increasing adoption of Tandem, which is a digital twin solution, tightly coupled to our solutions that also has a toolkit that allows people to easily connect sensor data through the digital twin solution. So, you're seeing that uptick because we're directly releasing products and capabilities that are of interest to the owner space. You can expect to see that trend continue over time, and you can expect to see us continue to talk about the owner space, continue to deliver solutions for the owner space and even APIs for the owner space. It's an area of great interest, especially when it comes not only to vertical buildings, but factories and other things that are related to that as well as, infrastructure like what we were doing with some of our water owner solutions. So, yes, owners matter. We're building software for them, and you're going to see more of that. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Super helpful there. And then, Betsy, one for you. Just in terms of the underlying improvement that we've been seeing in the margins, and I know you've called out FX and the transaction model. I know it's very early, but as you think about next year, how do we think about like the impact of FX and the transaction model to kind of the headline operating margins? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, I wish I could give you that answer, but I think that the new CFO would probably have a little bit of a problem with that. So, we'll wait till the end of February to give you more specifics on that. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Fair enough. Thanks for taking may questions. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Good try. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke of Citi. Please go ahead, Tyler. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Yeah, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I was going to ask you about a placeholder for next year's guidance, Betsy. don't want to waste a question on that, but feel free to answer. But Andrew, I wanted to kind of ask you about some of your comments you made around efficiency, especially as it relates to hiring Janesh, who you pointed out has a lot of experience at larger companies, VMware, Cisco, et cetera. Now that you're a few quarters into this transaction model rollout, you have kind of visibility better on some of the channel prior channel relationships, having that direct billing with the customer. What are some of the areas that you've identified as having that efficiency potential? And then as we think about that efficiency unlock, should we think about that as incremental to the free cash flow number you have out for next year? Or is that embedded in that already. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director So, many layers to that question. All right. First, let me kind of answer the question in a series of stages then dodge other ones, OK? So, first off, optimization is kind of a mindset at Autodesk. It's not something that that suddenly happens. I want to reemphasize that because if you look right now, this year, for example, when you look at the apples-to-apples comparison, which will be in the slide decks, are in our disclosed materials you can see that our non-GAAP margins are already hitting the targets we set for next year this year, OK? So, optimization is a mentality. You've also heard me say over and over again as the new transaction model starts to roll out, optimization of our go-to-market efforts is going to be a critical step for us and part of the optimization journey that we're on, that's going to deliver margin growth for the company for couple of years to come, OK? And I think that's important. It's a long-term driver. Now with getting into the specifics, OK? I think the specifics are probably for another time, but let me just kind of give you a sense for some of the things that are important, right? One is the drive to self-service, right? Self-service is a huge impact on how our customers will engage with us and where those customers come from, and that is value accretive to Autodesk, both on an efficiency side, from renewals and other things, but also on the revenue growth side through capturing the customers directly. The other thing I talked about is understanding the customer better, so the upsell and cross-sell. So, we're going to be able to do a lot more automation and understanding about where the opportunities are, and that's going to drive some efficiencies. And we're moving the channel partners away from this model of being the transactional players to being the solution providers and the IP providers to our customers. That's going to have all sorts of opportunities to eliminate duplication of effort and drive real cost efficiencies for the company moving forward. There's both top-line efficiencies here in revenue growth, but there's bottom line efficiencies as well through removing the redundancies and steps that just aren't necessary for the customer. You'll get a lot more clarity on that as you see us continue to move forward with this go-to-market optimization in the next year and beyond that. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Great. And then my follow-up question, Andrew, you talked about some really strong net new customer additions within the Construction Cloud, I think, doubling year over year. we also saw the Make revenue accelerate to 28% constant currency. Can you just help us understand, do you think that reacceleration is durable? And how are you sort of thinking about just your position there? What's been driving that strength in the new customer additions? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director First, let me comment on the make revenues, then I'm going to go into construction. So, the make revenue also includes some revenue from PIX and things associated with that. However, let's talk about the facts around our construction business because I think this is important, right? No. 1 factor is that we continue to drive consistent, high growth in our construction solutions. You're seeing it. It's built into the Make numbers, and it's the lion's share of those Make numbers. You're really seeing some consistent growth there. That's organically. Inorganically, we're actually executing incredibly well on things like Payapps, and that's driving acceleration of our growth. So, we are not decelerating as a business, OK? We are actually performing solidly inorganically, we're accelerating, all right? And I just want to be really clear about that. And yes, we said year over year, we drove a 2x increase in our new customers. And I'll talk about where some of that's coming from in just a minute. But I also want to highlight the other thing that's going on we are strengthening an already strong position in the ENR 400. So, you heard about the story about power construction, which was a great example of someone taking out a competitive RFP and say, look, I need a forward-looking cloud-based solution on new technology that goes end to end from design to construction all the way to operations. And they chose us. And that was just one example that we gave in the opening commentary. So, already a strengthening position in the ENR 400. Now the other qualitative things that are driving some of that new customer growth is we already have our distribution channel operating at scale. In the U.S., this is helping us go down market more effectively, which is allowing us to capture more customers more effectively be places where we weren't before and where others aren't, which is part of driving that. But also, we're already at scale operating internationally with our distribution channel. So, that's driving international growth for us. And that's a really important driver as well as, some of those net new accounts that you're seeing there. And the last thing I'll add that I'm done with construction is that, look, I heard this over and over again at AU, I'm hearing it over and over again from customers in lots of different places. They want the end-to-end solution. They want the licensed version in the cloud, they're placing bets for the next 10 years. They want to go from design to construction to operations, and that's just making our solution more attractive to the market. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo. Your question, please. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Hey, thanks very much. I appreciate you taking the questions. A commentary on the call sounded consistent, but wondering if there are any added details you can provide for us on just the overall macro spend environment and how that's maybe progressing across either key product segments or geos, whatever split you think is more useful. I think what we're trying to get a sense for is if there are any shades of improvement anywhere or if you'd characterize as mainly just consistent over the past couple of quarters. Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Michael, I think the core answer here is consistency, OK? We're seeing consistent trends that we've seen with -- in all the other quarters. There's always puts and takes in a large business like ours, especially ones as divers as ours. But the general tone is consistent with prior quarters. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer And I would just add that there's also been a lot of noise this year from the new transaction model and then obviously, the elections and leading up to that. And so, it's hard to sparse out kind of that particular behavior. So, I think as Andrew said, we call it consistent. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Yeah, tough for us, too. That's why we keep asking. Betsy, congrats on the transition back given you're also on the board. I think it'd be useful to hear you chime in on the hiring of Janesh and maybe just also comment on how you ensure you're able to hand over the reins and keep progress going on the key transitions the company is working through. Thanks. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Per se, I was involved in the process, which was quite extensive in the company and the recruiting of Janesh. And so, we're certainly very excited to have him on board. What I would also say is, obviously, with my experience of being on the board for 11 years as well as, my deep dive into the business over the last six months. One of the reasons I'm staying around until the end of the fiscal year, is I think I could be really helpful in that transition for Janesh. And so, I'm very much looking forward to it. And I think that we have a great finance team, and I think that he's going to fit very well, and I'm looking forward to making that happen as fast as we can. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. Your question, please, Matthew. Mike Richards -- Analyst Hey, guys. This is Mike Richards on for Matt. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could provide an update on Project Bernini and maybe how customer reception has been and where we are in developing other foundational models or just the monetization opportunity there? Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, first off, before I comment on Bernini, as you might have heard from AU, AI is embedded in everything we're doing from a bottom-up and a top-down perspective. And you also heard us talk at AU about new types of foundation models we're building that understand how certain things are done in our applications. You heard about a foundation model that's driving automated drawing creation. You heard about a foundation model that's driving automated sketch generation and sketch constraints. That kind of stuff is bottom-up innovation. Bernini more of a top-down type innovation where you're actually specifying things and trying to generate a preliminary outcome from those specifications. And what we've been doing with Bernini is we've been trying to engage with certain targeted customers to get them to participate with us in making Bernini smarter and more intelligent. It's not available commercially right now. but it's getting more intelligent. We've actually been successful in getting some customers to stand up and say, look, yes, I'd like to work with you to make this more intelligent because we need something that actually understands 3D geometry as geometry, not just in the picture or something, OK? So, that's what's going on with Bernini right now, and you should continue to see refinements and extensions of that moving forward. Now with regard to monetization, monetization, nobody knows exactly how all this is going to be monetized. But there's a few vectors here that that come into play. One, we are ahead of our competitors in this space. We intend to be ahead. We're investing to stay ahead. That increase ones competitive position in the marketplace, and that's really important. Also, you get to be able to charge for some of these incremental features in the future. When you're delivering value or a high-quality outcome as a result, you're going to charge for that outcome. How we charge for those things? Let's just play out, OK? It's still early days. But there's also monetization opportunities through licensing certain technologies for specific mature maturation for specific customers' needs, all right? And that will be another avenue. So, how these avenues play out, which one waits more, let this play out. But what you need to know about Autodesk is we're ahead. We've been ahead for a while. We were the first out there with an AI research lab that been out there for over six years. It's published 70 papers. We're right on the cutting edge of 3D design technology in AI, and we intend to stay there. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of J.P. Morgan. Your question please, Steve. Stephen Tusa -- Analyst Good evening or afternoon. Lots of good questions asked. Just a detailed one. What's the change in the billings contribution from the transaction model change? The five to six to five to five and a half. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Yeah. So, it's basically because we did more buy/sell business ahead of the European launch. It's short answer. So, remember, we said 5% to 6% when we launched Europe. And it was the -- we did more buy sell business, which means there's less tailwind from the new transaction model. The flip side of -- that means that the underlying increase in our billings guidance is greater than it looks on a headline basis. Stephen Tusa -- Analyst OK, great. Thanks a lot. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Tilton of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Hey, guys, can you hear me? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Great. I have a kind of a high-level one on the incoming CFO. If I heard correctly, we didn't exactly get like an initial outlook for revenue growth for next year. And I'm just trying to understand in the context of the new CFO coming in, is there anything that could change the calculus of how you guys think about that 10% to 15% growth for the underlying business outside of the agency transition that's ongoing today. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Well, first, let's talk about that framework a little bit, and then I'll comment a little bit on the incoming CFO. So, look, the 10% to 15% growth. Right now, we're pretty much right at the bottom end of that range. And if we look back over the last two years, there's been a series of things that created headwinds to new business. It started off with things like the pandemic, the inflation, the exiting of the Russian business, the writer's strike, the whole trade wars within particular geographies. All of these things were accumulated headwinds that build slowly into the business and have pushed us down to the low end of the range. it takes time in a subscription model for those things to build out of the business, OK? So, it's going to take time for us to build out of that. That's to be expected with a subscription model. The revenue goes down slowly. It goes back up slowly as headwinds turn into tailwinds. So, expect us to be near the bottom of that range in the short term just as a general kind of guideline for the core business to be at the bottom of the range, OK? As a long-term framework, the 10% to 15% still makes sense as a long-term guide for the company. But of course, as new eyes come in, we'll look at these things, and we'll evaluate them. But right now, this all still makes sense. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Super helpful. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho. Your question, please. Siti Panigrahi -- Analyst Thanks for taking my question. I understand the new business model of some kind of noise in your expense and margin side. But if you exclude that, where do you see some of the operating leverage that you can drive in next year or so? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, I think we've actually provided kind of historically what we've done over the last three years pretty clearly. And I think we said that we continue to be focused on expansion, but nothing further to add as far as next year. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director We did provide data on that. So, you can see what underlying thing is, and we expect to see continued improvement in that same vector. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations On the same basis. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director On the same basis, on the same apples-to-apples basis. Siti Panigrahi -- Analyst OK, great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Funk of Bank of America. Your question, please. Michael Funk -- Analyst Yeah. Guys, thank you for the question tonight. Two, if I could. You've mentioned a few times in the last calls about the largest multiyear cohort renewing next year and then also a large EBA cohort. Just wondering if you can give us kind of the range of potential outcomes among the renewals there, whether a potential to upsell, risk of down sell and what that variance might look like around those renewals? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer No. I mean I think what we have said is that it's the largest cohort and we saw that performance in '23. And so, we expect a strong renewal year, but we're not giving any specific guidance on what that looks like for '26 at this point, and we'll wait until we report earnings in February. Michael Funk -- Analyst OK. Great. And then, Betsy, one more. You've mentioned a few times after the investment in new transaction model, people processes, and automation, presumably more fixed cost versus variable like commission. Can you quantify that for us to help us with modeling as we try to forecast margin? I know you've not given guidance, but better understanding of what that cost might actually be on an absolute basis would help us to think about our modeling. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Mike, we've got a slide in the earnings deck to help you think about modeling. And I'll just point you to that. Michael Funk -- Analyst OK, great. Thank you, Simon. Operator Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for Q&A today. I would now like to turn the conference back to Simon Mays-Smith for closing remarks. Sir? Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Great. Thanks, Latif, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Looking forward to seeing many of you on the road over the next few weeks. If you have any questions in the meantime, please email me or call me. And in the meantime, for those of you in North America wishing you a very happy Thanksgiving. Thank you, Latif.

pause full steam ahead? curious, commentary macro perspective would really, really helpful. thanks much. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director say thing matter customer bipartisan things, right? customer care infrastructure build out. party care infrastructure build-outs. customer care domestic manufacturing europe, united states, party agree domestic manufacturing build-outs important. supply chain, independent, supply chain stability. thing bipartisan issue really affect customers. so, regardless administration, suspect thing important customer continuing focus. adam borg -- analyst thanks, again. operator thank you. next question come line joe vruwink baird. please go ahead, joe. joe vruwink -- analyst thank you. outlook next year, $2.050 billion free cash has, think, expectation past year now. within last year, also seen co-term contracts. think lead better billing fy '26. so, question is, actually create potential thing better, that's qualifying $2.050 billion midpoint possibilities. betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer there's change talked free cash flow guide fiscal '26, continues $2.05 billion mid-point. joe vruwink -- analyst ok. fair enough. m&a environment, recent history, autodesk mode of, would say, strategic tuck-ins. think actually asset cfd simulation space announced au quarter. right approach autodesk, given point time, work done build cloud platform, data models, tuck-ins make sense? that's true, would maybe compare contrast larger-scale m&a that's happening peer space? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah. so, look, consolidation space inevitable. going comment specific deals, here's say. autodesk always acquisitive company, inquisitive company make strategic financial sense company. joe vruwink -- analyst ok. thank you. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director thank you, joe. operator thank you. next question come line elizabeth porter morgan stanley. please go ahead, elizabeth. elizabeth porter -- analyst great, thanks much question. partner getting customer running new transaction model, picked spending little bit time usual time resource existing customers. so, curious impact new business demand kind recently -- broadly, change new business trend think call versus last quarter? betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer yeah. elizabeth, betsy. so, broadly speaking, continue see growth, slower pace due number factor really last several years, macro, covid, exiting russia, elections, drag forward momentum business, really factored guidance. so, kind leave that. elizabeth porter -- analyst great. follow-up billings. understand there's lot volatility around change multiyear transaction model. look like guidance implies bigger step growth q4, despite easier year-ago compare. so, hoping could help u unpack balance headwind tailwind would drive kind greater downtick growth q4. betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer well, again, let start fiscal '25 perspective. billing tailwind going final shift annual billings, new transaction model early renewals. going get headwind co-terming business booked ahead new transaction model launch recent weeks, fx. so, again, think continued perform well executed q3. so, think feel very, strongly expectation q4. elizabeth porter -- analyst great. thank you. operator thank you. next question come line bhavin shah deutsche bank. question please, bhavin. bhavin shah -- analyst great, thanks taking question, congrats quarter. andrew, university, appeared noticeable uptick attendance session geared toward owner operators. driving recent interest segment? much product enhancement guy made versus really focusing emphasizing go-to-market perspective? long segment buyer kind becomes meaningful financials? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah, bhavin, that's excellent question, right. interested tackling whole entire life cycle design, make, construction, manufacturing, way operations. probably aware product called tandem. lot session driven increasing interest increasing adoption tandem, digital twin solution, tightly coupled solution also toolkit allows people easily connect sensor data digital twin solution. so, seeing uptick directly releasing product capability interest owner space. expect see trend continue time, expect see u continue talk owner space, continue deliver solution owner space even apis owner space. area great interest, especially come vertical buildings, factory thing related well as, infrastructure like water owner solutions. so, yes, owner matter. building software them, going see that. bhavin shah -- analyst super helpful there. then, betsy, one you. term underlying improvement seeing margins, know called fx transaction model. know early, think next year, think like impact fx transaction model kind headline operating margins? betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer well, wish could give answer, think new cfo would probably little bit problem that. so, wait till end february give specific that. bhavin shah -- analyst fair enough. thanks taking may questions. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director good try. operator thank you. next question come line tyler radke citi. please go ahead, tyler. tyler radke -- analyst yeah, good afternoon. thanks taking questions. going ask placeholder next year's guidance, betsy. want waste question that, feel free answer. andrew, wanted kind ask comment made around efficiency, especially relates hiring janesh, pointed lot experience larger companies, vmware, cisco, et cetera. quarter transaction model rollout, kind visibility better channel prior channel relationships, direct billing customer. area identified efficiency potential? think efficiency unlock, think incremental free cash flow number next year? embedded already. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director so, many layer question. right. first, let kind answer question series stage dodge ones, ok? so, first off, optimization kind mindset autodesk. something suddenly happens. want reemphasize look right now, year, example, look apples-to-apples comparison, slide decks, disclosed material see non-gaap margin already hitting target set next year year, ok? so, optimization mentality. also heard say new transaction model start roll out, optimization go-to-market effort going critical step u part optimization journey on, that's going deliver margin growth company couple year come, ok? think that's important. long-term driver. getting specifics, ok? think specific probably another time, let kind give sense thing important, right? one drive self-service, right? self-service huge impact customer engage u customer come from, value accretive autodesk, efficiency side, renewal things, also revenue growth side capturing customer directly. thing talked understanding customer better, upsell cross-sell. so, going able lot automation understanding opportunity are, that's going drive efficiencies. moving channel partner away model transactional player solution provider ip provider customers. that's going sort opportunity eliminate duplication effort drive real cost efficiency company moving forward. there's top-line efficiency revenue growth, there's bottom line efficiency well removing redundancy step necessary customer. get lot clarity see u continue move forward go-to-market optimization next year beyond that. tyler radke -- analyst great. follow-up question, andrew, talked really strong net new customer addition within construction cloud, think, doubling year year. also saw make revenue accelerate 28% constant currency. help u understand, think reacceleration durable? sort thinking position there? what's driving strength new customer additions? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director first, let comment make revenues, going go construction. so, make revenue also includes revenue pix thing associated that. however, let's talk fact around construction business think important, right? no. 1 factor continue drive consistent, high growth construction solutions. seeing it. built make numbers, lion's share make numbers. really seeing consistent growth there. that's organically. inorganically, actually executing incredibly well thing like payapps, that's driving acceleration growth. so, decelerating business, ok? actually performing solidly inorganically, accelerating, right? want really clear that. yes, said year year, drove 2x increase new customers. talk that's coming minute. also want highlight thing that's going strengthening already strong position enr 400. so, heard story power construction, great example someone taking competitive rfp say, look, need forward-looking cloud-based solution new technology go end end design construction way operations. chose us. one example gave opening commentary. so, already strengthening position enr 400. qualitative thing driving new customer growth already distribution channel operating scale. u.s., helping u go market effectively, allowing u capture customer effectively place others aren't, part driving that. also, already scale operating internationally distribution channel. so, that's driving international growth us. that's really important driver well as, net new account seeing there. last thing add done construction that, look, heard au, hearing customer lot different places. want end-to-end solution. want licensed version cloud, placing bet next 10 years. want go design construction operations, that's making solution attractive market. operator thank you. next question come line michael turrin well fargo. question, please. michael turrin -- analyst hey, thanks much. appreciate taking questions. commentary call sounded consistent, wondering added detail provide u overall macro spend environment that's maybe progressing across either key product segment geos, whatever split think useful. think trying get sense shade improvement anywhere characterize mainly consistent past couple quarters. thanks. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director michael, think core answer consistency, ok?

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Simon Mays-Smith, VP, investor relations. Please go ahead. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Thanks, operator, and good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the third quarter results of Autodesk's fiscal '25.

Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-Q and the Form 8-K filed with today's press release for important risks and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today. If this call is replayed or reviewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Autodesk disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will quote several numeric or growth changes during this call as we discuss our financial performance. Unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison. All non-GAAP numbers referenced in today's call are reconciled in our press release or Excel financials and other supplemental materials available on our Investor Relations website. And now, I will turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Simon, and welcome, everyone, to the call. We finished the third quarter of the year strongly, delivering 12% revenue growth in constant currency and have again raised full year guidance. This reflects the sustained momentum of the business and successful execution of our strategy, including a smooth implementation of the new transaction model in Western Europe. Once again, opportunity, resilience and discipline underpinned our performance. Last month at Autodesk University in San Diego, we hosted 12,000 registered attendees and another 30,000 online. We showed how granular data in the cloud, organized the data models and connected to everything through APIs to deliver even more valuable and connected solutions for customers and partners and support a much broader ecosystem and marketplace. Customers and channel partners that I spoke with at AU remain cautiously optimistic, a sentiment consistent with the underlying momentum of our business, our growing product usage and BuildingConnected bid activity trends over recent quarters. I left AU with a tremendous sense of purpose and optimism in the ingenuity and persistence of our customers and for the future. On our earnings call last quarter, I set out our secular growth opportunities and our strategy to capitalize on them. I concluded that Autodesk's investment in cloud, platform and AI in pursuit of those opportunities were ahead of its peers. AU was a good demonstration of that. But we're also leading the industry in modernizing our go-to-market motion starting a few years ago with the subscription transition through consumption and self-service enablement and more recently to direct billing. These initiatives enable Autodesk to build larger and more durable direct relationships with its customers and to serve them more efficiently. We have already seen significant benefits from initiatives like these, and there's more to come in the next optimization phase. Taking out the effects on margins from FX and the new transaction model, we still expect to be toward the midpoint of our fiscal '26 non-GAAP operating margin target of 38% to 40% in fiscal '25, a year ahead of schedule. We're confident we will make further improvement in fiscal '26 on the same basis. The new transaction model will enable tighter channel partnerships with less duplication of effort and more digital self-service and automation, which increases customer satisfaction and workforce productivity. It will also create new opportunities for partners Autodesk to earn more with less emphasis on transaction revenue sharing and a greater emphasis on value creation for customers. Once complete, we expect the new transaction model and subsequent go-to-market optimization to increase sales and marketing efficiency and deliver GAAP margins among the best in the industry. Attractive, long-term, secular growth markets, a focused strategy delivering ever more valuable and connected solutions to our customers, and a resilient business are generating strong and sustained momentum, both in absolute terms and relative to peers. Disciplined execution and capital deployment has driven even greater operational velocity and efficiency within Autodesk and will underpin the mechanical build of revenue and free cash flow over the next few years and GAAP margins among the best in the industry. We will continue to deploy capital to offset and buy forward dilution as our free cash flow grows from the fiscal '24 trough. This practice has reduced our share count over the last three years. We have significantly increased our share repurchase authorization to extend this momentum flexibility over the medium term, with the precise trajectory remaining dependent on our debt repayment schedule and the ebb and flow of M&A. In combination, we believe these factors will deliver sustainable shareholder value over many years. Before I conclude, I'd like to formally welcome Janesh to Autodesk. We're excited to welcome Janesh, who brings a wealth of experience and will be instrumental in sustaining Autodesk's growth and enhanced profitability momentum. Of equal importance, I'd like to thank Betsy for stepping in as interim CFO at an important time in the company's journey, and I'm looking forward to continuing to work closely with her as an Autodesk Board member. I will now turn the call over to Betsy to discuss our quarterly financial performance and guidance for the year. I'll then return to provide an update on our strategic growth initiatives. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Andrew. Q3 was another strong quarter. We generated broad-based underlying growth across products and regions. In addition, we saw revenue increases from the new transaction model and M&A which were offset by the absence of enterprise business agreement true-ups from Q3 last year and FX. Our Make products continued to enhance growth, driven by our ongoing strength in construction and Fusion. Overall, macroeconomic policy and geopolitical challenges and the underlying momentum of the business were consistent with the last few quarters, with continued strong renewal rates and headwinds to our new business growth. Total revenue grew 11% and 12% in constant currency. By product, in constant currency, AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT revenue grew 8%. AEC revenue, which was most impacted by the absence of true-up revenues, grew 12%, Manufacturing revenue grew 16% and still comfortably in double digits, excluding upfront revenue. And M&E revenue grew 15% boosted by the PIX acquisition and associated integration adjustments. By region, in constant currency, revenue grew 11% in the Americas which was most impacted by the absence of true-up revenues, 13% in EMEA and 14% in APAC. The mechanical contribution from the new transaction model to revenue was $17 million in the third quarter and $25 million on a year-to-date basis. Direct revenue increased 23% and represented 42% of total revenue, up 4 percentage points from last year, benefiting from strong growth in both EBAs and the Autodesk store and also the natural tailwind to revenue from the new transaction model. Net revenue retention rate remained within the 100% to 110% range at constant exchange rates. Billings increased 28% in the quarter, reflecting a tailwind from the prior-year shift to annual billings for most multiyear contracts, early renewals and the natural tailwind from the transition to the new transaction model. Similar to last quarter, and as expected, co-terming negatively impacted billing ahead of the launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe. The natural contribution from the new transaction model to billing was $72 million in the third quarter and $108 million on a year-to-date basis. Total deferred revenue decreased 9% to $3.7 billion and was again impacted by the transition from upfront to annual billings for multiyear contracts. Total RPO of $6.1 billion and current RPO of $4.0 billion grew 17% and 14%, respectively, which reflects a tailwind from early renewals and the new transaction model and a headwind from the declining contribution of billed and unbilled deferred revenue from large, multiyear and EBA cohorts ahead of renewal in fiscal '26. Excluding these, current RPO growth was broadly consistent with Q2. We do expect the new transaction model and the larger FY '26 renewal cohorts to have a greater impact on both RPO and current RPO growth in Q4 of fiscal '25. Turning to margins. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were broadly low. With Autodesk University shifting back to Q3 this year from Q4 last year, GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins decreased by 2 and 3 percentage points, respectively. The timing effect from AU obviously washes out over the full year. At current course and speed, the ratio of stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue peaked in fiscal '24, will follow by more than a percentage point in fiscal '25 and will be below 10% over time. Free cash flow for the quarter was $199 million. This benefited from some channel partners in Western Europe booking business earlier in the quarter ahead of the transition to the new transaction model really to derisk month one after the transition. This accelerated free cash flow to the third quarter, which was partially offset by the expected negative impact of co-terming in Western Europe. Turning now to capital allocation. We continue to actively manage capital within our framework and deploy it with discipline and focus through the economic cycle to drive long-term shareholder value. As expected, the pace of buybacks picked up in the third quarter. We purchased approximately 1.2 million shares for $319 million at an average price of approximately $269 per share. We will continue to deploy capital to offset and buy forward dilution as our free cash flow grows from the fiscal '24 trough. This practice has reduced our share count by about 5 million shares over the last three years with an average percentage reduction of about 70 basis points per year. We increased the amount authorized under our share repurchase program by $5 billion for a total of approximately $9 billion. This expands our flexibility over the medium term with the precise trajectory remaining dependent on our debt repayment schedule as well as, the ebbs and flow of M&A. Now let me finish with guidance. As we said in the February, the pace of the rollout of the new transaction model will create noise in billings and the P&L. So, we think free cash flow is the best measure of our performance. Taking out that noise, the underlying momentum in the business remains consistent with the expectations embedded in our guidance range for the full year with continued strong renewal rates and headwinds to new business growth. Our sustained momentum in the third quarter and smooth launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe, reduced the likelihood of our more cautious forecast scenario. Given that, we're raising the midpoint of our billing, revenue, margin, earnings per share and free cash flow guidance ranges. So, let me give you a little bit more detail. The underlying momentum of billing is in line with our expectations. Compared to our modeling at the start of the year, the launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe in Q3 and early renewals have been a tailwind for billings, whereas more co-terming, more business done under the old buy-sell model before the launch of the new transaction model and in recent weeks, FX movement have been headwinds for billing. We now estimate that the new transaction model will provide between a 5 and 5.5 percentage point tailwind to billings growth in fiscal '25. We've raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 billings guidance by $10 million to a range of $5.90 billion to $5.98 billion. The underlying momentum of revenue is also in line with our expectations. We estimate the new transaction model will provide around 1 to 1.5 percentage point tailwind to revenue growth in fiscal '25. Upfront revenue contributed 2 percentage points to revenue growth in Q4 of fiscal '24, and therefore, this is a headwind in Q4 of fiscal '25. While not large enough to call out at the start of the year, it was already factored into our Q4 and our full year model. We've raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 revenue guidance range by $18 million to a range of $6.12 billion to $6.13 billion. We're increasing our GAAP and non-GAAP margin guidance midpoint by 25 basis points by raising the bottom end of the ranges by 50 basis points. The GAAP margin guidance range is now 21.5% to 22%. The non-GAAP margin guidance range is now 35.5% to 36%, which includes a 1 to 1.5 percentage point underlying margin improvement, broadly offset by the margin headwinds from the new transaction model and the related incremental investments in people, processes and automation. The underlying momentum of free cash flow is also in line with our expectations. The headwind to billings from co-terming and FX rates that I mentioned earlier, is being offset by early renewals, faster collections and improved underlying margins. We raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 free cash flow guidance by $10 million and tightened the range to $1.47 billion to $1.5 billion. We expect strong free cash flow growth in fiscal '26 because of the return of our largest multiyear renewal cohort the natural mechanical stacking of multiyear contracts billed annually and a larger EBA cohort. With our current trajectory, we still estimate free cash flow in fiscal '26 to be around $2.05 billion at the midpoint. The slide deck on our website has more details on modeling assumptions for Q3 and for the full fiscal year '25. And while this may be my last earnings call for Autodesk, I will stick around for a bit to ensure a smooth transition to Janesh. Thank you, Andrew, and everyone at Autodesk for your support while I was here and to the many investors and the analysts with whom I've had lively discussions over the last few quarters. While the transition to annual billings for multiyear contracts and the deployment of the new transaction model has created noise and billings in the P&L, they do provide a natural near-term tailwind to revenue and free cash flow growth. Combined with a resilient business model, sustained competitive momentum, Autodesk has enviable sources of visibility and certainty to very uncertain world. For all these reasons, I stepped down from my role as interim CFO with tremendous optimism for the future. Andrew, back to you. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Betsy. Let me finish by updating you on our strong progress in the third quarter. We continue to see good momentum in AEC, particularly in infrastructure and construction, fueled by customers consolidating onto our solutions to connect and optimize previously siloed workflows through the cloud. The cornerstone of that growing interest is our comprehensive end-to-end solutions in completing designs, preconstruction, field execution through handover and into operations. This breadth of connected capability enables us to extend our footprint further into infrastructure and construction and also expand our reach into the mid-market. As a sign of our growing momentum as the benefits of our end-to-end solution become more apparent, our construction business continue to perform robustly with net new customers doubling year over year and existing customers' renewal and expansion rates remaining strong. Let me give you a few examples. Power Construction is No. 79 on the Engineering News Record, ENR Top 400 U.S. contractor list. It is a Chicago-based general contractor serving residential and nonresidential end markets. After completing a competitive RFP to replace its legacy project management tool, Power selected Autodesk for its unified construction platform across preconstruction, construction, and DDC. By standardizing on Autodesk Construction Cloud, Power will have a single source of truth for project data, enhanced collaboration capabilities, and streamlined workflows on a single platform. Power Construction was one of two ENR 400 top 100 U.S. contractors that standardized enterprisewide on Autodesk build during the quarter. In Europe, Bouygues, a top 10 ENR 250 international contractor based in France and a leader in sustainable building and infrastructure projects renewed and expanded its EBA in the quarter. Bouygues is continuing to consolidate on Autodesk solutions across the enterprise, including broader adoption of Autodesk Forma, Carbon Insight, and Informed Design to digitize, decarbonize, and industrialize projects. It also significantly increased its commitment to Autodesk Construction Cloud to drive efficiency gains and faster bid response times through better collaboration between design and project teams. Surbana Jurong is No. 23 on ENR's top 225 international design firms. Based in Singapore, it is an urban infrastructure and integrated solutions consulting firm. In Q3, it renewed its third EBA, which included increased investment in Autodesk Construction Cloud and Autodesk Water infrastructure solutions. ACC is helping to scale its operations through increased automation, integrated design workflows and enhanced collaboration across time zones. Our water infrastructure solutions will be a core technology supporting its growth ambitions in planning, designing, engineering and managing water projects for customers worldwide. Again, these stories have a common theme. Managing people, processes and data across the project life cycle to increase efficiency and sustainability while decreasing risk. Over time, we expect the majority of all projects to be managed this way, and we remain focused on enabling that transition through our industry cloud. Moving on to manufacturing. We made excellent progress on our strategic initiatives. Customers continue to invest in their digital transformation and consolidate our Design and Make platform. Fusion remains one of the fastest-growing products in the manufacturing industry. As customers seek to drive innovation and growth at lower cost, Fusion extension attach rates are increasing, which is helping to drive the average sales price higher. For example, in the quarter, a global manufacturer supplying the semiconductor industry selected Fusion Manage and Vault PLM over competitive solutions to foster greater collaboration across manufacturing sites and improve operating efficiency. Once fully scaled and operational, this customer expects to save 105,000 hours per year by connecting people and data, resulting in reduced product development costs and faster time to market. In the U.K., Playdale Playground has been designing, manufacturing, and installing outdoor playground equipment for over 40 years. This quarter, Playdale added Fusion to its existing portfolio of Autodesk solutions, including Inventor, AutoCAD, and Vault to streamline and digitize workflows, optimize production to reduce lead times, reduce nonconformities, and replace inefficient Excel-driven operations on the shop floor. A long time Autodesk customer and global leader in precision engineering solutions renewed and expanded its EBA in the quarter. In addition to Inventor, vault and AutoCAD, it is adopting Fusion's generative design capabilities for material waste reduction and fluid flow optimization and Moldflow to reduce manufacturing costs and defects while increasing mold yields. In education, universities continue to modernize their courses and curriculum to attract and prepare future engineers. For example, from this winter, students at the University of Stuttgart, Institute for Medical Device Technology will use Fusion across six courses. Fusion was selected to replace a competitive solution for its modern platform, ease of use, cloud collaboration capabilities and unique combination of PCB and additive manufacturing workflows in a single team environment. And lastly, we continue to work with our customers to ensure they are using the latest and most secure versions of our software. For example, after a period of rapid scaling and diversification, a large multinational manufacturing company in APAC was looking to align compliance rates across its global employee base. Working collaboratively we address compliance issues while cementing a long-term partnership and completing one of our largest ever license compliance agreements, which included expanded adoption of Alias and VRED for the Design Studio and PDMC for mechanical engineering and rail design. Attractive long-term secular growth markets, a focused strategy delivering ever more valuable and connected solutions to our customers and a resilient business are generating strong and sustained momentum both in absolute terms and relative to peers. Disciplined execution and capital deployment is driving an even greater operational velocity and efficiency within Autodesk, and we continue to deploy capital to deliver sustainable shareholder value over many years. I retain a tremendous sense of purpose and optimism in the ingenuity and persistence of our customers and for the future. Operator, we would now like to open the call up for questions. Questions & Answers: Operator Thank you. [Operator instructions] Again, please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Jason Celino of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your question, please. Jason Celino -- Analyst Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Just two for me. The first one, Andrew. Some of us are unfamiliar with Janesh. Can you just tell us a little bit more about him and what he brings to Autodesk? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director I certainly can. Before I do that, let me make sure that I thank Betsy for everything she brought to Autodesk during this interim period. I really appreciate it. The company appreciates it. Thank you, Betsy. Now we're really excited about Janesh. Let me tell you why we're excited about Janesh. As you remember, one of the things I was telling you that I was looking for was someone that was going to be able to dispassionately drive optimization at scale inside of Autodesk. And what that really means is someone that's going to be really inwardly focused, looking at every dollar that we invest and making sure that we're getting the most return for the business that investors are getting the best return from their business. The next kind of criteria we were looking for, which was nice to have was, time in the seat as a sitting CFO, which was important for us as well. But it was kind of the next nice to have after the optimization at scale. Janesh brings a great balance of both of those things, right? He's been in the seat seven years at Elastic, both CFO and COO, driving some fairly turbulent changes inside of Elastic. So, he's got battle stars from pushing inside the company to get changes done inside, and we like that. We like that a lot. He's also got very good early experience at companies that we feel have always added value to Autodesk. So, he was it VMware in a senior position. He was at Cisco in a senior position. We've had good success bringing people from those kind of companies. He worked at those companies driving optimization at scale, which is the No. 1 criteria I was looking for when we we're driving this work. He also has another nice to have. He's got knowledge of our industry. He spent two years at PTC in his career. He was actually recently on the PTC board. So, he understands our industry, and he'll be able to get up to speed pretty quickly. The No. 1 goal here drive optimization and scale over the next few years, make sure that we're getting everything we need from every dollar we invest, which is a very important theme for Autodesk. And with that, I'm really excited, and I'm looking forward to him joining in December. Jason Celino -- Analyst OK. Great. Interesting. And then for my second question, now that you do have a CFO, do you have any thoughts on when you might hold the next Investor Day? I think in the past, you usually did it in March. Is that a good time frame? Or is that too soon? Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. Well, Janesh is joining in December. I think we need to give him time to get his sea legs on giving time to kind of drive the end of the year and actually get us set up for next fiscal year in good stead. So, I would say it's unlikely we'll be doing anything in the spring, but we'll get back to you on that as soon as Janesh is ready to talk about those things. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Your question, please. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst Thank you. Andrew, as of the third quarter, your three-year CAGR for current RPO is about 12%. How are you thinking about the sustainability or perhaps improvement upon that CAGR or CRPO over the next number of years? When we think about the ingredients of that, it looks like over the last several years, the CAGR for your unit volume for all brands is roughly 6% to 7% in the aggregate. So, on top of that, you've had price and other ingredients, but perhaps talk about how you think you might be able to improve upon the most recent trajectory for current RPO. Then my follow-up. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Hi, Jay, this is Betsy. Let me just give you a couple of things. There's a number of things that are going on, on the headline of the CRPO number. If you first take away the headwinds and the tailwinds was broadly consistent with the second quarter. And as I mentioned in my opening commentary, early renewals and growth with -- and the new transaction model are providing a tailwind. And then there's also a headwind to CRPO growth from the declining contribution of billed and unbilled deferred revenue risk from the large multiyear EBA cohorts coming up for renewal in fiscal '26. And just as a reminder, these are the same larger cohorts we are calling out as the tailwinds to free cash flow for next year. And if you look back to fiscal '22, we saw the same dynamic ahead of the fiscal '23 renewals as well. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst OK. Since new management is part of the news this evening, could you talk about how you're thinking about the chief revenue officer position. Would it make sense perhaps to continue to have a separate CRO? Or do you think it might make more sense perhaps to combine CRO and COO? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, we're going to continue to have a separate CRO because we have various functions that work together there under the COO organization, including our IT organization, our infrastructure and all things associated. What we're looking for in our CRO is someone that understands how to continue to drive a business when you have direct engagement with the customer. So, that means someone that really understands what it takes to analyze self-service patterns, actually understand the data that comes in from the customers to help drive cross-sell and upsell while also transforming a channel from a transactionally focused extension of Autodesk to kind of a solution partner that's driving life cycle solutions for our customers. So, that's the kind of role we're looking for here. And yes, it's going to continue to be a stand-alone CRO role within the COO organization. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Borg of Stifel. Your line is open. Adam Borg -- Analyst Awesome. Thanks so much for taking the questions, and congrats to Betsy and Janesh. Maybe on the new transaction model. I know it's still early. But I was just curious, are there any learnings from those customers that are on the new model that you're seeing in terms of the adoption of Autodesk technology and the ability to find white space to better upsell and cross-sell different solutions now that you have a more direct relationship. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah, Adam, it's really early on to be able to make any kind of conclusions about that. What I can tell you is that we definitely see some shifts to some of the direct channels at Autodesk for customers that were probably just served on a very kind of arm's length kind of transactional level. But in terms of driving cross-sell and upsell, early days, early days. But if you want to get a sense for how that might evolve, we've got experience with our EBAs and our enterprise business agreements. And we've learned over the years that having that kind of relationship with the customer where we really understand their usage patterns, who they are and what they're doing, we are much more effective at driving cross-sell and upsell even when partnering with our channel partners. So, I think those kind of stand as a testament of what's possible as we move forward with completion of the new transaction model. Adam Borg -- Analyst Great. And maybe just as a quick follow-up. Just as we think about the new administration coming in, you talked about the macro being broadly consistent. Any change in tone in your conversations with the end markets in terms of optimism or their ability or willingness to expand new projects ahead of the administration? Any pause or just full steam ahead? I'm just curious, any commentary you have there from a macro perspective would be really, really helpful. Thanks so much. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director What I'll say is the things that matter to our customers are bipartisan things, all right? Our customers care about infrastructure builds out. Both parties care about infrastructure build-outs. Our customers care about domestic manufacturing in Europe, be it in the United States, both parties agree that the domestic manufacturing build-outs are important. Supply chain, independent, supply chain stability. All of these things are bipartisan issues that really affect our customers. So, regardless of the administration, I suspect the things that are important to our customers are continuing to be a focus. Adam Borg -- Analyst Thanks, again. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink of Baird. Please go ahead, Joe. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst Thank you. On the outlook for next year, $2.050 billion in free cash has, I think, been the expectation for the past year now. Within the last year, you've also seen more co-term of contracts. And I think that leads to better billings in FY '26. So, my question is, does that actually create the potential that things are better, and that's why you're qualifying now the $2.050 billion as the midpoint of possibilities. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer There's no change to how we've talked about the free cash flow guide for fiscal '26, it continues to be $2.05 billion at the mid-point. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst OK. Fair enough. And then just on the M&A environment, over recent history, Autodesk has been more in a mode of, I would say, strategic tuck-ins. I think there is actually an asset in the CFD simulation space that was announced during AU in the quarter. Is that the right approach for Autodesk, just given this point in time, all the work you've done to build out the cloud platform, the data models, and so these tuck-ins make the most sense? And if that's true, how would you maybe compare and contrast some of the larger-scale M&A that's happening with your peers in the space? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, look, consolidation in our space is inevitable. I'm not going to comment on any specific deals, but here's what I'll say. Autodesk has always been an acquisitive company, and we will be an inquisitive company when that makes both strategic and financial sense for the company. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst OK. Thank you. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Joe. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Porter of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Elizabeth. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great, thanks so much for the question. As partners are getting customers just up and running on the new transaction model, we picked up that they're spending a little bit more time than usual of time and resources with those existing customers. So, I was curious if that had any impact on new business demand kind of more recently -- and then just more broadly, any change in new business trends that you think you should call out from versus last quarter? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Elizabeth, it's Betsy. And so, just broadly speaking, we continue to see growth, but at a slower pace due to a number of factors really over the last several years, macro, COVID, exiting Russia, elections, and while a drag on the forward momentum of the business, all of that really factored into our guidance. So, I kind of just will leave it at that. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great. And then a follow-up just on billings. I understand there's a lot of volatility around the change from multiyear in the transaction model. But it looks like guidance implies a bigger step down in growth in Q4, just despite easier year-ago compare. So, hoping that you could help us unpack the balance of those headwinds and tailwinds that would drive kind of a greater downtick in growth in Q4. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, again, let me start out with just from a fiscal '25 perspective. Your billing tailwinds are going to be from the final shift to annual billings, new transaction model and early renewals. And you're going to get headwinds from co-terming and business booked ahead of the new transaction model launch and in recent weeks, some FX. So, again, I think that we've continued to perform well as we've executed through through Q3. And so, I think we feel very, very strongly about our expectations for Q4. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bhavin Shah of Deutsche Bank. Your question please, Bhavin. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Great, thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the quarter. Andrew, at university, there appeared to be a noticeable uptick in attendance and sessions geared toward owners and operators. What been driving the recent interest from the segment? How much of it is product enhancements you guys have made versus really more focusing and emphasizing from a go-to-market perspective? And how long before this segment of buyers kind of becomes more meaningful to the financials? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah, Bhavin, that's an excellent question, right. We're very interested in tackling the whole entire life cycle from design, through make, construction, manufacturing, all the way into operations. You're probably aware we have a product called Tandem. And a lot of those sessions were driven by increasing interest and increasing adoption of Tandem, which is a digital twin solution, tightly coupled to our solutions that also has a toolkit that allows people to easily connect sensor data through the digital twin solution. So, you're seeing that uptick because we're directly releasing products and capabilities that are of interest to the owner space. You can expect to see that trend continue over time, and you can expect to see us continue to talk about the owner space, continue to deliver solutions for the owner space and even APIs for the owner space. It's an area of great interest, especially when it comes not only to vertical buildings, but factories and other things that are related to that as well as, infrastructure like what we were doing with some of our water owner solutions. So, yes, owners matter. We're building software for them, and you're going to see more of that. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Super helpful there. And then, Betsy, one for you. Just in terms of the underlying improvement that we've been seeing in the margins, and I know you've called out FX and the transaction model. I know it's very early, but as you think about next year, how do we think about like the impact of FX and the transaction model to kind of the headline operating margins? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, I wish I could give you that answer, but I think that the new CFO would probably have a little bit of a problem with that. So, we'll wait till the end of February to give you more specifics on that. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Fair enough. Thanks for taking may questions. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Good try. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke of Citi. Please go ahead, Tyler. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Yeah, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I was going to ask you about a placeholder for next year's guidance, Betsy. don't want to waste a question on that, but feel free to answer. But Andrew, I wanted to kind of ask you about some of your comments you made around efficiency, especially as it relates to hiring Janesh, who you pointed out has a lot of experience at larger companies, VMware, Cisco, et cetera. Now that you're a few quarters into this transaction model rollout, you have kind of visibility better on some of the channel prior channel relationships, having that direct billing with the customer. What are some of the areas that you've identified as having that efficiency potential? And then as we think about that efficiency unlock, should we think about that as incremental to the free cash flow number you have out for next year? Or is that embedded in that already. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director So, many layers to that question. All right. First, let me kind of answer the question in a series of stages then dodge other ones, OK? So, first off, optimization is kind of a mindset at Autodesk. It's not something that that suddenly happens. I want to reemphasize that because if you look right now, this year, for example, when you look at the apples-to-apples comparison, which will be in the slide decks, are in our disclosed materials you can see that our non-GAAP margins are already hitting the targets we set for next year this year, OK? So, optimization is a mentality. You've also heard me say over and over again as the new transaction model starts to roll out, optimization of our go-to-market efforts is going to be a critical step for us and part of the optimization journey that we're on, that's going to deliver margin growth for the company for couple of years to come, OK? And I think that's important. It's a long-term driver. Now with getting into the specifics, OK? I think the specifics are probably for another time, but let me just kind of give you a sense for some of the things that are important, right? One is the drive to self-service, right? Self-service is a huge impact on how our customers will engage with us and where those customers come from, and that is value accretive to Autodesk, both on an efficiency side, from renewals and other things, but also on the revenue growth side through capturing the customers directly. The other thing I talked about is understanding the customer better, so the upsell and cross-sell. So, we're going to be able to do a lot more automation and understanding about where the opportunities are, and that's going to drive some efficiencies. And we're moving the channel partners away from this model of being the transactional players to being the solution providers and the IP providers to our customers. That's going to have all sorts of opportunities to eliminate duplication of effort and drive real cost efficiencies for the company moving forward. There's both top-line efficiencies here in revenue growth, but there's bottom line efficiencies as well through removing the redundancies and steps that just aren't necessary for the customer. You'll get a lot more clarity on that as you see us continue to move forward with this go-to-market optimization in the next year and beyond that. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Great. And then my follow-up question, Andrew, you talked about some really strong net new customer additions within the Construction Cloud, I think, doubling year over year. we also saw the Make revenue accelerate to 28% constant currency. Can you just help us understand, do you think that reacceleration is durable? And how are you sort of thinking about just your position there? What's been driving that strength in the new customer additions? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director First, let me comment on the make revenues, then I'm going to go into construction. So, the make revenue also includes some revenue from PIX and things associated with that. However, let's talk about the facts around our construction business because I think this is important, right? No. 1 factor is that we continue to drive consistent, high growth in our construction solutions. You're seeing it. It's built into the Make numbers, and it's the lion's share of those Make numbers. You're really seeing some consistent growth there. That's organically. Inorganically, we're actually executing incredibly well on things like Payapps, and that's driving acceleration of our growth. So, we are not decelerating as a business, OK? We are actually performing solidly inorganically, we're accelerating, all right? And I just want to be really clear about that. And yes, we said year over year, we drove a 2x increase in our new customers. And I'll talk about where some of that's coming from in just a minute. But I also want to highlight the other thing that's going on we are strengthening an already strong position in the ENR 400. So, you heard about the story about power construction, which was a great example of someone taking out a competitive RFP and say, look, I need a forward-looking cloud-based solution on new technology that goes end to end from design to construction all the way to operations. And they chose us. And that was just one example that we gave in the opening commentary. So, already a strengthening position in the ENR 400. Now the other qualitative things that are driving some of that new customer growth is we already have our distribution channel operating at scale. In the U.S., this is helping us go down market more effectively, which is allowing us to capture more customers more effectively be places where we weren't before and where others aren't, which is part of driving that. But also, we're already at scale operating internationally with our distribution channel. So, that's driving international growth for us. And that's a really important driver as well as, some of those net new accounts that you're seeing there. And the last thing I'll add that I'm done with construction is that, look, I heard this over and over again at AU, I'm hearing it over and over again from customers in lots of different places. They want the end-to-end solution. They want the licensed version in the cloud, they're placing bets for the next 10 years. They want to go from design to construction to operations, and that's just making our solution more attractive to the market. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo. Your question, please. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Hey, thanks very much. I appreciate you taking the questions. A commentary on the call sounded consistent, but wondering if there are any added details you can provide for us on just the overall macro spend environment and how that's maybe progressing across either key product segments or geos, whatever split you think is more useful. I think what we're trying to get a sense for is if there are any shades of improvement anywhere or if you'd characterize as mainly just consistent over the past couple of quarters. Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Michael, I think the core answer here is consistency, OK? We're seeing consistent trends that we've seen with -- in all the other quarters. There's always puts and takes in a large business like ours, especially ones as divers as ours. But the general tone is consistent with prior quarters. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer And I would just add that there's also been a lot of noise this year from the new transaction model and then obviously, the elections and leading up to that. And so, it's hard to sparse out kind of that particular behavior. So, I think as Andrew said, we call it consistent. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Yeah, tough for us, too. That's why we keep asking. Betsy, congrats on the transition back given you're also on the board. I think it'd be useful to hear you chime in on the hiring of Janesh and maybe just also comment on how you ensure you're able to hand over the reins and keep progress going on the key transitions the company is working through. Thanks. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Per se, I was involved in the process, which was quite extensive in the company and the recruiting of Janesh. And so, we're certainly very excited to have him on board. What I would also say is, obviously, with my experience of being on the board for 11 years as well as, my deep dive into the business over the last six months. One of the reasons I'm staying around until the end of the fiscal year, is I think I could be really helpful in that transition for Janesh. And so, I'm very much looking forward to it. And I think that we have a great finance team, and I think that he's going to fit very well, and I'm looking forward to making that happen as fast as we can. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. Your question, please, Matthew. Mike Richards -- Analyst Hey, guys. This is Mike Richards on for Matt. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could provide an update on Project Bernini and maybe how customer reception has been and where we are in developing other foundational models or just the monetization opportunity there? Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, first off, before I comment on Bernini, as you might have heard from AU, AI is embedded in everything we're doing from a bottom-up and a top-down perspective. And you also heard us talk at AU about new types of foundation models we're building that understand how certain things are done in our applications. You heard about a foundation model that's driving automated drawing creation. You heard about a foundation model that's driving automated sketch generation and sketch constraints. That kind of stuff is bottom-up innovation. Bernini more of a top-down type innovation where you're actually specifying things and trying to generate a preliminary outcome from those specifications. And what we've been doing with Bernini is we've been trying to engage with certain targeted customers to get them to participate with us in making Bernini smarter and more intelligent. It's not available commercially right now. but it's getting more intelligent. We've actually been successful in getting some customers to stand up and say, look, yes, I'd like to work with you to make this more intelligent because we need something that actually understands 3D geometry as geometry, not just in the picture or something, OK? So, that's what's going on with Bernini right now, and you should continue to see refinements and extensions of that moving forward. Now with regard to monetization, monetization, nobody knows exactly how all this is going to be monetized. But there's a few vectors here that that come into play. One, we are ahead of our competitors in this space. We intend to be ahead. We're investing to stay ahead. That increase ones competitive position in the marketplace, and that's really important. Also, you get to be able to charge for some of these incremental features in the future. When you're delivering value or a high-quality outcome as a result, you're going to charge for that outcome. How we charge for those things? Let's just play out, OK? It's still early days. But there's also monetization opportunities through licensing certain technologies for specific mature maturation for specific customers' needs, all right? And that will be another avenue. So, how these avenues play out, which one waits more, let this play out. But what you need to know about Autodesk is we're ahead. We've been ahead for a while. We were the first out there with an AI research lab that been out there for over six years. It's published 70 papers. We're right on the cutting edge of 3D design technology in AI, and we intend to stay there. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of J.P. Morgan. Your question please, Steve. Stephen Tusa -- Analyst Good evening or afternoon. Lots of good questions asked. Just a detailed one. What's the change in the billings contribution from the transaction model change? The five to six to five to five and a half. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Yeah. So, it's basically because we did more buy/sell business ahead of the European launch. It's short answer. So, remember, we said 5% to 6% when we launched Europe. And it was the -- we did more buy sell business, which means there's less tailwind from the new transaction model. The flip side of -- that means that the underlying increase in our billings guidance is greater than it looks on a headline basis. Stephen Tusa -- Analyst OK, great. Thanks a lot. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Tilton of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Hey, guys, can you hear me? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Great. I have a kind of a high-level one on the incoming CFO. If I heard correctly, we didn't exactly get like an initial outlook for revenue growth for next year. And I'm just trying to understand in the context of the new CFO coming in, is there anything that could change the calculus of how you guys think about that 10% to 15% growth for the underlying business outside of the agency transition that's ongoing today. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Well, first, let's talk about that framework a little bit, and then I'll comment a little bit on the incoming CFO. So, look, the 10% to 15% growth. Right now, we're pretty much right at the bottom end of that range. And if we look back over the last two years, there's been a series of things that created headwinds to new business. It started off with things like the pandemic, the inflation, the exiting of the Russian business, the writer's strike, the whole trade wars within particular geographies. All of these things were accumulated headwinds that build slowly into the business and have pushed us down to the low end of the range. it takes time in a subscription model for those things to build out of the business, OK? So, it's going to take time for us to build out of that. That's to be expected with a subscription model. The revenue goes down slowly. It goes back up slowly as headwinds turn into tailwinds. So, expect us to be near the bottom of that range in the short term just as a general kind of guideline for the core business to be at the bottom of the range, OK? As a long-term framework, the 10% to 15% still makes sense as a long-term guide for the company. But of course, as new eyes come in, we'll look at these things, and we'll evaluate them. But right now, this all still makes sense. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Super helpful. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho. Your question, please. Siti Panigrahi -- Analyst Thanks for taking my question. I understand the new business model of some kind of noise in your expense and margin side. But if you exclude that, where do you see some of the operating leverage that you can drive in next year or so? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, I think we've actually provided kind of historically what we've done over the last three years pretty clearly. And I think we said that we continue to be focused on expansion, but nothing further to add as far as next year. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director We did provide data on that. So, you can see what underlying thing is, and we expect to see continued improvement in that same vector. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations On the same basis. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director On the same basis, on the same apples-to-apples basis. Siti Panigrahi -- Analyst OK, great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Funk of Bank of America. Your question, please. Michael Funk -- Analyst Yeah. Guys, thank you for the question tonight. Two, if I could. You've mentioned a few times in the last calls about the largest multiyear cohort renewing next year and then also a large EBA cohort. Just wondering if you can give us kind of the range of potential outcomes among the renewals there, whether a potential to upsell, risk of down sell and what that variance might look like around those renewals? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer No. I mean I think what we have said is that it's the largest cohort and we saw that performance in '23. And so, we expect a strong renewal year, but we're not giving any specific guidance on what that looks like for '26 at this point, and we'll wait until we report earnings in February. Michael Funk -- Analyst OK. Great. And then, Betsy, one more. You've mentioned a few times after the investment in new transaction model, people processes, and automation, presumably more fixed cost versus variable like commission. Can you quantify that for us to help us with modeling as we try to forecast margin? I know you've not given guidance, but better understanding of what that cost might actually be on an absolute basis would help us to think about our modeling. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Mike, we've got a slide in the earnings deck to help you think about modeling. And I'll just point you to that. Michael Funk -- Analyst OK, great. Thank you, Simon. Operator Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for Q&A today. I would now like to turn the conference back to Simon Mays-Smith for closing remarks. Sir? Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Great. Thanks, Latif, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Looking forward to seeing many of you on the road over the next few weeks.

[operator instructions] again, please stand compile q&a roster. first question come line jason celino keybanc capital markets. question, please. jason celino -- analyst hey, thanks taking questions. two me. first one, andrew. u unfamiliar janesh. tell u little bit brings autodesk? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director certainly can. that, let make sure thank betsy everything brought autodesk interim period. really appreciate it. company appreciates it. thank you, betsy. really excited janesh. let tell excited janesh. remember, one thing telling looking someone going able dispassionately drive optimization scale inside autodesk. really mean someone that's going really inwardly focused, looking every dollar invest making sure getting return business investor getting best return business. next kind criterion looking for, nice was, time seat sitting cfo, important u well. kind next nice optimization scale. janesh brings great balance things, right? seat seven year elastic, cfo coo, driving fairly turbulent change inside elastic. so, got battle star pushing inside company get change done inside, like that. like lot. also got good early experience company feel always added value autodesk. so, vmware senior position. cisco senior position. good success bringing people kind companies. worked company driving optimization scale, no. 1 criterion looking driving work. also another nice have. got knowledge industry. spent two year ptc career. actually recently ptc board. so, understands industry, able get speed pretty quickly. no. 1 goal drive optimization scale next years, make sure getting everything need every dollar invest, important theme autodesk. that, really excited, looking forward joining december. jason celino -- analyst ok. great. interesting. second question, cfo, thought might hold next investor day? think past, usually march. good time frame? soon? thanks. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah. well, janesh joining december. think need give time get sea leg giving time kind drive end year actually get u set next fiscal year good stead. so, would say unlikely anything spring, get back soon janesh ready talk things. operator thank you. next question come line jay vleeschhouwer griffin securities. question, please. jay vleeschhouwer -- analyst thank you. andrew, third quarter, three-year cagr current rpo 12%. thinking sustainability perhaps improvement upon cagr crpo next number years? think ingredient that, look like last several years, cagr unit volume brand roughly 6% 7% aggregate. so, top that, price ingredients, perhaps talk think might able improve upon recent trajectory current rpo. follow-up. betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer yeah. hi, jay, betsy. let give couple things. there's number thing going on, headline crpo number. first take away headwind tailwind broadly consistent second quarter. mentioned opening commentary, early renewal growth -- new transaction model providing tailwind. there's also headwind crpo growth declining contribution billed unbilled deferred revenue risk large multiyear eba cohort coming renewal fiscal '26. reminder, larger cohort calling tailwind free cash flow next year. look back fiscal '22, saw dynamic ahead fiscal '23 renewal well. jay vleeschhouwer -- analyst ok. since new management part news evening, could talk thinking chief revenue officer position. would make sense perhaps continue separate cro? think might make sense perhaps combine cro coo? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah. so, going continue separate cro various function work together coo organization, including organization, infrastructure thing associated. looking cro someone understands continue drive business direct engagement customer. so, mean someone really understands take analyze self-service patterns, actually understand data come customer help drive cross-sell upsell also transforming channel transactionally focused extension autodesk kind solution partner that's driving life cycle solution customers. so, that's kind role looking here. yes, going continue stand-alone cro role within coo organization. jay vleeschhouwer -- analyst thank much. operator thank you. next question come line adam borg stifel. line open. adam borg -- analyst awesome. thanks much taking questions, congrats betsy janesh. maybe new transaction model. know still early. curious, learning customer new model seeing term adoption autodesk technology ability find white space better upsell cross-sell different solution direct relationship. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah, adam, really early able make kind conclusion that. tell definitely see shift direct channel autodesk customer probably served kind arm's length kind transactional level. term driving cross-sell upsell, early days, early days. want get sense might evolve, got experience ebas enterprise business agreements. learned year kind relationship customer really understand usage patterns, doing, much effective driving cross-sell upsell even partnering channel partners. so, think kind stand testament what's possible move forward completion new transaction model. adam borg -- analyst great. maybe quick follow-up. think new administration coming in, talked macro broadly consistent. change tone conversation end market term optimism ability willingness expand new project ahead administration? pause full steam ahead? curious, commentary macro perspective would really, really helpful. thanks much. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director say thing matter customer bipartisan things, right? customer care infrastructure build out. party care infrastructure build-outs. customer care domestic manufacturing europe, united states, party agree domestic manufacturing build-outs important. supply chain, independent, supply chain stability. thing bipartisan issue really affect customers. so, regardless administration, suspect thing important customer continuing focus. adam borg -- analyst thanks, again. operator thank you. next question come line joe vruwink baird. please go ahead, joe. joe vruwink -- analyst thank you. outlook next year, $2.050 billion free cash has, think, expectation past year now. within last year, also seen co-term contracts. think lead better billing fy '26. so, question is, actually create potential thing better, that's qualifying $2.050 billion midpoint possibilities. betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer there's change talked free cash flow guide fiscal '26, continues $2.05 billion mid-point. joe vruwink -- analyst ok. fair enough. m&a environment, recent history, autodesk mode of, would say, strategic tuck-ins. think actually asset cfd simulation space announced au quarter. right approach autodesk, given point time, work done build cloud platform, data models, tuck-ins make sense? that's true, would maybe compare contrast larger-scale m&a that's happening peer space? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah. so, look, consolidation space inevitable. going comment specific deals, here's say. autodesk always acquisitive company, inquisitive company make strategic financial sense company. joe vruwink -- analyst ok. thank you. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director thank you, joe. operator thank you. next question come line elizabeth porter morgan stanley. please go ahead, elizabeth. elizabeth porter -- analyst great, thanks much question. partner getting customer running new transaction model, picked spending little bit time usual time resource existing customers. so, curious impact new business demand kind recently -- broadly, change new business trend think call versus last quarter? betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer yeah. elizabeth, betsy. so, broadly speaking, continue see growth, slower pace due number factor really last several years, macro, covid, exiting russia, elections, drag forward momentum business, really factored guidance. so, kind leave that. elizabeth porter -- analyst great. follow-up billings. understand there's lot volatility around change multiyear transaction model. look like guidance implies bigger step growth q4, despite easier year-ago compare. so, hoping could help u unpack balance headwind tailwind would drive kind greater downtick growth q4. betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer well, again, let start fiscal '25 perspective. billing tailwind going final shift annual billings, new transaction model early renewals. going get headwind co-terming business booked ahead new transaction model launch recent weeks, fx. so, again, think continued perform well executed q3. so, think feel very, strongly expectation q4. elizabeth porter -- analyst great. thank you. operator thank you. next question come line bhavin shah deutsche bank. question please, bhavin. bhavin shah -- analyst great, thanks taking question, congrats quarter. andrew, university, appeared noticeable uptick attendance session geared toward owner operators. driving recent interest segment? much product enhancement guy made versus really focusing emphasizing go-to-market perspective? long segment buyer kind becomes meaningful financials? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah, bhavin, that's excellent question, right. interested tackling whole entire life cycle design, make, construction, manufacturing, way operations. probably aware product called tandem. lot session driven increasing interest increasing adoption tandem, digital twin solution, tightly coupled solution also toolkit allows people easily connect sensor data digital twin solution. so, seeing uptick directly releasing product capability interest owner space. expect see trend continue time, expect see u continue talk owner space, continue deliver solution owner space even apis owner space. area great interest, especially come vertical buildings, factory thing related well as, infrastructure like water owner solutions. so, yes, owner matter. building software them, going see that. bhavin shah -- analyst super helpful there. then, betsy, one you. term underlying improvement seeing margins, know called fx transaction model. know early, think next year, think like impact fx transaction model kind headline operating margins? betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer well, wish could give answer, think new cfo would probably little bit problem that. so, wait till end february give specific that. bhavin shah -- analyst fair enough. thanks taking may questions. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director good try. operator thank you. next question come line tyler radke citi. please go ahead, tyler. tyler radke -- analyst yeah, good afternoon. thanks taking questions. going ask placeholder next year's guidance, betsy. want waste question that, feel free answer. andrew, wanted kind ask comment made around efficiency, especially relates hiring janesh, pointed lot experience larger companies, vmware, cisco, et cetera. quarter transaction model rollout, kind visibility better channel prior channel relationships, direct billing customer. area identified efficiency potential? think efficiency unlock, think incremental free cash flow number next year? embedded already. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director so, many layer question. right. first, let kind answer question series stage dodge ones, ok? so, first off, optimization kind mindset autodesk. something suddenly happens. want reemphasize look right now, year, example, look apples-to-apples comparison, slide decks, disclosed material see non-gaap margin already hitting target set next year year, ok? so, optimization mentality. also heard say new transaction model start roll out, optimization go-to-market effort going critical step u part optimization journey on, that's going deliver margin growth company couple year come, ok? think that's important. long-term driver. getting specifics, ok? think specific probably another time, let kind give sense thing important, right? one drive self-service, right? self-service huge impact customer engage u customer come from, value accretive autodesk, efficiency side, renewal things, also revenue growth side capturing customer directly. thing talked understanding customer better, upsell cross-sell. so, going able lot automation understanding opportunity are, that's going drive efficiencies. moving channel partner away model transactional player solution provider ip provider customers. that's going sort opportunity eliminate duplication effort drive real cost efficiency company moving forward. there's top-line efficiency revenue growth, there's bottom line efficiency well removing redundancy step necessary customer. get lot clarity see u continue move forward go-to-market optimization next year beyond that. tyler radke -- analyst great. follow-up question, andrew, talked really strong net new customer addition within construction cloud, think, doubling year year. also saw make revenue accelerate 28% constant currency. help u understand, think reacceleration durable? sort thinking position there? what's driving strength new customer additions? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director first, let comment make revenues, going go construction. so, make revenue also includes revenue pix thing associated that. however, let's talk fact around construction business think important, right? no. 1 factor continue drive consistent, high growth construction solutions. seeing it. built make numbers, lion's share make numbers. really seeing consistent growth there. that's organically. inorganically, actually executing incredibly well thing like payapps, that's driving acceleration growth. so, decelerating business, ok?

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Simon Mays-Smith, VP, investor relations. Please go ahead. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Thanks, operator, and good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the third quarter results of Autodesk's fiscal '25. On the line with me is Andrew Anagnost, our CEO; and Betsy Rafael, our interim CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including outlook and related assumptions and on product and strategies. Actual events or results could differ materially. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-Q and the Form 8-K filed with today's press release for important risks and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today. If this call is replayed or reviewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Autodesk disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will quote several numeric or growth changes during this call as we discuss our financial performance. Unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison. All non-GAAP numbers referenced in today's call are reconciled in our press release or Excel financials and other supplemental materials available on our Investor Relations website. And now, I will turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Simon, and welcome, everyone, to the call. We finished the third quarter of the year strongly, delivering 12% revenue growth in constant currency and have again raised full year guidance. This reflects the sustained momentum of the business and successful execution of our strategy, including a smooth implementation of the new transaction model in Western Europe. Once again, opportunity, resilience and discipline underpinned our performance. Last month at Autodesk University in San Diego, we hosted 12,000 registered attendees and another 30,000 online. We showed how granular data in the cloud, organized the data models and connected to everything through APIs to deliver even more valuable and connected solutions for customers and partners and support a much broader ecosystem and marketplace. Customers and channel partners that I spoke with at AU remain cautiously optimistic, a sentiment consistent with the underlying momentum of our business, our growing product usage and BuildingConnected bid activity trends over recent quarters. I left AU with a tremendous sense of purpose and optimism in the ingenuity and persistence of our customers and for the future. On our earnings call last quarter, I set out our secular growth opportunities and our strategy to capitalize on them. I concluded that Autodesk's investment in cloud, platform and AI in pursuit of those opportunities were ahead of its peers. AU was a good demonstration of that. But we're also leading the industry in modernizing our go-to-market motion starting a few years ago with the subscription transition through consumption and self-service enablement and more recently to direct billing. These initiatives enable Autodesk to build larger and more durable direct relationships with its customers and to serve them more efficiently. We have already seen significant benefits from initiatives like these, and there's more to come in the next optimization phase. Taking out the effects on margins from FX and the new transaction model, we still expect to be toward the midpoint of our fiscal '26 non-GAAP operating margin target of 38% to 40% in fiscal '25, a year ahead of schedule. We're confident we will make further improvement in fiscal '26 on the same basis. The new transaction model will enable tighter channel partnerships with less duplication of effort and more digital self-service and automation, which increases customer satisfaction and workforce productivity. It will also create new opportunities for partners Autodesk to earn more with less emphasis on transaction revenue sharing and a greater emphasis on value creation for customers. Once complete, we expect the new transaction model and subsequent go-to-market optimization to increase sales and marketing efficiency and deliver GAAP margins among the best in the industry. Attractive, long-term, secular growth markets, a focused strategy delivering ever more valuable and connected solutions to our customers, and a resilient business are generating strong and sustained momentum, both in absolute terms and relative to peers. Disciplined execution and capital deployment has driven even greater operational velocity and efficiency within Autodesk and will underpin the mechanical build of revenue and free cash flow over the next few years and GAAP margins among the best in the industry. We will continue to deploy capital to offset and buy forward dilution as our free cash flow grows from the fiscal '24 trough. This practice has reduced our share count over the last three years. We have significantly increased our share repurchase authorization to extend this momentum flexibility over the medium term, with the precise trajectory remaining dependent on our debt repayment schedule and the ebb and flow of M&A. In combination, we believe these factors will deliver sustainable shareholder value over many years. Before I conclude, I'd like to formally welcome Janesh to Autodesk. We're excited to welcome Janesh, who brings a wealth of experience and will be instrumental in sustaining Autodesk's growth and enhanced profitability momentum. Of equal importance, I'd like to thank Betsy for stepping in as interim CFO at an important time in the company's journey, and I'm looking forward to continuing to work closely with her as an Autodesk Board member. I will now turn the call over to Betsy to discuss our quarterly financial performance and guidance for the year. I'll then return to provide an update on our strategic growth initiatives. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Andrew. Q3 was another strong quarter. We generated broad-based underlying growth across products and regions. In addition, we saw revenue increases from the new transaction model and M&A which were offset by the absence of enterprise business agreement true-ups from Q3 last year and FX. Our Make products continued to enhance growth, driven by our ongoing strength in construction and Fusion. Overall, macroeconomic policy and geopolitical challenges and the underlying momentum of the business were consistent with the last few quarters, with continued strong renewal rates and headwinds to our new business growth. Total revenue grew 11% and 12% in constant currency. By product, in constant currency, AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT revenue grew 8%. AEC revenue, which was most impacted by the absence of true-up revenues, grew 12%, Manufacturing revenue grew 16% and still comfortably in double digits, excluding upfront revenue. And M&E revenue grew 15% boosted by the PIX acquisition and associated integration adjustments. By region, in constant currency, revenue grew 11% in the Americas which was most impacted by the absence of true-up revenues, 13% in EMEA and 14% in APAC. The mechanical contribution from the new transaction model to revenue was $17 million in the third quarter and $25 million on a year-to-date basis. Direct revenue increased 23% and represented 42% of total revenue, up 4 percentage points from last year, benefiting from strong growth in both EBAs and the Autodesk store and also the natural tailwind to revenue from the new transaction model. Net revenue retention rate remained within the 100% to 110% range at constant exchange rates. Billings increased 28% in the quarter, reflecting a tailwind from the prior-year shift to annual billings for most multiyear contracts, early renewals and the natural tailwind from the transition to the new transaction model. Similar to last quarter, and as expected, co-terming negatively impacted billing ahead of the launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe. The natural contribution from the new transaction model to billing was $72 million in the third quarter and $108 million on a year-to-date basis. Total deferred revenue decreased 9% to $3.7 billion and was again impacted by the transition from upfront to annual billings for multiyear contracts. Total RPO of $6.1 billion and current RPO of $4.0 billion grew 17% and 14%, respectively, which reflects a tailwind from early renewals and the new transaction model and a headwind from the declining contribution of billed and unbilled deferred revenue from large, multiyear and EBA cohorts ahead of renewal in fiscal '26. Excluding these, current RPO growth was broadly consistent with Q2. We do expect the new transaction model and the larger FY '26 renewal cohorts to have a greater impact on both RPO and current RPO growth in Q4 of fiscal '25. Turning to margins. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were broadly low. With Autodesk University shifting back to Q3 this year from Q4 last year, GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins decreased by 2 and 3 percentage points, respectively. The timing effect from AU obviously washes out over the full year. At current course and speed, the ratio of stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue peaked in fiscal '24, will follow by more than a percentage point in fiscal '25 and will be below 10% over time. Free cash flow for the quarter was $199 million. This benefited from some channel partners in Western Europe booking business earlier in the quarter ahead of the transition to the new transaction model really to derisk month one after the transition. This accelerated free cash flow to the third quarter, which was partially offset by the expected negative impact of co-terming in Western Europe. Turning now to capital allocation. We continue to actively manage capital within our framework and deploy it with discipline and focus through the economic cycle to drive long-term shareholder value. As expected, the pace of buybacks picked up in the third quarter. We purchased approximately 1.2 million shares for $319 million at an average price of approximately $269 per share. We will continue to deploy capital to offset and buy forward dilution as our free cash flow grows from the fiscal '24 trough. This practice has reduced our share count by about 5 million shares over the last three years with an average percentage reduction of about 70 basis points per year. We increased the amount authorized under our share repurchase program by $5 billion for a total of approximately $9 billion. This expands our flexibility over the medium term with the precise trajectory remaining dependent on our debt repayment schedule as well as, the ebbs and flow of M&A. Now let me finish with guidance. As we said in the February, the pace of the rollout of the new transaction model will create noise in billings and the P&L. So, we think free cash flow is the best measure of our performance. Taking out that noise, the underlying momentum in the business remains consistent with the expectations embedded in our guidance range for the full year with continued strong renewal rates and headwinds to new business growth. Our sustained momentum in the third quarter and smooth launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe, reduced the likelihood of our more cautious forecast scenario. Given that, we're raising the midpoint of our billing, revenue, margin, earnings per share and free cash flow guidance ranges. So, let me give you a little bit more detail. The underlying momentum of billing is in line with our expectations. Compared to our modeling at the start of the year, the launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe in Q3 and early renewals have been a tailwind for billings, whereas more co-terming, more business done under the old buy-sell model before the launch of the new transaction model and in recent weeks, FX movement have been headwinds for billing. We now estimate that the new transaction model will provide between a 5 and 5.5 percentage point tailwind to billings growth in fiscal '25. We've raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 billings guidance by $10 million to a range of $5.90 billion to $5.98 billion. The underlying momentum of revenue is also in line with our expectations. We estimate the new transaction model will provide around 1 to 1.5 percentage point tailwind to revenue growth in fiscal '25. Upfront revenue contributed 2 percentage points to revenue growth in Q4 of fiscal '24, and therefore, this is a headwind in Q4 of fiscal '25. While not large enough to call out at the start of the year, it was already factored into our Q4 and our full year model. We've raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 revenue guidance range by $18 million to a range of $6.12 billion to $6.13 billion. We're increasing our GAAP and non-GAAP margin guidance midpoint by 25 basis points by raising the bottom end of the ranges by 50 basis points. The GAAP margin guidance range is now 21.5% to 22%. The non-GAAP margin guidance range is now 35.5% to 36%, which includes a 1 to 1.5 percentage point underlying margin improvement, broadly offset by the margin headwinds from the new transaction model and the related incremental investments in people, processes and automation. The underlying momentum of free cash flow is also in line with our expectations. The headwind to billings from co-terming and FX rates that I mentioned earlier, is being offset by early renewals, faster collections and improved underlying margins. We raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 free cash flow guidance by $10 million and tightened the range to $1.47 billion to $1.5 billion. We expect strong free cash flow growth in fiscal '26 because of the return of our largest multiyear renewal cohort the natural mechanical stacking of multiyear contracts billed annually and a larger EBA cohort. With our current trajectory, we still estimate free cash flow in fiscal '26 to be around $2.05 billion at the midpoint. The slide deck on our website has more details on modeling assumptions for Q3 and for the full fiscal year '25. And while this may be my last earnings call for Autodesk, I will stick around for a bit to ensure a smooth transition to Janesh. Thank you, Andrew, and everyone at Autodesk for your support while I was here and to the many investors and the analysts with whom I've had lively discussions over the last few quarters. While the transition to annual billings for multiyear contracts and the deployment of the new transaction model has created noise and billings in the P&L, they do provide a natural near-term tailwind to revenue and free cash flow growth. Combined with a resilient business model, sustained competitive momentum, Autodesk has enviable sources of visibility and certainty to very uncertain world. For all these reasons, I stepped down from my role as interim CFO with tremendous optimism for the future. Andrew, back to you. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Betsy. Let me finish by updating you on our strong progress in the third quarter. We continue to see good momentum in AEC, particularly in infrastructure and construction, fueled by customers consolidating onto our solutions to connect and optimize previously siloed workflows through the cloud. The cornerstone of that growing interest is our comprehensive end-to-end solutions in completing designs, preconstruction, field execution through handover and into operations. This breadth of connected capability enables us to extend our footprint further into infrastructure and construction and also expand our reach into the mid-market. As a sign of our growing momentum as the benefits of our end-to-end solution become more apparent, our construction business continue to perform robustly with net new customers doubling year over year and existing customers' renewal and expansion rates remaining strong. Let me give you a few examples. Power Construction is No. 79 on the Engineering News Record, ENR Top 400 U.S. contractor list. It is a Chicago-based general contractor serving residential and nonresidential end markets. After completing a competitive RFP to replace its legacy project management tool, Power selected Autodesk for its unified construction platform across preconstruction, construction, and DDC. By standardizing on Autodesk Construction Cloud, Power will have a single source of truth for project data, enhanced collaboration capabilities, and streamlined workflows on a single platform. Power Construction was one of two ENR 400 top 100 U.S. contractors that standardized enterprisewide on Autodesk build during the quarter. In Europe, Bouygues, a top 10 ENR 250 international contractor based in France and a leader in sustainable building and infrastructure projects renewed and expanded its EBA in the quarter. Bouygues is continuing to consolidate on Autodesk solutions across the enterprise, including broader adoption of Autodesk Forma, Carbon Insight, and Informed Design to digitize, decarbonize, and industrialize projects. It also significantly increased its commitment to Autodesk Construction Cloud to drive efficiency gains and faster bid response times through better collaboration between design and project teams. Surbana Jurong is No. 23 on ENR's top 225 international design firms. Based in Singapore, it is an urban infrastructure and integrated solutions consulting firm. In Q3, it renewed its third EBA, which included increased investment in Autodesk Construction Cloud and Autodesk Water infrastructure solutions. ACC is helping to scale its operations through increased automation, integrated design workflows and enhanced collaboration across time zones. Our water infrastructure solutions will be a core technology supporting its growth ambitions in planning, designing, engineering and managing water projects for customers worldwide. Again, these stories have a common theme. Managing people, processes and data across the project life cycle to increase efficiency and sustainability while decreasing risk. Over time, we expect the majority of all projects to be managed this way, and we remain focused on enabling that transition through our industry cloud. Moving on to manufacturing. We made excellent progress on our strategic initiatives. Customers continue to invest in their digital transformation and consolidate our Design and Make platform. Fusion remains one of the fastest-growing products in the manufacturing industry. As customers seek to drive innovation and growth at lower cost, Fusion extension attach rates are increasing, which is helping to drive the average sales price higher. For example, in the quarter, a global manufacturer supplying the semiconductor industry selected Fusion Manage and Vault PLM over competitive solutions to foster greater collaboration across manufacturing sites and improve operating efficiency. Once fully scaled and operational, this customer expects to save 105,000 hours per year by connecting people and data, resulting in reduced product development costs and faster time to market. In the U.K., Playdale Playground has been designing, manufacturing, and installing outdoor playground equipment for over 40 years. This quarter, Playdale added Fusion to its existing portfolio of Autodesk solutions, including Inventor, AutoCAD, and Vault to streamline and digitize workflows, optimize production to reduce lead times, reduce nonconformities, and replace inefficient Excel-driven operations on the shop floor. A long time Autodesk customer and global leader in precision engineering solutions renewed and expanded its EBA in the quarter. In addition to Inventor, vault and AutoCAD, it is adopting Fusion's generative design capabilities for material waste reduction and fluid flow optimization and Moldflow to reduce manufacturing costs and defects while increasing mold yields. In education, universities continue to modernize their courses and curriculum to attract and prepare future engineers. For example, from this winter, students at the University of Stuttgart, Institute for Medical Device Technology will use Fusion across six courses. Fusion was selected to replace a competitive solution for its modern platform, ease of use, cloud collaboration capabilities and unique combination of PCB and additive manufacturing workflows in a single team environment. And lastly, we continue to work with our customers to ensure they are using the latest and most secure versions of our software. For example, after a period of rapid scaling and diversification, a large multinational manufacturing company in APAC was looking to align compliance rates across its global employee base. Working collaboratively we address compliance issues while cementing a long-term partnership and completing one of our largest ever license compliance agreements, which included expanded adoption of Alias and VRED for the Design Studio and PDMC for mechanical engineering and rail design. Attractive long-term secular growth markets, a focused strategy delivering ever more valuable and connected solutions to our customers and a resilient business are generating strong and sustained momentum both in absolute terms and relative to peers. Disciplined execution and capital deployment is driving an even greater operational velocity and efficiency within Autodesk, and we continue to deploy capital to deliver sustainable shareholder value over many years. I retain a tremendous sense of purpose and optimism in the ingenuity and persistence of our customers and for the future. Operator, we would now like to open the call up for questions. Questions & Answers: Operator Thank you. [Operator instructions] Again, please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Jason Celino of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your question, please. Jason Celino -- Analyst Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Just two for me. The first one, Andrew. Some of us are unfamiliar with Janesh. Can you just tell us a little bit more about him and what he brings to Autodesk? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director I certainly can. Before I do that, let me make sure that I thank Betsy for everything she brought to Autodesk during this interim period. I really appreciate it. The company appreciates it. Thank you, Betsy. Now we're really excited about Janesh. Let me tell you why we're excited about Janesh. As you remember, one of the things I was telling you that I was looking for was someone that was going to be able to dispassionately drive optimization at scale inside of Autodesk. And what that really means is someone that's going to be really inwardly focused, looking at every dollar that we invest and making sure that we're getting the most return for the business that investors are getting the best return from their business. The next kind of criteria we were looking for, which was nice to have was, time in the seat as a sitting CFO, which was important for us as well. But it was kind of the next nice to have after the optimization at scale. Janesh brings a great balance of both of those things, right? He's been in the seat seven years at Elastic, both CFO and COO, driving some fairly turbulent changes inside of Elastic. So, he's got battle stars from pushing inside the company to get changes done inside, and we like that. We like that a lot. He's also got very good early experience at companies that we feel have always added value to Autodesk. So, he was it VMware in a senior position. He was at Cisco in a senior position. We've had good success bringing people from those kind of companies. He worked at those companies driving optimization at scale, which is the No. 1 criteria I was looking for when we we're driving this work. He also has another nice to have. He's got knowledge of our industry. He spent two years at PTC in his career. He was actually recently on the PTC board. So, he understands our industry, and he'll be able to get up to speed pretty quickly. The No. 1 goal here drive optimization and scale over the next few years, make sure that we're getting everything we need from every dollar we invest, which is a very important theme for Autodesk. And with that, I'm really excited, and I'm looking forward to him joining in December. Jason Celino -- Analyst OK. Great. Interesting. And then for my second question, now that you do have a CFO, do you have any thoughts on when you might hold the next Investor Day? I think in the past, you usually did it in March. Is that a good time frame? Or is that too soon? Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. Well, Janesh is joining in December. I think we need to give him time to get his sea legs on giving time to kind of drive the end of the year and actually get us set up for next fiscal year in good stead. So, I would say it's unlikely we'll be doing anything in the spring, but we'll get back to you on that as soon as Janesh is ready to talk about those things. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Your question, please. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst Thank you. Andrew, as of the third quarter, your three-year CAGR for current RPO is about 12%. How are you thinking about the sustainability or perhaps improvement upon that CAGR or CRPO over the next number of years? When we think about the ingredients of that, it looks like over the last several years, the CAGR for your unit volume for all brands is roughly 6% to 7% in the aggregate. So, on top of that, you've had price and other ingredients, but perhaps talk about how you think you might be able to improve upon the most recent trajectory for current RPO. Then my follow-up. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Hi, Jay, this is Betsy. Let me just give you a couple of things. There's a number of things that are going on, on the headline of the CRPO number. If you first take away the headwinds and the tailwinds was broadly consistent with the second quarter. And as I mentioned in my opening commentary, early renewals and growth with -- and the new transaction model are providing a tailwind. And then there's also a headwind to CRPO growth from the declining contribution of billed and unbilled deferred revenue risk from the large multiyear EBA cohorts coming up for renewal in fiscal '26. And just as a reminder, these are the same larger cohorts we are calling out as the tailwinds to free cash flow for next year. And if you look back to fiscal '22, we saw the same dynamic ahead of the fiscal '23 renewals as well. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst OK. Since new management is part of the news this evening, could you talk about how you're thinking about the chief revenue officer position. Would it make sense perhaps to continue to have a separate CRO? Or do you think it might make more sense perhaps to combine CRO and COO? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, we're going to continue to have a separate CRO because we have various functions that work together there under the COO organization, including our IT organization, our infrastructure and all things associated. What we're looking for in our CRO is someone that understands how to continue to drive a business when you have direct engagement with the customer. So, that means someone that really understands what it takes to analyze self-service patterns, actually understand the data that comes in from the customers to help drive cross-sell and upsell while also transforming a channel from a transactionally focused extension of Autodesk to kind of a solution partner that's driving life cycle solutions for our customers. So, that's the kind of role we're looking for here. And yes, it's going to continue to be a stand-alone CRO role within the COO organization. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Borg of Stifel. Your line is open. Adam Borg -- Analyst Awesome. Thanks so much for taking the questions, and congrats to Betsy and Janesh. Maybe on the new transaction model. I know it's still early. But I was just curious, are there any learnings from those customers that are on the new model that you're seeing in terms of the adoption of Autodesk technology and the ability to find white space to better upsell and cross-sell different solutions now that you have a more direct relationship. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah, Adam, it's really early on to be able to make any kind of conclusions about that. What I can tell you is that we definitely see some shifts to some of the direct channels at Autodesk for customers that were probably just served on a very kind of arm's length kind of transactional level. But in terms of driving cross-sell and upsell, early days, early days. But if you want to get a sense for how that might evolve, we've got experience with our EBAs and our enterprise business agreements. And we've learned over the years that having that kind of relationship with the customer where we really understand their usage patterns, who they are and what they're doing, we are much more effective at driving cross-sell and upsell even when partnering with our channel partners. So, I think those kind of stand as a testament of what's possible as we move forward with completion of the new transaction model. Adam Borg -- Analyst Great. And maybe just as a quick follow-up. Just as we think about the new administration coming in, you talked about the macro being broadly consistent. Any change in tone in your conversations with the end markets in terms of optimism or their ability or willingness to expand new projects ahead of the administration? Any pause or just full steam ahead? I'm just curious, any commentary you have there from a macro perspective would be really, really helpful. Thanks so much. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director What I'll say is the things that matter to our customers are bipartisan things, all right? Our customers care about infrastructure builds out. Both parties care about infrastructure build-outs. Our customers care about domestic manufacturing in Europe, be it in the United States, both parties agree that the domestic manufacturing build-outs are important. Supply chain, independent, supply chain stability. All of these things are bipartisan issues that really affect our customers. So, regardless of the administration, I suspect the things that are important to our customers are continuing to be a focus. Adam Borg -- Analyst Thanks, again. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink of Baird. Please go ahead, Joe. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst Thank you. On the outlook for next year, $2.050 billion in free cash has, I think, been the expectation for the past year now. Within the last year, you've also seen more co-term of contracts. And I think that leads to better billings in FY '26. So, my question is, does that actually create the potential that things are better, and that's why you're qualifying now the $2.050 billion as the midpoint of possibilities. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer There's no change to how we've talked about the free cash flow guide for fiscal '26, it continues to be $2.05 billion at the mid-point. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst OK. Fair enough. And then just on the M&A environment, over recent history, Autodesk has been more in a mode of, I would say, strategic tuck-ins. I think there is actually an asset in the CFD simulation space that was announced during AU in the quarter. Is that the right approach for Autodesk, just given this point in time, all the work you've done to build out the cloud platform, the data models, and so these tuck-ins make the most sense? And if that's true, how would you maybe compare and contrast some of the larger-scale M&A that's happening with your peers in the space? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, look, consolidation in our space is inevitable. I'm not going to comment on any specific deals, but here's what I'll say. Autodesk has always been an acquisitive company, and we will be an inquisitive company when that makes both strategic and financial sense for the company. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst OK. Thank you. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Joe. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Porter of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Elizabeth. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great, thanks so much for the question. As partners are getting customers just up and running on the new transaction model, we picked up that they're spending a little bit more time than usual of time and resources with those existing customers. So, I was curious if that had any impact on new business demand kind of more recently -- and then just more broadly, any change in new business trends that you think you should call out from versus last quarter? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Elizabeth, it's Betsy. And so, just broadly speaking, we continue to see growth, but at a slower pace due to a number of factors really over the last several years, macro, COVID, exiting Russia, elections, and while a drag on the forward momentum of the business, all of that really factored into our guidance. So, I kind of just will leave it at that. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great. And then a follow-up just on billings. I understand there's a lot of volatility around the change from multiyear in the transaction model. But it looks like guidance implies a bigger step down in growth in Q4, just despite easier year-ago compare. So, hoping that you could help us unpack the balance of those headwinds and tailwinds that would drive kind of a greater downtick in growth in Q4. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, again, let me start out with just from a fiscal '25 perspective. Your billing tailwinds are going to be from the final shift to annual billings, new transaction model and early renewals. And you're going to get headwinds from co-terming and business booked ahead of the new transaction model launch and in recent weeks, some FX. So, again, I think that we've continued to perform well as we've executed through through Q3. And so, I think we feel very, very strongly about our expectations for Q4. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bhavin Shah of Deutsche Bank. Your question please, Bhavin. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Great, thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the quarter. Andrew, at university, there appeared to be a noticeable uptick in attendance and sessions geared toward owners and operators. What been driving the recent interest from the segment? How much of it is product enhancements you guys have made versus really more focusing and emphasizing from a go-to-market perspective? And how long before this segment of buyers kind of becomes more meaningful to the financials? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah, Bhavin, that's an excellent question, right. We're very interested in tackling the whole entire life cycle from design, through make, construction, manufacturing, all the way into operations. You're probably aware we have a product called Tandem. And a lot of those sessions were driven by increasing interest and increasing adoption of Tandem, which is a digital twin solution, tightly coupled to our solutions that also has a toolkit that allows people to easily connect sensor data through the digital twin solution. So, you're seeing that uptick because we're directly releasing products and capabilities that are of interest to the owner space. You can expect to see that trend continue over time, and you can expect to see us continue to talk about the owner space, continue to deliver solutions for the owner space and even APIs for the owner space. It's an area of great interest, especially when it comes not only to vertical buildings, but factories and other things that are related to that as well as, infrastructure like what we were doing with some of our water owner solutions. So, yes, owners matter. We're building software for them, and you're going to see more of that. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Super helpful there. And then, Betsy, one for you. Just in terms of the underlying improvement that we've been seeing in the margins, and I know you've called out FX and the transaction model. I know it's very early, but as you think about next year, how do we think about like the impact of FX and the transaction model to kind of the headline operating margins? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, I wish I could give you that answer, but I think that the new CFO would probably have a little bit of a problem with that. So, we'll wait till the end of February to give you more specifics on that. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Fair enough. Thanks for taking may questions. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Good try. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke of Citi. Please go ahead, Tyler. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Yeah, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I was going to ask you about a placeholder for next year's guidance, Betsy. don't want to waste a question on that, but feel free to answer. But Andrew, I wanted to kind of ask you about some of your comments you made around efficiency, especially as it relates to hiring Janesh, who you pointed out has a lot of experience at larger companies, VMware, Cisco, et cetera. Now that you're a few quarters into this transaction model rollout, you have kind of visibility better on some of the channel prior channel relationships, having that direct billing with the customer. What are some of the areas that you've identified as having that efficiency potential? And then as we think about that efficiency unlock, should we think about that as incremental to the free cash flow number you have out for next year? Or is that embedded in that already. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director So, many layers to that question. All right. First, let me kind of answer the question in a series of stages then dodge other ones, OK? So, first off, optimization is kind of a mindset at Autodesk. It's not something that that suddenly happens. I want to reemphasize that because if you look right now, this year, for example, when you look at the apples-to-apples comparison, which will be in the slide decks, are in our disclosed materials you can see that our non-GAAP margins are already hitting the targets we set for next year this year, OK? So, optimization is a mentality. You've also heard me say over and over again as the new transaction model starts to roll out, optimization of our go-to-market efforts is going to be a critical step for us and part of the optimization journey that we're on, that's going to deliver margin growth for the company for couple of years to come, OK? And I think that's important. It's a long-term driver. Now with getting into the specifics, OK? I think the specifics are probably for another time, but let me just kind of give you a sense for some of the things that are important, right? One is the drive to self-service, right? Self-service is a huge impact on how our customers will engage with us and where those customers come from, and that is value accretive to Autodesk, both on an efficiency side, from renewals and other things, but also on the revenue growth side through capturing the customers directly. The other thing I talked about is understanding the customer better, so the upsell and cross-sell. So, we're going to be able to do a lot more automation and understanding about where the opportunities are, and that's going to drive some efficiencies. And we're moving the channel partners away from this model of being the transactional players to being the solution providers and the IP providers to our customers. That's going to have all sorts of opportunities to eliminate duplication of effort and drive real cost efficiencies for the company moving forward. There's both top-line efficiencies here in revenue growth, but there's bottom line efficiencies as well through removing the redundancies and steps that just aren't necessary for the customer. You'll get a lot more clarity on that as you see us continue to move forward with this go-to-market optimization in the next year and beyond that. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Great. And then my follow-up question, Andrew, you talked about some really strong net new customer additions within the Construction Cloud, I think, doubling year over year. we also saw the Make revenue accelerate to 28% constant currency. Can you just help us understand, do you think that reacceleration is durable? And how are you sort of thinking about just your position there? What's been driving that strength in the new customer additions? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director First, let me comment on the make revenues, then I'm going to go into construction. So, the make revenue also includes some revenue from PIX and things associated with that. However, let's talk about the facts around our construction business because I think this is important, right? No. 1 factor is that we continue to drive consistent, high growth in our construction solutions. You're seeing it. It's built into the Make numbers, and it's the lion's share of those Make numbers. You're really seeing some consistent growth there. That's organically. Inorganically, we're actually executing incredibly well on things like Payapps, and that's driving acceleration of our growth. So, we are not decelerating as a business, OK? We are actually performing solidly inorganically, we're accelerating, all right? And I just want to be really clear about that. And yes, we said year over year, we drove a 2x increase in our new customers. And I'll talk about where some of that's coming from in just a minute. But I also want to highlight the other thing that's going on we are strengthening an already strong position in the ENR 400. So, you heard about the story about power construction, which was a great example of someone taking out a competitive RFP and say, look, I need a forward-looking cloud-based solution on new technology that goes end to end from design to construction all the way to operations. And they chose us. And that was just one example that we gave in the opening commentary. So, already a strengthening position in the ENR 400. Now the other qualitative things that are driving some of that new customer growth is we already have our distribution channel operating at scale. In the U.S., this is helping us go down market more effectively, which is allowing us to capture more customers more effectively be places where we weren't before and where others aren't, which is part of driving that. But also, we're already at scale operating internationally with our distribution channel. So, that's driving international growth for us. And that's a really important driver as well as, some of those net new accounts that you're seeing there. And the last thing I'll add that I'm done with construction is that, look, I heard this over and over again at AU, I'm hearing it over and over again from customers in lots of different places. They want the end-to-end solution. They want the licensed version in the cloud, they're placing bets for the next 10 years. They want to go from design to construction to operations, and that's just making our solution more attractive to the market. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo. Your question, please. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Hey, thanks very much. I appreciate you taking the questions. A commentary on the call sounded consistent, but wondering if there are any added details you can provide for us on just the overall macro spend environment and how that's maybe progressing across either key product segments or geos, whatever split you think is more useful. I think what we're trying to get a sense for is if there are any shades of improvement anywhere or if you'd characterize as mainly just consistent over the past couple of quarters. Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Michael, I think the core answer here is consistency, OK? We're seeing consistent trends that we've seen with -- in all the other quarters. There's always puts and takes in a large business like ours, especially ones as divers as ours. But the general tone is consistent with prior quarters. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer And I would just add that there's also been a lot of noise this year from the new transaction model and then obviously, the elections and leading up to that. And so, it's hard to sparse out kind of that particular behavior. So, I think as Andrew said, we call it consistent. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Yeah, tough for us, too. That's why we keep asking. Betsy, congrats on the transition back given you're also on the board. I think it'd be useful to hear you chime in on the hiring of Janesh and maybe just also comment on how you ensure you're able to hand over the reins and keep progress going on the key transitions the company is working through. Thanks. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Per se, I was involved in the process, which was quite extensive in the company and the recruiting of Janesh. And so, we're certainly very excited to have him on board. What I would also say is, obviously, with my experience of being on the board for 11 years as well as, my deep dive into the business over the last six months. One of the reasons I'm staying around until the end of the fiscal year, is I think I could be really helpful in that transition for Janesh. And so, I'm very much looking forward to it. And I think that we have a great finance team, and I think that he's going to fit very well, and I'm looking forward to making that happen as fast as we can. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. Your question, please, Matthew. Mike Richards -- Analyst Hey, guys. This is Mike Richards on for Matt. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could provide an update on Project Bernini and maybe how customer reception has been and where we are in developing other foundational models or just the monetization opportunity there? Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, first off, before I comment on Bernini, as you might have heard from AU, AI is embedded in everything we're doing from a bottom-up and a top-down perspective. And you also heard us talk at AU about new types of foundation models we're building that understand how certain things are done in our applications. You heard about a foundation model that's driving automated drawing creation. You heard about a foundation model that's driving automated sketch generation and sketch constraints. That kind of stuff is bottom-up innovation. Bernini more of a top-down type innovation where you're actually specifying things and trying to generate a preliminary outcome from those specifications. And what we've been doing with Bernini is we've been trying to engage with certain targeted customers to get them to participate with us in making Bernini smarter and more intelligent. It's not available commercially right now. but it's getting more intelligent. We've actually been successful in getting some customers to stand up and say, look, yes, I'd like to work with you to make this more intelligent because we need something that actually understands 3D geometry as geometry, not just in the picture or something, OK? So, that's what's going on with Bernini right now, and you should continue to see refinements and extensions of that moving forward. Now with regard to monetization, monetization, nobody knows exactly how all this is going to be monetized. But there's a few vectors here that that come into play. One, we are ahead of our competitors in this space. We intend to be ahead. We're investing to stay ahead. That increase ones competitive position in the marketplace, and that's really important. Also, you get to be able to charge for some of these incremental features in the future. When you're delivering value or a high-quality outcome as a result, you're going to charge for that outcome. How we charge for those things? Let's just play out, OK? It's still early days. But there's also monetization opportunities through licensing certain technologies for specific mature maturation for specific customers' needs, all right? And that will be another avenue. So, how these avenues play out, which one waits more, let this play out. But what you need to know about Autodesk is we're ahead. We've been ahead for a while. We were the first out there with an AI research lab that been out there for over six years. It's published 70 papers. We're right on the cutting edge of 3D design technology in AI, and we intend to stay there. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of J.P. Morgan. Your question please, Steve. Stephen Tusa -- Analyst Good evening or afternoon. Lots of good questions asked. Just a detailed one. What's the change in the billings contribution from the transaction model change? The five to six to five to five and a half. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Yeah. So, it's basically because we did more buy/sell business ahead of the European launch. It's short answer. So, remember, we said 5% to 6% when we launched Europe. And it was the -- we did more buy sell business, which means there's less tailwind from the new transaction model. The flip side of -- that means that the underlying increase in our billings guidance is greater than it looks on a headline basis. Stephen Tusa -- Analyst OK, great. Thanks a lot. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Tilton of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Hey, guys, can you hear me? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Great. I have a kind of a high-level one on the incoming CFO. If I heard correctly, we didn't exactly get like an initial outlook for revenue growth for next year. And I'm just trying to understand in the context of the new CFO coming in, is there anything that could change the calculus of how you guys think about that 10% to 15% growth for the underlying business outside of the agency transition that's ongoing today. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Well, first, let's talk about that framework a little bit, and then I'll comment a little bit on the incoming CFO. So, look, the 10% to 15% growth. Right now, we're pretty much right at the bottom end of that range. And if we look back over the last two years, there's been a series of things that created headwinds to new business. It started off with things like the pandemic, the inflation, the exiting of the Russian business, the writer's strike, the whole trade wars within particular geographies. All of these things were accumulated headwinds that build slowly into the business and have pushed us down to the low end of the range. it takes time in a subscription model for those things to build out of the business, OK? So, it's going to take time for us to build out of that. That's to be expected with a subscription model. The revenue goes down slowly. It goes back up slowly as headwinds turn into tailwinds. So, expect us to be near the bottom of that range in the short term just as a general kind of guideline for the core business to be at the bottom of the range, OK? As a long-term framework, the 10% to 15% still makes sense as a long-term guide for the company. But of course, as new eyes come in, we'll look at these things, and we'll evaluate them. But right now, this all still makes sense. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Super helpful. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho. Your question, please. Siti Panigrahi -- Analyst Thanks for taking my question. I understand the new business model of some kind of noise in your expense and margin side. But if you exclude that, where do you see some of the operating leverage that you can drive in next year or so? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, I think we've actually provided kind of historically what we've done over the last three years pretty clearly. And I think we said that we continue to be focused on expansion, but nothing further to add as far as next year. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director We did provide data on that. So, you can see what underlying thing is, and we expect to see continued improvement in that same vector. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations On the same basis. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director On the same basis, on the same apples-to-apples basis. Siti Panigrahi -- Analyst OK, great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Funk of Bank of America. Your question, please. Michael Funk -- Analyst Yeah. Guys, thank you for the question tonight. Two, if I could. You've mentioned a few times in the last calls about the largest multiyear cohort renewing next year and then also a large EBA cohort. Just wondering if you can give us kind of the range of potential outcomes among the renewals there, whether a potential to upsell, risk of down sell and what that variance might look like around those renewals? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer No. I mean I think what we have said is that it's the largest cohort and we saw that performance in '23. And so, we expect a strong renewal year, but we're not giving any specific guidance on what that looks like for '26 at this point, and we'll wait until we report earnings in February. Michael Funk -- Analyst OK. Great. And then, Betsy, one more. You've mentioned a few times after the investment in new transaction model, people processes, and automation, presumably more fixed cost versus variable like commission. Can you quantify that for us to help us with modeling as we try to forecast margin? I know you've not given guidance, but better understanding of what that cost might actually be on an absolute basis would help us to think about our modeling. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Mike, we've got a slide in the earnings deck to help you think about modeling. And I'll just point you to that. Michael Funk -- Analyst OK, great. Thank you, Simon. Operator Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for Q&A today. I would now like to turn the conference back to Simon Mays-Smith for closing remarks. Sir? Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Great. Thanks, Latif, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Looking forward to seeing many of you on the road over the next few weeks. If you have any questions in the meantime, please email me or call me. And in the meantime, for those of you in North America wishing you a very happy Thanksgiving. Thank you, Latif.

[operator instructions] again, please stand compile q&a roster. first question come line jason celino keybanc capital markets. question, please. jason celino -- analyst hey, thanks taking questions. two me. first one, andrew. u unfamiliar janesh. tell u little bit brings autodesk? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director certainly can. that, let make sure thank betsy everything brought autodesk interim period. really appreciate it. company appreciates it. thank you, betsy. really excited janesh. let tell excited janesh. remember, one thing telling looking someone going able dispassionately drive optimization scale inside autodesk. really mean someone that's going really inwardly focused, looking every dollar invest making sure getting return business investor getting best return business. next kind criterion looking for, nice was, time seat sitting cfo, important u well. kind next nice optimization scale. janesh brings great balance things, right? seat seven year elastic, cfo coo, driving fairly turbulent change inside elastic. so, got battle star pushing inside company get change done inside, like that. like lot. also got good early experience company feel always added value autodesk. so, vmware senior position. cisco senior position. good success bringing people kind companies. worked company driving optimization scale, no. 1 criterion looking driving work. also another nice have. got knowledge industry. spent two year ptc career. actually recently ptc board. so, understands industry, able get speed pretty quickly. no. 1 goal drive optimization scale next years, make sure getting everything need every dollar invest, important theme autodesk. that, really excited, looking forward joining december. jason celino -- analyst ok. great. interesting. second question, cfo, thought might hold next investor day? think past, usually march. good time frame? soon? thanks. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah. well, janesh joining december. think need give time get sea leg giving time kind drive end year actually get u set next fiscal year good stead. so, would say unlikely anything spring, get back soon janesh ready talk things. operator thank you. next question come line jay vleeschhouwer griffin securities. question, please. jay vleeschhouwer -- analyst thank you. andrew, third quarter, three-year cagr current rpo 12%. thinking sustainability perhaps improvement upon cagr crpo next number years? think ingredient that, look like last several years, cagr unit volume brand roughly 6% 7% aggregate. so, top that, price ingredients, perhaps talk think might able improve upon recent trajectory current rpo. follow-up. betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer yeah. hi, jay, betsy. let give couple things. there's number thing going on, headline crpo number. first take away headwind tailwind broadly consistent second quarter. mentioned opening commentary, early renewal growth -- new transaction model providing tailwind. there's also headwind crpo growth declining contribution billed unbilled deferred revenue risk large multiyear eba cohort coming renewal fiscal '26. reminder, larger cohort calling tailwind free cash flow next year. look back fiscal '22, saw dynamic ahead fiscal '23 renewal well. jay vleeschhouwer -- analyst ok. since new management part news evening, could talk thinking chief revenue officer position. would make sense perhaps continue separate cro? think might make sense perhaps combine cro coo? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah. so, going continue separate cro various function work together coo organization, including organization, infrastructure thing associated. looking cro someone understands continue drive business direct engagement customer. so, mean someone really understands take analyze self-service patterns, actually understand data come customer help drive cross-sell upsell also transforming channel transactionally focused extension autodesk kind solution partner that's driving life cycle solution customers. so, that's kind role looking here. yes, going continue stand-alone cro role within coo organization. jay vleeschhouwer -- analyst thank much. operator thank you. next question come line adam borg stifel. line open. adam borg -- analyst awesome. thanks much taking questions, congrats betsy janesh. maybe new transaction model. know still early. curious, learning customer new model seeing term adoption autodesk technology ability find white space better upsell cross-sell different solution direct relationship. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah, adam, really early able make kind conclusion that. tell definitely see shift direct channel autodesk customer probably served kind arm's length kind transactional level. term driving cross-sell upsell, early days, early days. want get sense might evolve, got experience ebas enterprise business agreements. learned year kind relationship customer really understand usage patterns, doing, much effective driving cross-sell upsell even partnering channel partners. so, think kind stand testament what's possible move forward completion new transaction model. adam borg -- analyst great. maybe quick follow-up. think new administration coming in, talked macro broadly consistent. change tone conversation end market term optimism ability willingness expand new project ahead administration? pause full steam ahead? curious, commentary macro perspective would really, really helpful. thanks much. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director say thing matter customer bipartisan things, right? customer care infrastructure build out. party care infrastructure build-outs. customer care domestic manufacturing europe, united states, party agree domestic manufacturing build-outs important. supply chain, independent, supply chain stability. thing bipartisan issue really affect customers. so, regardless administration, suspect thing important customer continuing focus. adam borg -- analyst thanks, again. operator thank you. next question come line joe vruwink baird. please go ahead, joe. joe vruwink -- analyst thank you. outlook next year, $2.050 billion free cash has, think, expectation past year now. within last year, also seen co-term contracts. think lead better billing fy '26. so, question is, actually create potential thing better, that's qualifying $2.050 billion midpoint possibilities. betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer there's change talked free cash flow guide fiscal '26, continues $2.05 billion mid-point. joe vruwink -- analyst ok. fair enough. m&a environment, recent history, autodesk mode of, would say, strategic tuck-ins. think actually asset cfd simulation space announced au quarter. right approach autodesk, given point time, work done build cloud platform, data models, tuck-ins make sense? that's true, would maybe compare contrast larger-scale m&a that's happening peer space? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah. so, look, consolidation space inevitable. going comment specific deals, here's say. autodesk always acquisitive company, inquisitive company make strategic financial sense company. joe vruwink -- analyst ok. thank you. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director thank you, joe. operator thank you. next question come line elizabeth porter morgan stanley. please go ahead, elizabeth. elizabeth porter -- analyst great, thanks much question. partner getting customer running new transaction model, picked spending little bit time usual time resource existing customers. so, curious impact new business demand kind recently -- broadly, change new business trend think call versus last quarter? betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer yeah. elizabeth, betsy. so, broadly speaking, continue see growth, slower pace due number factor really last several years, macro, covid, exiting russia, elections, drag forward momentum business, really factored guidance. so, kind leave that. elizabeth porter -- analyst great. follow-up billings. understand there's lot volatility around change multiyear transaction model. look like guidance implies bigger step growth q4, despite easier year-ago compare. so, hoping could help u unpack balance headwind tailwind would drive kind greater downtick growth q4. betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer well, again, let start fiscal '25 perspective. billing tailwind going final shift annual billings, new transaction model early renewals. going get headwind co-terming business booked ahead new transaction model launch recent weeks, fx. so, again, think continued perform well executed q3. so, think feel very, strongly expectation q4. elizabeth porter -- analyst great. thank you. operator thank you. next question come line bhavin shah deutsche bank. question please, bhavin. bhavin shah -- analyst great, thanks taking question, congrats quarter. andrew, university, appeared noticeable uptick attendance session geared toward owner operators. driving recent interest segment? much product enhancement guy made versus really focusing emphasizing go-to-market perspective? long segment buyer kind becomes meaningful financials? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah, bhavin, that's excellent question, right. interested tackling whole entire life cycle design, make, construction, manufacturing, way operations. probably aware product called tandem. lot session driven increasing interest increasing adoption tandem, digital twin solution, tightly coupled solution also toolkit allows people easily connect sensor data digital twin solution. so, seeing uptick directly releasing product capability interest owner space. expect see trend continue time, expect see u continue talk owner space, continue deliver solution owner space even apis owner space. area great interest, especially come vertical buildings, factory thing related well as, infrastructure like water owner solutions. so, yes, owner matter. building software them, going see that. bhavin shah -- analyst super helpful there. then, betsy, one you. term underlying improvement seeing margins, know called fx transaction model. know early, think next year, think like impact fx transaction model kind headline operating margins? betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer well, wish could give answer, think new cfo would probably little bit problem that. so, wait till end february give specific that. bhavin shah -- analyst fair enough. thanks taking may questions. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director good try. operator thank you. next question come line tyler radke citi. please go ahead, tyler. tyler radke -- analyst yeah, good afternoon. thanks taking questions. going ask placeholder next year's guidance, betsy. want waste question that, feel free answer. andrew, wanted kind ask comment made around efficiency, especially relates hiring janesh, pointed lot experience larger companies, vmware, cisco, et cetera. quarter transaction model rollout, kind visibility better channel prior channel relationships, direct billing customer. area identified efficiency potential? think efficiency unlock, think incremental free cash flow number next year? embedded already. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director so, many layer question. right. first, let kind answer question series stage dodge ones, ok? so, first off, optimization kind mindset autodesk. something suddenly happens. want reemphasize look right now, year, example, look apples-to-apples comparison, slide decks, disclosed material see non-gaap margin already hitting target set next year year, ok? so, optimization mentality. also heard say new transaction model start roll out, optimization go-to-market effort going critical step u part optimization journey on, that's going deliver margin growth company couple year come, ok? think that's important. long-term driver. getting specifics, ok? think specific probably another time, let kind give sense thing important, right? one drive self-service, right? self-service huge impact customer engage u customer come from, value accretive autodesk, efficiency side, renewal things, also revenue growth side capturing customer directly. thing talked understanding customer better, upsell cross-sell. so, going able lot automation understanding opportunity are, that's going drive efficiencies. moving channel partner away model transactional player solution provider ip provider customers. that's going sort opportunity eliminate duplication effort drive real cost efficiency company moving forward. there's top-line efficiency revenue growth, there's bottom line efficiency well removing redundancy step necessary customer. get lot clarity see u continue move forward go-to-market optimization next year beyond that. tyler radke -- analyst great. follow-up question, andrew, talked really strong net new customer addition within construction cloud, think, doubling year year. also saw make revenue accelerate 28% constant currency. help u understand, think reacceleration durable? sort thinking position there? what's driving strength new customer additions? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director first, let comment make revenues, going go construction. so, make revenue also includes revenue pix thing associated that. however, let's talk fact around construction business think important, right? no. 1 factor continue drive consistent, high growth construction solutions. seeing it. built make numbers, lion's share make numbers. really seeing consistent growth there. that's organically. inorganically, actually executing incredibly well thing like payapps, that's driving acceleration growth. so, decelerating business, ok? actually performing solidly inorganically, accelerating, right? want really clear that. yes, said year year, drove 2x increase new customers. talk that's coming minute. also want highlight thing that's going strengthening already strong position enr 400. so, heard story power construction, great example someone taking competitive rfp say, look, need forward-looking cloud-based solution new technology go end end design construction way operations. chose us. one example gave opening commentary. so, already strengthening position enr 400. qualitative thing driving new customer growth already distribution channel operating scale. u.s., helping u go market effectively, allowing u capture customer effectively place others aren't, part driving that. also, already scale operating internationally distribution channel. so, that's driving international growth us. that's really important driver well as, net new account seeing there. last thing add done construction that, look, heard au, hearing customer lot different places. want end-to-end solution. want licensed version cloud, placing bet next 10 years. want go design construction operations, that's making solution attractive market. operator thank you. next question come line michael turrin well fargo. question, please. michael turrin -- analyst hey, thanks much. appreciate taking questions. commentary call sounded consistent, wondering added detail provide u overall macro spend environment that's maybe progressing across either key product segment geos, whatever split think useful. think trying get sense shade improvement anywhere characterize mainly consistent past couple quarters. thanks. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director michael, think core answer consistency, ok?

so, that's what's going bernini right now, continue see refinement extension moving forward. regard monetization, monetization, nobody know exactly going monetized. there's vector come play. one, ahead competitor space. intend ahead. investing stay ahead. increase one competitive position marketplace, that's really important. also, get able charge incremental feature future. delivering value high-quality outcome result, going charge outcome. charge things? let's play out, ok? still early days. there's also monetization opportunity licensing certain technology specific mature maturation specific customers' needs, right? another avenue. so, avenue play out, one wait more, let play out. need know autodesk ahead. ahead while. first ai research lab six years. published 70 papers. right cutting edge 3d design technology ai, intend stay there. operator thank you. next question come line steve tusa j.p. morgan. question please, steve. stephen tusa -- analyst good evening afternoon. lot good question asked. detailed one. what's change billing contribution transaction model change? five six five five half. simon mays-smith -- vice president, investor relation yeah. so, basically buy/sell business ahead european launch. short answer. so, remember, said 5% 6% launched europe. -- buy sell business, mean there's less tailwind new transaction model. flip side -- mean underlying increase billing guidance greater look headline basis. stephen tusa -- analyst ok, great. thanks lot. operator thank you. next question come line joshua tilton wolfe research. line open. joshua tilton -- analyst hey, guys, hear me? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah. joshua tilton -- analyst great. kind high-level one incoming cfo. heard correctly, exactly get like initial outlook revenue growth next year. trying understand context new cfo coming in, anything could change calculus guy think 10% 15% growth underlying business outside agency transition that's ongoing today. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director well, first, let's talk framework little bit, comment little bit incoming cfo. so, look, 10% 15% growth. right now, pretty much right bottom end range. look back last two years, there's series thing created headwind new business. started thing like pandemic, inflation, exiting russian business, writer's strike, whole trade war within particular geographies. thing accumulated headwind build slowly business pushed u low end range. take time subscription model thing build business, ok? so, going take time u build that. that's expected subscription model. revenue go slowly. go back slowly headwind turn tailwinds. so, expect u near bottom range short term general kind guideline core business bottom range, ok? long-term framework, 10% 15% still make sense long-term guide company. course, new eye come in, look things, evaluate them. right now, still make sense. joshua tilton -- analyst super helpful. operator thank you. next question come line siti panigrahi mizuho. question, please. siti panigrahi -- analyst thanks taking question. understand new business model kind noise expense margin side. exclude that, see operating leverage drive next year so? betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer well, think actually provided kind historically done last three year pretty clearly. think said continue focused expansion, nothing add far next year. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director provide data that. so, see underlying thing is, expect see continued improvement vector. simon mays-smith -- vice president, investor relation basis. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director basis, apples-to-apples basis. siti panigrahi -- analyst ok, great. thank you. operator thank you. next question come line michael funk bank america. question, please. michael funk -- analyst yeah. guys, thank question tonight. two, could. mentioned time last call largest multiyear cohort renewing next year also large eba cohort. wondering give u kind range potential outcome among renewal there, whether potential upsell, risk sell variance might look like around renewals? betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer no. mean think said largest cohort saw performance '23. so, expect strong renewal year, giving specific guidance look like '26 point, wait report earnings february. michael funk -- analyst ok. great. then, betsy, one more. mentioned time investment new transaction model, people processes, automation, presumably fixed cost versus variable like commission. quantify u help u modeling try forecast margin?

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Simon Mays-Smith, VP, investor relations. Please go ahead. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Thanks, operator, and good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the third quarter results of Autodesk's fiscal '25. On the line with me is Andrew Anagnost, our CEO; and Betsy Rafael, our interim CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including outlook and related assumptions and on product and strategies. Actual events or results could differ materially. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-Q and the Form 8-K filed with today's press release for important risks and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today. If this call is replayed or reviewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Autodesk disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will quote several numeric or growth changes during this call as we discuss our financial performance. Unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison. All non-GAAP numbers referenced in today's call are reconciled in our press release or Excel financials and other supplemental materials available on our Investor Relations website. And now, I will turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Simon, and welcome, everyone, to the call. We finished the third quarter of the year strongly, delivering 12% revenue growth in constant currency and have again raised full year guidance. This reflects the sustained momentum of the business and successful execution of our strategy, including a smooth implementation of the new transaction model in Western Europe. Once again, opportunity, resilience and discipline underpinned our performance. Last month at Autodesk University in San Diego, we hosted 12,000 registered attendees and another 30,000 online. We showed how granular data in the cloud, organized the data models and connected to everything through APIs to deliver even more valuable and connected solutions for customers and partners and support a much broader ecosystem and marketplace. Customers and channel partners that I spoke with at AU remain cautiously optimistic, a sentiment consistent with the underlying momentum of our business, our growing product usage and BuildingConnected bid activity trends over recent quarters. I left AU with a tremendous sense of purpose and optimism in the ingenuity and persistence of our customers and for the future. On our earnings call last quarter, I set out our secular growth opportunities and our strategy to capitalize on them. I concluded that Autodesk's investment in cloud, platform and AI in pursuit of those opportunities were ahead of its peers. AU was a good demonstration of that. But we're also leading the industry in modernizing our go-to-market motion starting a few years ago with the subscription transition through consumption and self-service enablement and more recently to direct billing. These initiatives enable Autodesk to build larger and more durable direct relationships with its customers and to serve them more efficiently. We have already seen significant benefits from initiatives like these, and there's more to come in the next optimization phase. Taking out the effects on margins from FX and the new transaction model, we still expect to be toward the midpoint of our fiscal '26 non-GAAP operating margin target of 38% to 40% in fiscal '25, a year ahead of schedule. We're confident we will make further improvement in fiscal '26 on the same basis. The new transaction model will enable tighter channel partnerships with less duplication of effort and more digital self-service and automation, which increases customer satisfaction and workforce productivity. It will also create new opportunities for partners Autodesk to earn more with less emphasis on transaction revenue sharing and a greater emphasis on value creation for customers. Once complete, we expect the new transaction model and subsequent go-to-market optimization to increase sales and marketing efficiency and deliver GAAP margins among the best in the industry. Attractive, long-term, secular growth markets, a focused strategy delivering ever more valuable and connected solutions to our customers, and a resilient business are generating strong and sustained momentum, both in absolute terms and relative to peers. Disciplined execution and capital deployment has driven even greater operational velocity and efficiency within Autodesk and will underpin the mechanical build of revenue and free cash flow over the next few years and GAAP margins among the best in the industry. We will continue to deploy capital to offset and buy forward dilution as our free cash flow grows from the fiscal '24 trough. This practice has reduced our share count over the last three years. We have significantly increased our share repurchase authorization to extend this momentum flexibility over the medium term, with the precise trajectory remaining dependent on our debt repayment schedule and the ebb and flow of M&A. In combination, we believe these factors will deliver sustainable shareholder value over many years. Before I conclude, I'd like to formally welcome Janesh to Autodesk. We're excited to welcome Janesh, who brings a wealth of experience and will be instrumental in sustaining Autodesk's growth and enhanced profitability momentum. Of equal importance, I'd like to thank Betsy for stepping in as interim CFO at an important time in the company's journey, and I'm looking forward to continuing to work closely with her as an Autodesk Board member. I will now turn the call over to Betsy to discuss our quarterly financial performance and guidance for the year. I'll then return to provide an update on our strategic growth initiatives. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Andrew. Q3 was another strong quarter. We generated broad-based underlying growth across products and regions. In addition, we saw revenue increases from the new transaction model and M&A which were offset by the absence of enterprise business agreement true-ups from Q3 last year and FX. Our Make products continued to enhance growth, driven by our ongoing strength in construction and Fusion. Overall, macroeconomic policy and geopolitical challenges and the underlying momentum of the business were consistent with the last few quarters, with continued strong renewal rates and headwinds to our new business growth. Total revenue grew 11% and 12% in constant currency. By product, in constant currency, AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT revenue grew 8%. AEC revenue, which was most impacted by the absence of true-up revenues, grew 12%, Manufacturing revenue grew 16% and still comfortably in double digits, excluding upfront revenue. And M&E revenue grew 15% boosted by the PIX acquisition and associated integration adjustments. By region, in constant currency, revenue grew 11% in the Americas which was most impacted by the absence of true-up revenues, 13% in EMEA and 14% in APAC. The mechanical contribution from the new transaction model to revenue was $17 million in the third quarter and $25 million on a year-to-date basis. Direct revenue increased 23% and represented 42% of total revenue, up 4 percentage points from last year, benefiting from strong growth in both EBAs and the Autodesk store and also the natural tailwind to revenue from the new transaction model. Net revenue retention rate remained within the 100% to 110% range at constant exchange rates. Billings increased 28% in the quarter, reflecting a tailwind from the prior-year shift to annual billings for most multiyear contracts, early renewals and the natural tailwind from the transition to the new transaction model. Similar to last quarter, and as expected, co-terming negatively impacted billing ahead of the launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe. The natural contribution from the new transaction model to billing was $72 million in the third quarter and $108 million on a year-to-date basis. Total deferred revenue decreased 9% to $3.7 billion and was again impacted by the transition from upfront to annual billings for multiyear contracts. Total RPO of $6.1 billion and current RPO of $4.0 billion grew 17% and 14%, respectively, which reflects a tailwind from early renewals and the new transaction model and a headwind from the declining contribution of billed and unbilled deferred revenue from large, multiyear and EBA cohorts ahead of renewal in fiscal '26. Excluding these, current RPO growth was broadly consistent with Q2. We do expect the new transaction model and the larger FY '26 renewal cohorts to have a greater impact on both RPO and current RPO growth in Q4 of fiscal '25. Turning to margins. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were broadly low. With Autodesk University shifting back to Q3 this year from Q4 last year, GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins decreased by 2 and 3 percentage points, respectively. The timing effect from AU obviously washes out over the full year. At current course and speed, the ratio of stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue peaked in fiscal '24, will follow by more than a percentage point in fiscal '25 and will be below 10% over time. Free cash flow for the quarter was $199 million. This benefited from some channel partners in Western Europe booking business earlier in the quarter ahead of the transition to the new transaction model really to derisk month one after the transition. This accelerated free cash flow to the third quarter, which was partially offset by the expected negative impact of co-terming in Western Europe. Turning now to capital allocation. We continue to actively manage capital within our framework and deploy it with discipline and focus through the economic cycle to drive long-term shareholder value. As expected, the pace of buybacks picked up in the third quarter. We purchased approximately 1.2 million shares for $319 million at an average price of approximately $269 per share. We will continue to deploy capital to offset and buy forward dilution as our free cash flow grows from the fiscal '24 trough. This practice has reduced our share count by about 5 million shares over the last three years with an average percentage reduction of about 70 basis points per year. We increased the amount authorized under our share repurchase program by $5 billion for a total of approximately $9 billion. This expands our flexibility over the medium term with the precise trajectory remaining dependent on our debt repayment schedule as well as, the ebbs and flow of M&A. Now let me finish with guidance. As we said in the February, the pace of the rollout of the new transaction model will create noise in billings and the P&L. So, we think free cash flow is the best measure of our performance. Taking out that noise, the underlying momentum in the business remains consistent with the expectations embedded in our guidance range for the full year with continued strong renewal rates and headwinds to new business growth. Our sustained momentum in the third quarter and smooth launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe, reduced the likelihood of our more cautious forecast scenario. Given that, we're raising the midpoint of our billing, revenue, margin, earnings per share and free cash flow guidance ranges. So, let me give you a little bit more detail. The underlying momentum of billing is in line with our expectations. Compared to our modeling at the start of the year, the launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe in Q3 and early renewals have been a tailwind for billings, whereas more co-terming, more business done under the old buy-sell model before the launch of the new transaction model and in recent weeks, FX movement have been headwinds for billing. We now estimate that the new transaction model will provide between a 5 and 5.5 percentage point tailwind to billings growth in fiscal '25. We've raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 billings guidance by $10 million to a range of $5.90 billion to $5.98 billion. The underlying momentum of revenue is also in line with our expectations. We estimate the new transaction model will provide around 1 to 1.5 percentage point tailwind to revenue growth in fiscal '25. Upfront revenue contributed 2 percentage points to revenue growth in Q4 of fiscal '24, and therefore, this is a headwind in Q4 of fiscal '25. While not large enough to call out at the start of the year, it was already factored into our Q4 and our full year model. We've raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 revenue guidance range by $18 million to a range of $6.12 billion to $6.13 billion. We're increasing our GAAP and non-GAAP margin guidance midpoint by 25 basis points by raising the bottom end of the ranges by 50 basis points. The GAAP margin guidance range is now 21.5% to 22%. The non-GAAP margin guidance range is now 35.5% to 36%, which includes a 1 to 1.5 percentage point underlying margin improvement, broadly offset by the margin headwinds from the new transaction model and the related incremental investments in people, processes and automation. The underlying momentum of free cash flow is also in line with our expectations. The headwind to billings from co-terming and FX rates that I mentioned earlier, is being offset by early renewals, faster collections and improved underlying margins. We raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 free cash flow guidance by $10 million and tightened the range to $1.47 billion to $1.5 billion. We expect strong free cash flow growth in fiscal '26 because of the return of our largest multiyear renewal cohort the natural mechanical stacking of multiyear contracts billed annually and a larger EBA cohort. With our current trajectory, we still estimate free cash flow in fiscal '26 to be around $2.05 billion at the midpoint. The slide deck on our website has more details on modeling assumptions for Q3 and for the full fiscal year '25. And while this may be my last earnings call for Autodesk, I will stick around for a bit to ensure a smooth transition to Janesh. Thank you, Andrew, and everyone at Autodesk for your support while I was here and to the many investors and the analysts with whom I've had lively discussions over the last few quarters. While the transition to annual billings for multiyear contracts and the deployment of the new transaction model has created noise and billings in the P&L, they do provide a natural near-term tailwind to revenue and free cash flow growth. Combined with a resilient business model, sustained competitive momentum, Autodesk has enviable sources of visibility and certainty to very uncertain world. For all these reasons, I stepped down from my role as interim CFO with tremendous optimism for the future. Andrew, back to you. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Betsy. Let me finish by updating you on our strong progress in the third quarter. We continue to see good momentum in AEC, particularly in infrastructure and construction, fueled by customers consolidating onto our solutions to connect and optimize previously siloed workflows through the cloud. The cornerstone of that growing interest is our comprehensive end-to-end solutions in completing designs, preconstruction, field execution through handover and into operations. This breadth of connected capability enables us to extend our footprint further into infrastructure and construction and also expand our reach into the mid-market. As a sign of our growing momentum as the benefits of our end-to-end solution become more apparent, our construction business continue to perform robustly with net new customers doubling year over year and existing customers' renewal and expansion rates remaining strong. Let me give you a few examples. Power Construction is No. 79 on the Engineering News Record, ENR Top 400 U.S. contractor list. It is a Chicago-based general contractor serving residential and nonresidential end markets. After completing a competitive RFP to replace its legacy project management tool, Power selected Autodesk for its unified construction platform across preconstruction, construction, and DDC. By standardizing on Autodesk Construction Cloud, Power will have a single source of truth for project data, enhanced collaboration capabilities, and streamlined workflows on a single platform. Power Construction was one of two ENR 400 top 100 U.S. contractors that standardized enterprisewide on Autodesk build during the quarter. In Europe, Bouygues, a top 10 ENR 250 international contractor based in France and a leader in sustainable building and infrastructure projects renewed and expanded its EBA in the quarter. Bouygues is continuing to consolidate on Autodesk solutions across the enterprise, including broader adoption of Autodesk Forma, Carbon Insight, and Informed Design to digitize, decarbonize, and industrialize projects. It also significantly increased its commitment to Autodesk Construction Cloud to drive efficiency gains and faster bid response times through better collaboration between design and project teams. Surbana Jurong is No. 23 on ENR's top 225 international design firms. Based in Singapore, it is an urban infrastructure and integrated solutions consulting firm. In Q3, it renewed its third EBA, which included increased investment in Autodesk Construction Cloud and Autodesk Water infrastructure solutions. ACC is helping to scale its operations through increased automation, integrated design workflows and enhanced collaboration across time zones. Our water infrastructure solutions will be a core technology supporting its growth ambitions in planning, designing, engineering and managing water projects for customers worldwide. Again, these stories have a common theme. Managing people, processes and data across the project life cycle to increase efficiency and sustainability while decreasing risk. Over time, we expect the majority of all projects to be managed this way, and we remain focused on enabling that transition through our industry cloud. Moving on to manufacturing. We made excellent progress on our strategic initiatives. Customers continue to invest in their digital transformation and consolidate our Design and Make platform. Fusion remains one of the fastest-growing products in the manufacturing industry. As customers seek to drive innovation and growth at lower cost, Fusion extension attach rates are increasing, which is helping to drive the average sales price higher. For example, in the quarter, a global manufacturer supplying the semiconductor industry selected Fusion Manage and Vault PLM over competitive solutions to foster greater collaboration across manufacturing sites and improve operating efficiency. Once fully scaled and operational, this customer expects to save 105,000 hours per year by connecting people and data, resulting in reduced product development costs and faster time to market. In the U.K., Playdale Playground has been designing, manufacturing, and installing outdoor playground equipment for over 40 years. This quarter, Playdale added Fusion to its existing portfolio of Autodesk solutions, including Inventor, AutoCAD, and Vault to streamline and digitize workflows, optimize production to reduce lead times, reduce nonconformities, and replace inefficient Excel-driven operations on the shop floor. A long time Autodesk customer and global leader in precision engineering solutions renewed and expanded its EBA in the quarter. In addition to Inventor, vault and AutoCAD, it is adopting Fusion's generative design capabilities for material waste reduction and fluid flow optimization and Moldflow to reduce manufacturing costs and defects while increasing mold yields. In education, universities continue to modernize their courses and curriculum to attract and prepare future engineers. For example, from this winter, students at the University of Stuttgart, Institute for Medical Device Technology will use Fusion across six courses. Fusion was selected to replace a competitive solution for its modern platform, ease of use, cloud collaboration capabilities and unique combination of PCB and additive manufacturing workflows in a single team environment. And lastly, we continue to work with our customers to ensure they are using the latest and most secure versions of our software. For example, after a period of rapid scaling and diversification, a large multinational manufacturing company in APAC was looking to align compliance rates across its global employee base. Working collaboratively we address compliance issues while cementing a long-term partnership and completing one of our largest ever license compliance agreements, which included expanded adoption of Alias and VRED for the Design Studio and PDMC for mechanical engineering and rail design. Attractive long-term secular growth markets, a focused strategy delivering ever more valuable and connected solutions to our customers and a resilient business are generating strong and sustained momentum both in absolute terms and relative to peers. Disciplined execution and capital deployment is driving an even greater operational velocity and efficiency within Autodesk, and we continue to deploy capital to deliver sustainable shareholder value over many years. I retain a tremendous sense of purpose and optimism in the ingenuity and persistence of our customers and for the future. Operator, we would now like to open the call up for questions. Questions & Answers: Operator Thank you. [Operator instructions] Again, please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Jason Celino of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your question, please. Jason Celino -- Analyst Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Just two for me. The first one, Andrew. Some of us are unfamiliar with Janesh. Can you just tell us a little bit more about him and what he brings to Autodesk? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director I certainly can. Before I do that, let me make sure that I thank Betsy for everything she brought to Autodesk during this interim period. I really appreciate it. The company appreciates it. Thank you, Betsy. Now we're really excited about Janesh. Let me tell you why we're excited about Janesh. As you remember, one of the things I was telling you that I was looking for was someone that was going to be able to dispassionately drive optimization at scale inside of Autodesk. And what that really means is someone that's going to be really inwardly focused, looking at every dollar that we invest and making sure that we're getting the most return for the business that investors are getting the best return from their business. The next kind of criteria we were looking for, which was nice to have was, time in the seat as a sitting CFO, which was important for us as well. But it was kind of the next nice to have after the optimization at scale. Janesh brings a great balance of both of those things, right? He's been in the seat seven years at Elastic, both CFO and COO, driving some fairly turbulent changes inside of Elastic. So, he's got battle stars from pushing inside the company to get changes done inside, and we like that. We like that a lot. He's also got very good early experience at companies that we feel have always added value to Autodesk. So, he was it VMware in a senior position. He was at Cisco in a senior position. We've had good success bringing people from those kind of companies. He worked at those companies driving optimization at scale, which is the No. 1 criteria I was looking for when we we're driving this work. He also has another nice to have. He's got knowledge of our industry. He spent two years at PTC in his career. He was actually recently on the PTC board. So, he understands our industry, and he'll be able to get up to speed pretty quickly. The No. 1 goal here drive optimization and scale over the next few years, make sure that we're getting everything we need from every dollar we invest, which is a very important theme for Autodesk. And with that, I'm really excited, and I'm looking forward to him joining in December. Jason Celino -- Analyst OK. Great. Interesting. And then for my second question, now that you do have a CFO, do you have any thoughts on when you might hold the next Investor Day? I think in the past, you usually did it in March. Is that a good time frame? Or is that too soon? Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. Well, Janesh is joining in December. I think we need to give him time to get his sea legs on giving time to kind of drive the end of the year and actually get us set up for next fiscal year in good stead. So, I would say it's unlikely we'll be doing anything in the spring, but we'll get back to you on that as soon as Janesh is ready to talk about those things. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Your question, please. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst Thank you. Andrew, as of the third quarter, your three-year CAGR for current RPO is about 12%. How are you thinking about the sustainability or perhaps improvement upon that CAGR or CRPO over the next number of years? When we think about the ingredients of that, it looks like over the last several years, the CAGR for your unit volume for all brands is roughly 6% to 7% in the aggregate. So, on top of that, you've had price and other ingredients, but perhaps talk about how you think you might be able to improve upon the most recent trajectory for current RPO. Then my follow-up. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Hi, Jay, this is Betsy. Let me just give you a couple of things. There's a number of things that are going on, on the headline of the CRPO number. If you first take away the headwinds and the tailwinds was broadly consistent with the second quarter. And as I mentioned in my opening commentary, early renewals and growth with -- and the new transaction model are providing a tailwind. And then there's also a headwind to CRPO growth from the declining contribution of billed and unbilled deferred revenue risk from the large multiyear EBA cohorts coming up for renewal in fiscal '26. And just as a reminder, these are the same larger cohorts we are calling out as the tailwinds to free cash flow for next year. And if you look back to fiscal '22, we saw the same dynamic ahead of the fiscal '23 renewals as well. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst OK. Since new management is part of the news this evening, could you talk about how you're thinking about the chief revenue officer position. Would it make sense perhaps to continue to have a separate CRO? Or do you think it might make more sense perhaps to combine CRO and COO? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, we're going to continue to have a separate CRO because we have various functions that work together there under the COO organization, including our IT organization, our infrastructure and all things associated. What we're looking for in our CRO is someone that understands how to continue to drive a business when you have direct engagement with the customer. So, that means someone that really understands what it takes to analyze self-service patterns, actually understand the data that comes in from the customers to help drive cross-sell and upsell while also transforming a channel from a transactionally focused extension of Autodesk to kind of a solution partner that's driving life cycle solutions for our customers. So, that's the kind of role we're looking for here. And yes, it's going to continue to be a stand-alone CRO role within the COO organization. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Borg of Stifel. Your line is open. Adam Borg -- Analyst Awesome. Thanks so much for taking the questions, and congrats to Betsy and Janesh. Maybe on the new transaction model. I know it's still early. But I was just curious, are there any learnings from those customers that are on the new model that you're seeing in terms of the adoption of Autodesk technology and the ability to find white space to better upsell and cross-sell different solutions now that you have a more direct relationship. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah, Adam, it's really early on to be able to make any kind of conclusions about that. What I can tell you is that we definitely see some shifts to some of the direct channels at Autodesk for customers that were probably just served on a very kind of arm's length kind of transactional level. But in terms of driving cross-sell and upsell, early days, early days. But if you want to get a sense for how that might evolve, we've got experience with our EBAs and our enterprise business agreements. And we've learned over the years that having that kind of relationship with the customer where we really understand their usage patterns, who they are and what they're doing, we are much more effective at driving cross-sell and upsell even when partnering with our channel partners. So, I think those kind of stand as a testament of what's possible as we move forward with completion of the new transaction model. Adam Borg -- Analyst Great. And maybe just as a quick follow-up. Just as we think about the new administration coming in, you talked about the macro being broadly consistent. Any change in tone in your conversations with the end markets in terms of optimism or their ability or willingness to expand new projects ahead of the administration? Any pause or just full steam ahead? I'm just curious, any commentary you have there from a macro perspective would be really, really helpful. Thanks so much. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director What I'll say is the things that matter to our customers are bipartisan things, all right? Our customers care about infrastructure builds out. Both parties care about infrastructure build-outs. Our customers care about domestic manufacturing in Europe, be it in the United States, both parties agree that the domestic manufacturing build-outs are important. Supply chain, independent, supply chain stability. All of these things are bipartisan issues that really affect our customers. So, regardless of the administration, I suspect the things that are important to our customers are continuing to be a focus. Adam Borg -- Analyst Thanks, again. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink of Baird. Please go ahead, Joe. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst Thank you. On the outlook for next year, $2.050 billion in free cash has, I think, been the expectation for the past year now. Within the last year, you've also seen more co-term of contracts. And I think that leads to better billings in FY '26. So, my question is, does that actually create the potential that things are better, and that's why you're qualifying now the $2.050 billion as the midpoint of possibilities. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer There's no change to how we've talked about the free cash flow guide for fiscal '26, it continues to be $2.05 billion at the mid-point. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst OK. Fair enough. And then just on the M&A environment, over recent history, Autodesk has been more in a mode of, I would say, strategic tuck-ins. I think there is actually an asset in the CFD simulation space that was announced during AU in the quarter. Is that the right approach for Autodesk, just given this point in time, all the work you've done to build out the cloud platform, the data models, and so these tuck-ins make the most sense? And if that's true, how would you maybe compare and contrast some of the larger-scale M&A that's happening with your peers in the space? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, look, consolidation in our space is inevitable. I'm not going to comment on any specific deals, but here's what I'll say. Autodesk has always been an acquisitive company, and we will be an inquisitive company when that makes both strategic and financial sense for the company. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst OK. Thank you. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Joe. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Porter of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Elizabeth. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great, thanks so much for the question. As partners are getting customers just up and running on the new transaction model, we picked up that they're spending a little bit more time than usual of time and resources with those existing customers. So, I was curious if that had any impact on new business demand kind of more recently -- and then just more broadly, any change in new business trends that you think you should call out from versus last quarter? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Elizabeth, it's Betsy. And so, just broadly speaking, we continue to see growth, but at a slower pace due to a number of factors really over the last several years, macro, COVID, exiting Russia, elections, and while a drag on the forward momentum of the business, all of that really factored into our guidance. So, I kind of just will leave it at that. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great. And then a follow-up just on billings. I understand there's a lot of volatility around the change from multiyear in the transaction model. But it looks like guidance implies a bigger step down in growth in Q4, just despite easier year-ago compare. So, hoping that you could help us unpack the balance of those headwinds and tailwinds that would drive kind of a greater downtick in growth in Q4. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, again, let me start out with just from a fiscal '25 perspective. Your billing tailwinds are going to be from the final shift to annual billings, new transaction model and early renewals. And you're going to get headwinds from co-terming and business booked ahead of the new transaction model launch and in recent weeks, some FX. So, again, I think that we've continued to perform well as we've executed through through Q3. And so, I think we feel very, very strongly about our expectations for Q4. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bhavin Shah of Deutsche Bank. Your question please, Bhavin. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Great, thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the quarter. Andrew, at university, there appeared to be a noticeable uptick in attendance and sessions geared toward owners and operators. What been driving the recent interest from the segment? How much of it is product enhancements you guys have made versus really more focusing and emphasizing from a go-to-market perspective? And how long before this segment of buyers kind of becomes more meaningful to the financials? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah, Bhavin, that's an excellent question, right. We're very interested in tackling the whole entire life cycle from design, through make, construction, manufacturing, all the way into operations. You're probably aware we have a product called Tandem. And a lot of those sessions were driven by increasing interest and increasing adoption of Tandem, which is a digital twin solution, tightly coupled to our solutions that also has a toolkit that allows people to easily connect sensor data through the digital twin solution. So, you're seeing that uptick because we're directly releasing products and capabilities that are of interest to the owner space. You can expect to see that trend continue over time, and you can expect to see us continue to talk about the owner space, continue to deliver solutions for the owner space and even APIs for the owner space. It's an area of great interest, especially when it comes not only to vertical buildings, but factories and other things that are related to that as well as, infrastructure like what we were doing with some of our water owner solutions. So, yes, owners matter. We're building software for them, and you're going to see more of that. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Super helpful there. And then, Betsy, one for you. Just in terms of the underlying improvement that we've been seeing in the margins, and I know you've called out FX and the transaction model. I know it's very early, but as you think about next year, how do we think about like the impact of FX and the transaction model to kind of the headline operating margins? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, I wish I could give you that answer, but I think that the new CFO would probably have a little bit of a problem with that. So, we'll wait till the end of February to give you more specifics on that. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Fair enough. Thanks for taking may questions. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Good try. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke of Citi. Please go ahead, Tyler. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Yeah, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I was going to ask you about a placeholder for next year's guidance, Betsy. don't want to waste a question on that, but feel free to answer. But Andrew, I wanted to kind of ask you about some of your comments you made around efficiency, especially as it relates to hiring Janesh, who you pointed out has a lot of experience at larger companies, VMware, Cisco, et cetera. Now that you're a few quarters into this transaction model rollout, you have kind of visibility better on some of the channel prior channel relationships, having that direct billing with the customer. What are some of the areas that you've identified as having that efficiency potential? And then as we think about that efficiency unlock, should we think about that as incremental to the free cash flow number you have out for next year? Or is that embedded in that already. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director So, many layers to that question. All right. First, let me kind of answer the question in a series of stages then dodge other ones, OK? So, first off, optimization is kind of a mindset at Autodesk. It's not something that that suddenly happens. I want to reemphasize that because if you look right now, this year, for example, when you look at the apples-to-apples comparison, which will be in the slide decks, are in our disclosed materials you can see that our non-GAAP margins are already hitting the targets we set for next year this year, OK? So, optimization is a mentality. You've also heard me say over and over again as the new transaction model starts to roll out, optimization of our go-to-market efforts is going to be a critical step for us and part of the optimization journey that we're on, that's going to deliver margin growth for the company for couple of years to come, OK? And I think that's important. It's a long-term driver. Now with getting into the specifics, OK? I think the specifics are probably for another time, but let me just kind of give you a sense for some of the things that are important, right? One is the drive to self-service, right? Self-service is a huge impact on how our customers will engage with us and where those customers come from, and that is value accretive to Autodesk, both on an efficiency side, from renewals and other things, but also on the revenue growth side through capturing the customers directly. The other thing I talked about is understanding the customer better, so the upsell and cross-sell. So, we're going to be able to do a lot more automation and understanding about where the opportunities are, and that's going to drive some efficiencies. And we're moving the channel partners away from this model of being the transactional players to being the solution providers and the IP providers to our customers. That's going to have all sorts of opportunities to eliminate duplication of effort and drive real cost efficiencies for the company moving forward. There's both top-line efficiencies here in revenue growth, but there's bottom line efficiencies as well through removing the redundancies and steps that just aren't necessary for the customer. You'll get a lot more clarity on that as you see us continue to move forward with this go-to-market optimization in the next year and beyond that. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Great. And then my follow-up question, Andrew, you talked about some really strong net new customer additions within the Construction Cloud, I think, doubling year over year. we also saw the Make revenue accelerate to 28% constant currency. Can you just help us understand, do you think that reacceleration is durable? And how are you sort of thinking about just your position there? What's been driving that strength in the new customer additions? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director First, let me comment on the make revenues, then I'm going to go into construction. So, the make revenue also includes some revenue from PIX and things associated with that. However, let's talk about the facts around our construction business because I think this is important, right? No. 1 factor is that we continue to drive consistent, high growth in our construction solutions. You're seeing it. It's built into the Make numbers, and it's the lion's share of those Make numbers. You're really seeing some consistent growth there. That's organically. Inorganically, we're actually executing incredibly well on things like Payapps, and that's driving acceleration of our growth. So, we are not decelerating as a business, OK? We are actually performing solidly inorganically, we're accelerating, all right? And I just want to be really clear about that. And yes, we said year over year, we drove a 2x increase in our new customers. And I'll talk about where some of that's coming from in just a minute. But I also want to highlight the other thing that's going on we are strengthening an already strong position in the ENR 400. So, you heard about the story about power construction, which was a great example of someone taking out a competitive RFP and say, look, I need a forward-looking cloud-based solution on new technology that goes end to end from design to construction all the way to operations. And they chose us. And that was just one example that we gave in the opening commentary. So, already a strengthening position in the ENR 400. Now the other qualitative things that are driving some of that new customer growth is we already have our distribution channel operating at scale. In the U.S., this is helping us go down market more effectively, which is allowing us to capture more customers more effectively be places where we weren't before and where others aren't, which is part of driving that. But also, we're already at scale operating internationally with our distribution channel. So, that's driving international growth for us. And that's a really important driver as well as, some of those net new accounts that you're seeing there. And the last thing I'll add that I'm done with construction is that, look, I heard this over and over again at AU, I'm hearing it over and over again from customers in lots of different places. They want the end-to-end solution. They want the licensed version in the cloud, they're placing bets for the next 10 years. They want to go from design to construction to operations, and that's just making our solution more attractive to the market. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo. Your question, please. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Hey, thanks very much. I appreciate you taking the questions. A commentary on the call sounded consistent, but wondering if there are any added details you can provide for us on just the overall macro spend environment and how that's maybe progressing across either key product segments or geos, whatever split you think is more useful. I think what we're trying to get a sense for is if there are any shades of improvement anywhere or if you'd characterize as mainly just consistent over the past couple of quarters. Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Michael, I think the core answer here is consistency, OK? We're seeing consistent trends that we've seen with -- in all the other quarters. There's always puts and takes in a large business like ours, especially ones as divers as ours. But the general tone is consistent with prior quarters. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer And I would just add that there's also been a lot of noise this year from the new transaction model and then obviously, the elections and leading up to that. And so, it's hard to sparse out kind of that particular behavior. So, I think as Andrew said, we call it consistent. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Yeah, tough for us, too. That's why we keep asking. Betsy, congrats on the transition back given you're also on the board. I think it'd be useful to hear you chime in on the hiring of Janesh and maybe just also comment on how you ensure you're able to hand over the reins and keep progress going on the key transitions the company is working through. Thanks. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Per se, I was involved in the process, which was quite extensive in the company and the recruiting of Janesh. And so, we're certainly very excited to have him on board. What I would also say is, obviously, with my experience of being on the board for 11 years as well as, my deep dive into the business over the last six months. One of the reasons I'm staying around until the end of the fiscal year, is I think I could be really helpful in that transition for Janesh. And so, I'm very much looking forward to it. And I think that we have a great finance team, and I think that he's going to fit very well, and I'm looking forward to making that happen as fast as we can. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. Your question, please, Matthew. Mike Richards -- Analyst Hey, guys. This is Mike Richards on for Matt. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could provide an update on Project Bernini and maybe how customer reception has been and where we are in developing other foundational models or just the monetization opportunity there? Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, first off, before I comment on Bernini, as you might have heard from AU, AI is embedded in everything we're doing from a bottom-up and a top-down perspective. And you also heard us talk at AU about new types of foundation models we're building that understand how certain things are done in our applications. You heard about a foundation model that's driving automated drawing creation. You heard about a foundation model that's driving automated sketch generation and sketch constraints. That kind of stuff is bottom-up innovation. Bernini more of a top-down type innovation where you're actually specifying things and trying to generate a preliminary outcome from those specifications. And what we've been doing with Bernini is we've been trying to engage with certain targeted customers to get them to participate with us in making Bernini smarter and more intelligent. It's not available commercially right now. but it's getting more intelligent. We've actually been successful in getting some customers to stand up and say, look, yes, I'd like to work with you to make this more intelligent because we need something that actually understands 3D geometry as geometry, not just in the picture or something, OK? So, that's what's going on with Bernini right now, and you should continue to see refinements and extensions of that moving forward. Now with regard to monetization, monetization, nobody knows exactly how all this is going to be monetized. But there's a few vectors here that that come into play. One, we are ahead of our competitors in this space. We intend to be ahead. We're investing to stay ahead. That increase ones competitive position in the marketplace, and that's really important. Also, you get to be able to charge for some of these incremental features in the future. When you're delivering value or a high-quality outcome as a result, you're going to charge for that outcome. How we charge for those things? Let's just play out, OK? It's still early days. But there's also monetization opportunities through licensing certain technologies for specific mature maturation for specific customers' needs, all right? And that will be another avenue. So, how these avenues play out, which one waits more, let this play out. But what you need to know about Autodesk is we're ahead. We've been ahead for a while. We were the first out there with an AI research lab that been out there for over six years. It's published 70 papers. We're right on the cutting edge of 3D design technology in AI, and we intend to stay there. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of J.P. Morgan. Your question please, Steve. Stephen Tusa -- Analyst Good evening or afternoon. Lots of good questions asked. Just a detailed one. What's the change in the billings contribution from the transaction model change? The five to six to five to five and a half. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Yeah. So, it's basically because we did more buy/sell business ahead of the European launch. It's short answer. So, remember, we said 5% to 6% when we launched Europe. And it was the -- we did more buy sell business, which means there's less tailwind from the new transaction model. The flip side of -- that means that the underlying increase in our billings guidance is greater than it looks on a headline basis. Stephen Tusa -- Analyst OK, great. Thanks a lot. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Tilton of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Hey, guys, can you hear me? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Great. I have a kind of a high-level one on the incoming CFO. If I heard correctly, we didn't exactly get like an initial outlook for revenue growth for next year. And I'm just trying to understand in the context of the new CFO coming in, is there anything that could change the calculus of how you guys think about that 10% to 15% growth for the underlying business outside of the agency transition that's ongoing today. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Well, first, let's talk about that framework a little bit, and then I'll comment a little bit on the incoming CFO. So, look, the 10% to 15% growth. Right now, we're pretty much right at the bottom end of that range. And if we look back over the last two years, there's been a series of things that created headwinds to new business. It started off with things like the pandemic, the inflation, the exiting of the Russian business, the writer's strike, the whole trade wars within particular geographies. All of these things were accumulated headwinds that build slowly into the business and have pushed us down to the low end of the range. it takes time in a subscription model for those things to build out of the business, OK? So, it's going to take time for us to build out of that. That's to be expected with a subscription model. The revenue goes down slowly. It goes back up slowly as headwinds turn into tailwinds. So, expect us to be near the bottom of that range in the short term just as a general kind of guideline for the core business to be at the bottom of the range, OK? As a long-term framework, the 10% to 15% still makes sense as a long-term guide for the company. But of course, as new eyes come in, we'll look at these things, and we'll evaluate them. But right now, this all still makes sense. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Super helpful. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho. Your question, please. Siti Panigrahi -- Analyst Thanks for taking my question. I understand the new business model of some kind of noise in your expense and margin side. But if you exclude that, where do you see some of the operating leverage that you can drive in next year or so? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, I think we've actually provided kind of historically what we've done over the last three years pretty clearly. And I think we said that we continue to be focused on expansion, but nothing further to add as far as next year. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director We did provide data on that. So, you can see what underlying thing is, and we expect to see continued improvement in that same vector. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations On the same basis. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director On the same basis, on the same apples-to-apples basis. Siti Panigrahi -- Analyst OK, great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Funk of Bank of America. Your question, please. Michael Funk -- Analyst Yeah. Guys, thank you for the question tonight. Two, if I could. You've mentioned a few times in the last calls about the largest multiyear cohort renewing next year and then also a large EBA cohort. Just wondering if you can give us kind of the range of potential outcomes among the renewals there, whether a potential to upsell, risk of down sell and what that variance might look like around those renewals? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer No. I mean I think what we have said is that it's the largest cohort and we saw that performance in '23. And so, we expect a strong renewal year, but we're not giving any specific guidance on what that looks like for '26 at this point, and we'll wait until we report earnings in February. Michael Funk -- Analyst OK. Great. And then, Betsy, one more. You've mentioned a few times after the investment in new transaction model, people processes, and automation, presumably more fixed cost versus variable like commission. Can you quantify that for us to help us with modeling as we try to forecast margin? I know you've not given guidance, but better understanding of what that cost might actually be on an absolute basis would help us to think about our modeling. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Mike, we've got a slide in the earnings deck to help you think about modeling. And I'll just point you to that. Michael Funk -- Analyst OK, great. Thank you, Simon. Operator Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for Q&A today. I would now like to turn the conference back to Simon Mays-Smith for closing remarks. Sir? Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Great. Thanks, Latif, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Looking forward to seeing many of you on the road over the next few weeks. If you have any questions in the meantime, please email me or call me. And in the meantime, for those of you in North America wishing you a very happy Thanksgiving. Thank you, Latif.

seat seven year elastic, cfo coo, driving fairly turbulent change inside elastic. so, got battle star pushing inside company get change done inside, like that. like lot. also got good early experience company feel always added value autodesk. so, vmware senior position. cisco senior position. good success bringing people kind companies. worked company driving optimization scale, no. 1 criterion looking driving work. also another nice have. got knowledge industry. spent two year ptc career. actually recently ptc board. so, understands industry, able get speed pretty quickly. no. 1 goal drive optimization scale next years, make sure getting everything need every dollar invest, important theme autodesk. that, really excited, looking forward joining december. jason celino -- analyst ok. great. interesting. second question, cfo, thought might hold next investor day? think past, usually march. good time frame? soon? thanks. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah. well, janesh joining december. think need give time get sea leg giving time kind drive end year actually get u set next fiscal year good stead. so, would say unlikely anything spring, get back soon janesh ready talk things. operator thank you. next question come line jay vleeschhouwer griffin securities. question, please. jay vleeschhouwer -- analyst thank you. andrew, third quarter, three-year cagr current rpo 12%. thinking sustainability perhaps improvement upon cagr crpo next number years? think ingredient that, look like last several years, cagr unit volume brand roughly 6% 7% aggregate. so, top that, price ingredients, perhaps talk think might able improve upon recent trajectory current rpo. follow-up. betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer yeah. hi, jay, betsy. let give couple things. there's number thing going on, headline crpo number. first take away headwind tailwind broadly consistent second quarter. mentioned opening commentary, early renewal growth -- new transaction model providing tailwind. there's also headwind crpo growth declining contribution billed unbilled deferred revenue risk large multiyear eba cohort coming renewal fiscal '26. reminder, larger cohort calling tailwind free cash flow next year. look back fiscal '22, saw dynamic ahead fiscal '23 renewal well. jay vleeschhouwer -- analyst ok. since new management part news evening, could talk thinking chief revenue officer position. would make sense perhaps continue separate cro? think might make sense perhaps combine cro coo? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah. so, going continue separate cro various function work together coo organization, including organization, infrastructure thing associated. looking cro someone understands continue drive business direct engagement customer. so, mean someone really understands take analyze self-service patterns, actually understand data come customer help drive cross-sell upsell also transforming channel transactionally focused extension autodesk kind solution partner that's driving life cycle solution customers. so, that's kind role looking here. yes, going continue stand-alone cro role within coo organization. jay vleeschhouwer -- analyst thank much. operator thank you. next question come line adam borg stifel. line open. adam borg -- analyst awesome. thanks much taking questions, congrats betsy janesh. maybe new transaction model. know still early. curious, learning customer new model seeing term adoption autodesk technology ability find white space better upsell cross-sell different solution direct relationship. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah, adam, really early able make kind conclusion that. tell definitely see shift direct channel autodesk customer probably served kind arm's length kind transactional level. term driving cross-sell upsell, early days, early days. want get sense might evolve, got experience ebas enterprise business agreements. learned year kind relationship customer really understand usage patterns, doing, much effective driving cross-sell upsell even partnering channel partners. so, think kind stand testament what's possible move forward completion new transaction model. adam borg -- analyst great. maybe quick follow-up. think new administration coming in, talked macro broadly consistent. change tone conversation end market term optimism ability willingness expand new project ahead administration? pause full steam ahead? curious, commentary macro perspective would really, really helpful. thanks much. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director say thing matter customer bipartisan things, right? customer care infrastructure build out. party care infrastructure build-outs. customer care domestic manufacturing europe, united states, party agree domestic manufacturing build-outs important. supply chain, independent, supply chain stability. thing bipartisan issue really affect customers. so, regardless administration, suspect thing important customer continuing focus. adam borg -- analyst thanks, again. operator thank you. next question come line joe vruwink baird. please go ahead, joe. joe vruwink -- analyst thank you. outlook next year, $2.050 billion free cash has, think, expectation past year now. within last year, also seen co-term contracts. think lead better billing fy '26. so, question is, actually create potential thing better, that's qualifying $2.050 billion midpoint possibilities. betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer there's change talked free cash flow guide fiscal '26, continues $2.05 billion mid-point. joe vruwink -- analyst ok. fair enough. m&a environment, recent history, autodesk mode of, would say, strategic tuck-ins. think actually asset cfd simulation space announced au quarter. right approach autodesk, given point time, work done build cloud platform, data models, tuck-ins make sense? that's true, would maybe compare contrast larger-scale m&a that's happening peer space? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah. so, look, consolidation space inevitable. going comment specific deals, here's say. autodesk always acquisitive company, inquisitive company make strategic financial sense company. joe vruwink -- analyst ok. thank you. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director thank you, joe. operator thank you. next question come line elizabeth porter morgan stanley. please go ahead, elizabeth. elizabeth porter -- analyst great, thanks much question. partner getting customer running new transaction model, picked spending little bit time usual time resource existing customers. so, curious impact new business demand kind recently -- broadly, change new business trend think call versus last quarter?

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Simon Mays-Smith, VP, investor relations. Please go ahead. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Thanks, operator, and good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the third quarter results of Autodesk's fiscal '25. On the line with me is Andrew Anagnost, our CEO; and Betsy Rafael, our interim CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including outlook and related assumptions and on product and strategies. Actual events or results could differ materially. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-Q and the Form 8-K filed with today's press release for important risks and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today. If this call is replayed or reviewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Autodesk disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will quote several numeric or growth changes during this call as we discuss our financial performance. Unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison. All non-GAAP numbers referenced in today's call are reconciled in our press release or Excel financials and other supplemental materials available on our Investor Relations website. And now, I will turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Simon, and welcome, everyone, to the call. We finished the third quarter of the year strongly, delivering 12% revenue growth in constant currency and have again raised full year guidance. This reflects the sustained momentum of the business and successful execution of our strategy, including a smooth implementation of the new transaction model in Western Europe. Once again, opportunity, resilience and discipline underpinned our performance. Last month at Autodesk University in San Diego, we hosted 12,000 registered attendees and another 30,000 online. We showed how granular data in the cloud, organized the data models and connected to everything through APIs to deliver even more valuable and connected solutions for customers and partners and support a much broader ecosystem and marketplace. Customers and channel partners that I spoke with at AU remain cautiously optimistic, a sentiment consistent with the underlying momentum of our business, our growing product usage and BuildingConnected bid activity trends over recent quarters. I left AU with a tremendous sense of purpose and optimism in the ingenuity and persistence of our customers and for the future. On our earnings call last quarter, I set out our secular growth opportunities and our strategy to capitalize on them. I concluded that Autodesk's investment in cloud, platform and AI in pursuit of those opportunities were ahead of its peers. AU was a good demonstration of that. But we're also leading the industry in modernizing our go-to-market motion starting a few years ago with the subscription transition through consumption and self-service enablement and more recently to direct billing. These initiatives enable Autodesk to build larger and more durable direct relationships with its customers and to serve them more efficiently. We have already seen significant benefits from initiatives like these, and there's more to come in the next optimization phase. Taking out the effects on margins from FX and the new transaction model, we still expect to be toward the midpoint of our fiscal '26 non-GAAP operating margin target of 38% to 40% in fiscal '25, a year ahead of schedule. We're confident we will make further improvement in fiscal '26 on the same basis. The new transaction model will enable tighter channel partnerships with less duplication of effort and more digital self-service and automation, which increases customer satisfaction and workforce productivity. It will also create new opportunities for partners Autodesk to earn more with less emphasis on transaction revenue sharing and a greater emphasis on value creation for customers. Once complete, we expect the new transaction model and subsequent go-to-market optimization to increase sales and marketing efficiency and deliver GAAP margins among the best in the industry. Attractive, long-term, secular growth markets, a focused strategy delivering ever more valuable and connected solutions to our customers, and a resilient business are generating strong and sustained momentum, both in absolute terms and relative to peers. Disciplined execution and capital deployment has driven even greater operational velocity and efficiency within Autodesk and will underpin the mechanical build of revenue and free cash flow over the next few years and GAAP margins among the best in the industry. We will continue to deploy capital to offset and buy forward dilution as our free cash flow grows from the fiscal '24 trough. This practice has reduced our share count over the last three years. We have significantly increased our share repurchase authorization to extend this momentum flexibility over the medium term, with the precise trajectory remaining dependent on our debt repayment schedule and the ebb and flow of M&A. In combination, we believe these factors will deliver sustainable shareholder value over many years. Before I conclude, I'd like to formally welcome Janesh to Autodesk. We're excited to welcome Janesh, who brings a wealth of experience and will be instrumental in sustaining Autodesk's growth and enhanced profitability momentum. Of equal importance, I'd like to thank Betsy for stepping in as interim CFO at an important time in the company's journey, and I'm looking forward to continuing to work closely with her as an Autodesk Board member. I will now turn the call over to Betsy to discuss our quarterly financial performance and guidance for the year. I'll then return to provide an update on our strategic growth initiatives. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Andrew. Q3 was another strong quarter. We generated broad-based underlying growth across products and regions. In addition, we saw revenue increases from the new transaction model and M&A which were offset by the absence of enterprise business agreement true-ups from Q3 last year and FX. Our Make products continued to enhance growth, driven by our ongoing strength in construction and Fusion. Overall, macroeconomic policy and geopolitical challenges and the underlying momentum of the business were consistent with the last few quarters, with continued strong renewal rates and headwinds to our new business growth. Total revenue grew 11% and 12% in constant currency. By product, in constant currency, AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT revenue grew 8%. AEC revenue, which was most impacted by the absence of true-up revenues, grew 12%, Manufacturing revenue grew 16% and still comfortably in double digits, excluding upfront revenue. And M&E revenue grew 15% boosted by the PIX acquisition and associated integration adjustments. By region, in constant currency, revenue grew 11% in the Americas which was most impacted by the absence of true-up revenues, 13% in EMEA and 14% in APAC. The mechanical contribution from the new transaction model to revenue was $17 million in the third quarter and $25 million on a year-to-date basis. Direct revenue increased 23% and represented 42% of total revenue, up 4 percentage points from last year, benefiting from strong growth in both EBAs and the Autodesk store and also the natural tailwind to revenue from the new transaction model. Net revenue retention rate remained within the 100% to 110% range at constant exchange rates. Billings increased 28% in the quarter, reflecting a tailwind from the prior-year shift to annual billings for most multiyear contracts, early renewals and the natural tailwind from the transition to the new transaction model. Similar to last quarter, and as expected, co-terming negatively impacted billing ahead of the launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe. The natural contribution from the new transaction model to billing was $72 million in the third quarter and $108 million on a year-to-date basis. Total deferred revenue decreased 9% to $3.7 billion and was again impacted by the transition from upfront to annual billings for multiyear contracts. Total RPO of $6.1 billion and current RPO of $4.0 billion grew 17% and 14%, respectively, which reflects a tailwind from early renewals and the new transaction model and a headwind from the declining contribution of billed and unbilled deferred revenue from large, multiyear and EBA cohorts ahead of renewal in fiscal '26. Excluding these, current RPO growth was broadly consistent with Q2. We do expect the new transaction model and the larger FY '26 renewal cohorts to have a greater impact on both RPO and current RPO growth in Q4 of fiscal '25. Turning to margins. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were broadly low. With Autodesk University shifting back to Q3 this year from Q4 last year, GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins decreased by 2 and 3 percentage points, respectively. The timing effect from AU obviously washes out over the full year. At current course and speed, the ratio of stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue peaked in fiscal '24, will follow by more than a percentage point in fiscal '25 and will be below 10% over time. Free cash flow for the quarter was $199 million. This benefited from some channel partners in Western Europe booking business earlier in the quarter ahead of the transition to the new transaction model really to derisk month one after the transition. This accelerated free cash flow to the third quarter, which was partially offset by the expected negative impact of co-terming in Western Europe. Turning now to capital allocation. We continue to actively manage capital within our framework and deploy it with discipline and focus through the economic cycle to drive long-term shareholder value. As expected, the pace of buybacks picked up in the third quarter. We purchased approximately 1.2 million shares for $319 million at an average price of approximately $269 per share. We will continue to deploy capital to offset and buy forward dilution as our free cash flow grows from the fiscal '24 trough. This practice has reduced our share count by about 5 million shares over the last three years with an average percentage reduction of about 70 basis points per year. We increased the amount authorized under our share repurchase program by $5 billion for a total of approximately $9 billion. This expands our flexibility over the medium term with the precise trajectory remaining dependent on our debt repayment schedule as well as, the ebbs and flow of M&A. Now let me finish with guidance. As we said in the February, the pace of the rollout of the new transaction model will create noise in billings and the P&L. So, we think free cash flow is the best measure of our performance. Taking out that noise, the underlying momentum in the business remains consistent with the expectations embedded in our guidance range for the full year with continued strong renewal rates and headwinds to new business growth. Our sustained momentum in the third quarter and smooth launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe, reduced the likelihood of our more cautious forecast scenario. Given that, we're raising the midpoint of our billing, revenue, margin, earnings per share and free cash flow guidance ranges. So, let me give you a little bit more detail. The underlying momentum of billing is in line with our expectations. Compared to our modeling at the start of the year, the launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe in Q3 and early renewals have been a tailwind for billings, whereas more co-terming, more business done under the old buy-sell model before the launch of the new transaction model and in recent weeks, FX movement have been headwinds for billing. We now estimate that the new transaction model will provide between a 5 and 5.5 percentage point tailwind to billings growth in fiscal '25. We've raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 billings guidance by $10 million to a range of $5.90 billion to $5.98 billion. The underlying momentum of revenue is also in line with our expectations. We estimate the new transaction model will provide around 1 to 1.5 percentage point tailwind to revenue growth in fiscal '25. Upfront revenue contributed 2 percentage points to revenue growth in Q4 of fiscal '24, and therefore, this is a headwind in Q4 of fiscal '25. While not large enough to call out at the start of the year, it was already factored into our Q4 and our full year model. We've raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 revenue guidance range by $18 million to a range of $6.12 billion to $6.13 billion. We're increasing our GAAP and non-GAAP margin guidance midpoint by 25 basis points by raising the bottom end of the ranges by 50 basis points. The GAAP margin guidance range is now 21.5% to 22%. The non-GAAP margin guidance range is now 35.5% to 36%, which includes a 1 to 1.5 percentage point underlying margin improvement, broadly offset by the margin headwinds from the new transaction model and the related incremental investments in people, processes and automation. The underlying momentum of free cash flow is also in line with our expectations. The headwind to billings from co-terming and FX rates that I mentioned earlier, is being offset by early renewals, faster collections and improved underlying margins. We raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 free cash flow guidance by $10 million and tightened the range to $1.47 billion to $1.5 billion. We expect strong free cash flow growth in fiscal '26 because of the return of our largest multiyear renewal cohort the natural mechanical stacking of multiyear contracts billed annually and a larger EBA cohort. With our current trajectory, we still estimate free cash flow in fiscal '26 to be around $2.05 billion at the midpoint. The slide deck on our website has more details on modeling assumptions for Q3 and for the full fiscal year '25. And while this may be my last earnings call for Autodesk, I will stick around for a bit to ensure a smooth transition to Janesh. Thank you, Andrew, and everyone at Autodesk for your support while I was here and to the many investors and the analysts with whom I've had lively discussions over the last few quarters. While the transition to annual billings for multiyear contracts and the deployment of the new transaction model has created noise and billings in the P&L, they do provide a natural near-term tailwind to revenue and free cash flow growth. Combined with a resilient business model, sustained competitive momentum, Autodesk has enviable sources of visibility and certainty to very uncertain world. For all these reasons, I stepped down from my role as interim CFO with tremendous optimism for the future. Andrew, back to you. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Betsy. Let me finish by updating you on our strong progress in the third quarter. We continue to see good momentum in AEC, particularly in infrastructure and construction, fueled by customers consolidating onto our solutions to connect and optimize previously siloed workflows through the cloud. The cornerstone of that growing interest is our comprehensive end-to-end solutions in completing designs, preconstruction, field execution through handover and into operations. This breadth of connected capability enables us to extend our footprint further into infrastructure and construction and also expand our reach into the mid-market. As a sign of our growing momentum as the benefits of our end-to-end solution become more apparent, our construction business continue to perform robustly with net new customers doubling year over year and existing customers' renewal and expansion rates remaining strong. Let me give you a few examples. Power Construction is No. 79 on the Engineering News Record, ENR Top 400 U.S. contractor list. It is a Chicago-based general contractor serving residential and nonresidential end markets. After completing a competitive RFP to replace its legacy project management tool, Power selected Autodesk for its unified construction platform across preconstruction, construction, and DDC. By standardizing on Autodesk Construction Cloud, Power will have a single source of truth for project data, enhanced collaboration capabilities, and streamlined workflows on a single platform. Power Construction was one of two ENR 400 top 100 U.S. contractors that standardized enterprisewide on Autodesk build during the quarter. In Europe, Bouygues, a top 10 ENR 250 international contractor based in France and a leader in sustainable building and infrastructure projects renewed and expanded its EBA in the quarter. Bouygues is continuing to consolidate on Autodesk solutions across the enterprise, including broader adoption of Autodesk Forma, Carbon Insight, and Informed Design to digitize, decarbonize, and industrialize projects. It also significantly increased its commitment to Autodesk Construction Cloud to drive efficiency gains and faster bid response times through better collaboration between design and project teams. Surbana Jurong is No. 23 on ENR's top 225 international design firms. Based in Singapore, it is an urban infrastructure and integrated solutions consulting firm. In Q3, it renewed its third EBA, which included increased investment in Autodesk Construction Cloud and Autodesk Water infrastructure solutions. ACC is helping to scale its operations through increased automation, integrated design workflows and enhanced collaboration across time zones. Our water infrastructure solutions will be a core technology supporting its growth ambitions in planning, designing, engineering and managing water projects for customers worldwide. Again, these stories have a common theme. Managing people, processes and data across the project life cycle to increase efficiency and sustainability while decreasing risk. Over time, we expect the majority of all projects to be managed this way, and we remain focused on enabling that transition through our industry cloud. Moving on to manufacturing. We made excellent progress on our strategic initiatives. Customers continue to invest in their digital transformation and consolidate our Design and Make platform. Fusion remains one of the fastest-growing products in the manufacturing industry. As customers seek to drive innovation and growth at lower cost, Fusion extension attach rates are increasing, which is helping to drive the average sales price higher. For example, in the quarter, a global manufacturer supplying the semiconductor industry selected Fusion Manage and Vault PLM over competitive solutions to foster greater collaboration across manufacturing sites and improve operating efficiency. Once fully scaled and operational, this customer expects to save 105,000 hours per year by connecting people and data, resulting in reduced product development costs and faster time to market. In the U.K., Playdale Playground has been designing, manufacturing, and installing outdoor playground equipment for over 40 years. This quarter, Playdale added Fusion to its existing portfolio of Autodesk solutions, including Inventor, AutoCAD, and Vault to streamline and digitize workflows, optimize production to reduce lead times, reduce nonconformities, and replace inefficient Excel-driven operations on the shop floor. A long time Autodesk customer and global leader in precision engineering solutions renewed and expanded its EBA in the quarter. In addition to Inventor, vault and AutoCAD, it is adopting Fusion's generative design capabilities for material waste reduction and fluid flow optimization and Moldflow to reduce manufacturing costs and defects while increasing mold yields. In education, universities continue to modernize their courses and curriculum to attract and prepare future engineers. For example, from this winter, students at the University of Stuttgart, Institute for Medical Device Technology will use Fusion across six courses. Fusion was selected to replace a competitive solution for its modern platform, ease of use, cloud collaboration capabilities and unique combination of PCB and additive manufacturing workflows in a single team environment. And lastly, we continue to work with our customers to ensure they are using the latest and most secure versions of our software. For example, after a period of rapid scaling and diversification, a large multinational manufacturing company in APAC was looking to align compliance rates across its global employee base. Working collaboratively we address compliance issues while cementing a long-term partnership and completing one of our largest ever license compliance agreements, which included expanded adoption of Alias and VRED for the Design Studio and PDMC for mechanical engineering and rail design. Attractive long-term secular growth markets, a focused strategy delivering ever more valuable and connected solutions to our customers and a resilient business are generating strong and sustained momentum both in absolute terms and relative to peers. Disciplined execution and capital deployment is driving an even greater operational velocity and efficiency within Autodesk, and we continue to deploy capital to deliver sustainable shareholder value over many years. I retain a tremendous sense of purpose and optimism in the ingenuity and persistence of our customers and for the future. Operator, we would now like to open the call up for questions. Questions & Answers: Operator Thank you. [Operator instructions] Again, please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Jason Celino of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your question, please. Jason Celino -- Analyst Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Just two for me. The first one, Andrew. Some of us are unfamiliar with Janesh. Can you just tell us a little bit more about him and what he brings to Autodesk? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director I certainly can. Before I do that, let me make sure that I thank Betsy for everything she brought to Autodesk during this interim period. I really appreciate it. The company appreciates it. Thank you, Betsy. Now we're really excited about Janesh. Let me tell you why we're excited about Janesh. As you remember, one of the things I was telling you that I was looking for was someone that was going to be able to dispassionately drive optimization at scale inside of Autodesk. And what that really means is someone that's going to be really inwardly focused, looking at every dollar that we invest and making sure that we're getting the most return for the business that investors are getting the best return from their business. The next kind of criteria we were looking for, which was nice to have was, time in the seat as a sitting CFO, which was important for us as well. But it was kind of the next nice to have after the optimization at scale. Janesh brings a great balance of both of those things, right? He's been in the seat seven years at Elastic, both CFO and COO, driving some fairly turbulent changes inside of Elastic. So, he's got battle stars from pushing inside the company to get changes done inside, and we like that. We like that a lot. He's also got very good early experience at companies that we feel have always added value to Autodesk. So, he was it VMware in a senior position. He was at Cisco in a senior position. We've had good success bringing people from those kind of companies. He worked at those companies driving optimization at scale, which is the No. 1 criteria I was looking for when we we're driving this work. He also has another nice to have. He's got knowledge of our industry. He spent two years at PTC in his career. He was actually recently on the PTC board. So, he understands our industry, and he'll be able to get up to speed pretty quickly. The No. 1 goal here drive optimization and scale over the next few years, make sure that we're getting everything we need from every dollar we invest, which is a very important theme for Autodesk. And with that, I'm really excited, and I'm looking forward to him joining in December. Jason Celino -- Analyst OK. Great. Interesting. And then for my second question, now that you do have a CFO, do you have any thoughts on when you might hold the next Investor Day? I think in the past, you usually did it in March. Is that a good time frame? Or is that too soon? Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. Well, Janesh is joining in December. I think we need to give him time to get his sea legs on giving time to kind of drive the end of the year and actually get us set up for next fiscal year in good stead. So, I would say it's unlikely we'll be doing anything in the spring, but we'll get back to you on that as soon as Janesh is ready to talk about those things. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Your question, please. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst Thank you. Andrew, as of the third quarter, your three-year CAGR for current RPO is about 12%. How are you thinking about the sustainability or perhaps improvement upon that CAGR or CRPO over the next number of years? When we think about the ingredients of that, it looks like over the last several years, the CAGR for your unit volume for all brands is roughly 6% to 7% in the aggregate. So, on top of that, you've had price and other ingredients, but perhaps talk about how you think you might be able to improve upon the most recent trajectory for current RPO. Then my follow-up. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Hi, Jay, this is Betsy. Let me just give you a couple of things. There's a number of things that are going on, on the headline of the CRPO number. If you first take away the headwinds and the tailwinds was broadly consistent with the second quarter. And as I mentioned in my opening commentary, early renewals and growth with -- and the new transaction model are providing a tailwind. And then there's also a headwind to CRPO growth from the declining contribution of billed and unbilled deferred revenue risk from the large multiyear EBA cohorts coming up for renewal in fiscal '26. And just as a reminder, these are the same larger cohorts we are calling out as the tailwinds to free cash flow for next year. And if you look back to fiscal '22, we saw the same dynamic ahead of the fiscal '23 renewals as well. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst OK. Since new management is part of the news this evening, could you talk about how you're thinking about the chief revenue officer position. Would it make sense perhaps to continue to have a separate CRO? Or do you think it might make more sense perhaps to combine CRO and COO? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, we're going to continue to have a separate CRO because we have various functions that work together there under the COO organization, including our IT organization, our infrastructure and all things associated. What we're looking for in our CRO is someone that understands how to continue to drive a business when you have direct engagement with the customer. So, that means someone that really understands what it takes to analyze self-service patterns, actually understand the data that comes in from the customers to help drive cross-sell and upsell while also transforming a channel from a transactionally focused extension of Autodesk to kind of a solution partner that's driving life cycle solutions for our customers. So, that's the kind of role we're looking for here. And yes, it's going to continue to be a stand-alone CRO role within the COO organization. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Borg of Stifel. Your line is open. Adam Borg -- Analyst Awesome. Thanks so much for taking the questions, and congrats to Betsy and Janesh. Maybe on the new transaction model. I know it's still early. But I was just curious, are there any learnings from those customers that are on the new model that you're seeing in terms of the adoption of Autodesk technology and the ability to find white space to better upsell and cross-sell different solutions now that you have a more direct relationship. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah, Adam, it's really early on to be able to make any kind of conclusions about that. What I can tell you is that we definitely see some shifts to some of the direct channels at Autodesk for customers that were probably just served on a very kind of arm's length kind of transactional level. But in terms of driving cross-sell and upsell, early days, early days. But if you want to get a sense for how that might evolve, we've got experience with our EBAs and our enterprise business agreements. And we've learned over the years that having that kind of relationship with the customer where we really understand their usage patterns, who they are and what they're doing, we are much more effective at driving cross-sell and upsell even when partnering with our channel partners. So, I think those kind of stand as a testament of what's possible as we move forward with completion of the new transaction model. Adam Borg -- Analyst Great. And maybe just as a quick follow-up. Just as we think about the new administration coming in, you talked about the macro being broadly consistent. Any change in tone in your conversations with the end markets in terms of optimism or their ability or willingness to expand new projects ahead of the administration? Any pause or just full steam ahead? I'm just curious, any commentary you have there from a macro perspective would be really, really helpful. Thanks so much. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director What I'll say is the things that matter to our customers are bipartisan things, all right? Our customers care about infrastructure builds out. Both parties care about infrastructure build-outs. Our customers care about domestic manufacturing in Europe, be it in the United States, both parties agree that the domestic manufacturing build-outs are important. Supply chain, independent, supply chain stability. All of these things are bipartisan issues that really affect our customers. So, regardless of the administration, I suspect the things that are important to our customers are continuing to be a focus. Adam Borg -- Analyst Thanks, again. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink of Baird. Please go ahead, Joe. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst Thank you. On the outlook for next year, $2.050 billion in free cash has, I think, been the expectation for the past year now. Within the last year, you've also seen more co-term of contracts. And I think that leads to better billings in FY '26. So, my question is, does that actually create the potential that things are better, and that's why you're qualifying now the $2.050 billion as the midpoint of possibilities. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer There's no change to how we've talked about the free cash flow guide for fiscal '26, it continues to be $2.05 billion at the mid-point. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst OK. Fair enough. And then just on the M&A environment, over recent history, Autodesk has been more in a mode of, I would say, strategic tuck-ins. I think there is actually an asset in the CFD simulation space that was announced during AU in the quarter. Is that the right approach for Autodesk, just given this point in time, all the work you've done to build out the cloud platform, the data models, and so these tuck-ins make the most sense? And if that's true, how would you maybe compare and contrast some of the larger-scale M&A that's happening with your peers in the space? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, look, consolidation in our space is inevitable. I'm not going to comment on any specific deals, but here's what I'll say. Autodesk has always been an acquisitive company, and we will be an inquisitive company when that makes both strategic and financial sense for the company. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst OK. Thank you. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Joe. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Porter of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Elizabeth. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great, thanks so much for the question. As partners are getting customers just up and running on the new transaction model, we picked up that they're spending a little bit more time than usual of time and resources with those existing customers. So, I was curious if that had any impact on new business demand kind of more recently -- and then just more broadly, any change in new business trends that you think you should call out from versus last quarter? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Elizabeth, it's Betsy. And so, just broadly speaking, we continue to see growth, but at a slower pace due to a number of factors really over the last several years, macro, COVID, exiting Russia, elections, and while a drag on the forward momentum of the business, all of that really factored into our guidance. So, I kind of just will leave it at that. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great. And then a follow-up just on billings. I understand there's a lot of volatility around the change from multiyear in the transaction model. But it looks like guidance implies a bigger step down in growth in Q4, just despite easier year-ago compare. So, hoping that you could help us unpack the balance of those headwinds and tailwinds that would drive kind of a greater downtick in growth in Q4. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, again, let me start out with just from a fiscal '25 perspective. Your billing tailwinds are going to be from the final shift to annual billings, new transaction model and early renewals. And you're going to get headwinds from co-terming and business booked ahead of the new transaction model launch and in recent weeks, some FX. So, again, I think that we've continued to perform well as we've executed through through Q3. And so, I think we feel very, very strongly about our expectations for Q4. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bhavin Shah of Deutsche Bank. Your question please, Bhavin. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Great, thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the quarter. Andrew, at university, there appeared to be a noticeable uptick in attendance and sessions geared toward owners and operators. What been driving the recent interest from the segment? How much of it is product enhancements you guys have made versus really more focusing and emphasizing from a go-to-market perspective? And how long before this segment of buyers kind of becomes more meaningful to the financials? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah, Bhavin, that's an excellent question, right. We're very interested in tackling the whole entire life cycle from design, through make, construction, manufacturing, all the way into operations. You're probably aware we have a product called Tandem. And a lot of those sessions were driven by increasing interest and increasing adoption of Tandem, which is a digital twin solution, tightly coupled to our solutions that also has a toolkit that allows people to easily connect sensor data through the digital twin solution. So, you're seeing that uptick because we're directly releasing products and capabilities that are of interest to the owner space. You can expect to see that trend continue over time, and you can expect to see us continue to talk about the owner space, continue to deliver solutions for the owner space and even APIs for the owner space. It's an area of great interest, especially when it comes not only to vertical buildings, but factories and other things that are related to that as well as, infrastructure like what we were doing with some of our water owner solutions. So, yes, owners matter. We're building software for them, and you're going to see more of that. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Super helpful there. And then, Betsy, one for you. Just in terms of the underlying improvement that we've been seeing in the margins, and I know you've called out FX and the transaction model. I know it's very early, but as you think about next year, how do we think about like the impact of FX and the transaction model to kind of the headline operating margins? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, I wish I could give you that answer, but I think that the new CFO would probably have a little bit of a problem with that. So, we'll wait till the end of February to give you more specifics on that. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Fair enough. Thanks for taking may questions. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Good try. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke of Citi. Please go ahead, Tyler. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Yeah, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I was going to ask you about a placeholder for next year's guidance, Betsy. don't want to waste a question on that, but feel free to answer. But Andrew, I wanted to kind of ask you about some of your comments you made around efficiency, especially as it relates to hiring Janesh, who you pointed out has a lot of experience at larger companies, VMware, Cisco, et cetera. Now that you're a few quarters into this transaction model rollout, you have kind of visibility better on some of the channel prior channel relationships, having that direct billing with the customer. What are some of the areas that you've identified as having that efficiency potential? And then as we think about that efficiency unlock, should we think about that as incremental to the free cash flow number you have out for next year? Or is that embedded in that already. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director So, many layers to that question. All right. First, let me kind of answer the question in a series of stages then dodge other ones, OK? So, first off, optimization is kind of a mindset at Autodesk. It's not something that that suddenly happens. I want to reemphasize that because if you look right now, this year, for example, when you look at the apples-to-apples comparison, which will be in the slide decks, are in our disclosed materials you can see that our non-GAAP margins are already hitting the targets we set for next year this year, OK? So, optimization is a mentality. You've also heard me say over and over again as the new transaction model starts to roll out, optimization of our go-to-market efforts is going to be a critical step for us and part of the optimization journey that we're on, that's going to deliver margin growth for the company for couple of years to come, OK? And I think that's important. It's a long-term driver. Now with getting into the specifics, OK? I think the specifics are probably for another time, but let me just kind of give you a sense for some of the things that are important, right? One is the drive to self-service, right? Self-service is a huge impact on how our customers will engage with us and where those customers come from, and that is value accretive to Autodesk, both on an efficiency side, from renewals and other things, but also on the revenue growth side through capturing the customers directly. The other thing I talked about is understanding the customer better, so the upsell and cross-sell. So, we're going to be able to do a lot more automation and understanding about where the opportunities are, and that's going to drive some efficiencies. And we're moving the channel partners away from this model of being the transactional players to being the solution providers and the IP providers to our customers. That's going to have all sorts of opportunities to eliminate duplication of effort and drive real cost efficiencies for the company moving forward. There's both top-line efficiencies here in revenue growth, but there's bottom line efficiencies as well through removing the redundancies and steps that just aren't necessary for the customer. You'll get a lot more clarity on that as you see us continue to move forward with this go-to-market optimization in the next year and beyond that. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Great. And then my follow-up question, Andrew, you talked about some really strong net new customer additions within the Construction Cloud, I think, doubling year over year. we also saw the Make revenue accelerate to 28% constant currency. Can you just help us understand, do you think that reacceleration is durable? And how are you sort of thinking about just your position there? What's been driving that strength in the new customer additions? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director First, let me comment on the make revenues, then I'm going to go into construction. So, the make revenue also includes some revenue from PIX and things associated with that. However, let's talk about the facts around our construction business because I think this is important, right? No. 1 factor is that we continue to drive consistent, high growth in our construction solutions. You're seeing it. It's built into the Make numbers, and it's the lion's share of those Make numbers. You're really seeing some consistent growth there. That's organically. Inorganically, we're actually executing incredibly well on things like Payapps, and that's driving acceleration of our growth. So, we are not decelerating as a business, OK? We are actually performing solidly inorganically, we're accelerating, all right? And I just want to be really clear about that. And yes, we said year over year, we drove a 2x increase in our new customers. And I'll talk about where some of that's coming from in just a minute. But I also want to highlight the other thing that's going on we are strengthening an already strong position in the ENR 400. So, you heard about the story about power construction, which was a great example of someone taking out a competitive RFP and say, look, I need a forward-looking cloud-based solution on new technology that goes end to end from design to construction all the way to operations. And they chose us. And that was just one example that we gave in the opening commentary. So, already a strengthening position in the ENR 400. Now the other qualitative things that are driving some of that new customer growth is we already have our distribution channel operating at scale. In the U.S., this is helping us go down market more effectively, which is allowing us to capture more customers more effectively be places where we weren't before and where others aren't, which is part of driving that. But also, we're already at scale operating internationally with our distribution channel. So, that's driving international growth for us. And that's a really important driver as well as, some of those net new accounts that you're seeing there. And the last thing I'll add that I'm done with construction is that, look, I heard this over and over again at AU, I'm hearing it over and over again from customers in lots of different places. They want the end-to-end solution. They want the licensed version in the cloud, they're placing bets for the next 10 years. They want to go from design to construction to operations, and that's just making our solution more attractive to the market. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo. Your question, please. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Hey, thanks very much. I appreciate you taking the questions. A commentary on the call sounded consistent, but wondering if there are any added details you can provide for us on just the overall macro spend environment and how that's maybe progressing across either key product segments or geos, whatever split you think is more useful. I think what we're trying to get a sense for is if there are any shades of improvement anywhere or if you'd characterize as mainly just consistent over the past couple of quarters. Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Michael, I think the core answer here is consistency, OK? We're seeing consistent trends that we've seen with -- in all the other quarters. There's always puts and takes in a large business like ours, especially ones as divers as ours. But the general tone is consistent with prior quarters. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer And I would just add that there's also been a lot of noise this year from the new transaction model and then obviously, the elections and leading up to that. And so, it's hard to sparse out kind of that particular behavior. So, I think as Andrew said, we call it consistent. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Yeah, tough for us, too. That's why we keep asking. Betsy, congrats on the transition back given you're also on the board. I think it'd be useful to hear you chime in on the hiring of Janesh and maybe just also comment on how you ensure you're able to hand over the reins and keep progress going on the key transitions the company is working through. Thanks. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Per se, I was involved in the process, which was quite extensive in the company and the recruiting of Janesh. And so, we're certainly very excited to have him on board. What I would also say is, obviously, with my experience of being on the board for 11 years as well as, my deep dive into the business over the last six months. One of the reasons I'm staying around until the end of the fiscal year, is I think I could be really helpful in that transition for Janesh. And so, I'm very much looking forward to it. And I think that we have a great finance team, and I think that he's going to fit very well, and I'm looking forward to making that happen as fast as we can. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. Your question, please, Matthew. Mike Richards -- Analyst Hey, guys. This is Mike Richards on for Matt. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could provide an update on Project Bernini and maybe how customer reception has been and where we are in developing other foundational models or just the monetization opportunity there? Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, first off, before I comment on Bernini, as you might have heard from AU, AI is embedded in everything we're doing from a bottom-up and a top-down perspective. And you also heard us talk at AU about new types of foundation models we're building that understand how certain things are done in our applications. You heard about a foundation model that's driving automated drawing creation. You heard about a foundation model that's driving automated sketch generation and sketch constraints. That kind of stuff is bottom-up innovation. Bernini more of a top-down type innovation where you're actually specifying things and trying to generate a preliminary outcome from those specifications. And what we've been doing with Bernini is we've been trying to engage with certain targeted customers to get them to participate with us in making Bernini smarter and more intelligent. It's not available commercially right now. but it's getting more intelligent. We've actually been successful in getting some customers to stand up and say, look, yes, I'd like to work with you to make this more intelligent because we need something that actually understands 3D geometry as geometry, not just in the picture or something, OK? So, that's what's going on with Bernini right now, and you should continue to see refinements and extensions of that moving forward. Now with regard to monetization, monetization, nobody knows exactly how all this is going to be monetized. But there's a few vectors here that that come into play. One, we are ahead of our competitors in this space. We intend to be ahead. We're investing to stay ahead. That increase ones competitive position in the marketplace, and that's really important. Also, you get to be able to charge for some of these incremental features in the future. When you're delivering value or a high-quality outcome as a result, you're going to charge for that outcome. How we charge for those things? Let's just play out, OK? It's still early days. But there's also monetization opportunities through licensing certain technologies for specific mature maturation for specific customers' needs, all right? And that will be another avenue. So, how these avenues play out, which one waits more, let this play out. But what you need to know about Autodesk is we're ahead. We've been ahead for a while. We were the first out there with an AI research lab that been out there for over six years. It's published 70 papers. We're right on the cutting edge of 3D design technology in AI, and we intend to stay there. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of J.P. Morgan. Your question please, Steve. Stephen Tusa -- Analyst Good evening or afternoon. Lots of good questions asked. Just a detailed one. What's the change in the billings contribution from the transaction model change? The five to six to five to five and a half. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Yeah. So, it's basically because we did more buy/sell business ahead of the European launch. It's short answer. So, remember, we said 5% to 6% when we launched Europe. And it was the -- we did more buy sell business, which means there's less tailwind from the new transaction model. The flip side of -- that means that the underlying increase in our billings guidance is greater than it looks on a headline basis. Stephen Tusa -- Analyst OK, great. Thanks a lot. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Tilton of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Hey, guys, can you hear me? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Great. I have a kind of a high-level one on the incoming CFO. If I heard correctly, we didn't exactly get like an initial outlook for revenue growth for next year. And I'm just trying to understand in the context of the new CFO coming in, is there anything that could change the calculus of how you guys think about that 10% to 15% growth for the underlying business outside of the agency transition that's ongoing today. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Well, first, let's talk about that framework a little bit, and then I'll comment a little bit on the incoming CFO. So, look, the 10% to 15% growth. Right now, we're pretty much right at the bottom end of that range. And if we look back over the last two years, there's been a series of things that created headwinds to new business. It started off with things like the pandemic, the inflation, the exiting of the Russian business, the writer's strike, the whole trade wars within particular geographies. All of these things were accumulated headwinds that build slowly into the business and have pushed us down to the low end of the range. it takes time in a subscription model for those things to build out of the business, OK? So, it's going to take time for us to build out of that. That's to be expected with a subscription model. The revenue goes down slowly. It goes back up slowly as headwinds turn into tailwinds. So, expect us to be near the bottom of that range in the short term just as a general kind of guideline for the core business to be at the bottom of the range, OK? As a long-term framework, the 10% to 15% still makes sense as a long-term guide for the company. But of course, as new eyes come in, we'll look at these things, and we'll evaluate them. But right now, this all still makes sense. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Super helpful. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho. Your question, please. Siti Panigrahi -- Analyst Thanks for taking my question. I understand the new business model of some kind of noise in your expense and margin side. But if you exclude that, where do you see some of the operating leverage that you can drive in next year or so? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, I think we've actually provided kind of historically what we've done over the last three years pretty clearly. And I think we said that we continue to be focused on expansion, but nothing further to add as far as next year. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director We did provide data on that. So, you can see what underlying thing is, and we expect to see continued improvement in that same vector. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations On the same basis. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director On the same basis, on the same apples-to-apples basis. Siti Panigrahi -- Analyst OK, great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Funk of Bank of America. Your question, please. Michael Funk -- Analyst Yeah. Guys, thank you for the question tonight. Two, if I could. You've mentioned a few times in the last calls about the largest multiyear cohort renewing next year and then also a large EBA cohort. Just wondering if you can give us kind of the range of potential outcomes among the renewals there, whether a potential to upsell, risk of down sell and what that variance might look like around those renewals? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer No. I mean I think what we have said is that it's the largest cohort and we saw that performance in '23. And so, we expect a strong renewal year, but we're not giving any specific guidance on what that looks like for '26 at this point, and we'll wait until we report earnings in February. Michael Funk -- Analyst OK. Great. And then, Betsy, one more. You've mentioned a few times after the investment in new transaction model, people processes, and automation, presumably more fixed cost versus variable like commission. Can you quantify that for us to help us with modeling as we try to forecast margin? I know you've not given guidance, but better understanding of what that cost might actually be on an absolute basis would help us to think about our modeling. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Mike, we've got a slide in the earnings deck to help you think about modeling. And I'll just point you to that. Michael Funk -- Analyst OK, great. Thank you, Simon. Operator Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for Q&A today. I would now like to turn the conference back to Simon Mays-Smith for closing remarks. Sir? Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Great.

so, that's what's going bernini right now, continue see refinement extension moving forward. regard monetization, monetization, nobody know exactly going monetized. there's vector come play. one, ahead competitor space. intend ahead. investing stay ahead. increase one competitive position marketplace, that's really important. also, get able charge incremental feature future. delivering value high-quality outcome result, going charge outcome. charge things? let's play out, ok? still early days. there's also monetization opportunity licensing certain technology specific mature maturation specific customers' needs, right? another avenue. so, avenue play out, one wait more, let play out. need know autodesk ahead. ahead while. first ai research lab six years. published 70 papers. right cutting edge 3d design technology ai, intend stay there. operator thank you. next question come line steve tusa j.p. morgan. question please, steve. stephen tusa -- analyst good evening afternoon. lot good question asked. detailed one. what's change billing contribution transaction model change? five six five five half. simon mays-smith -- vice president, investor relation yeah. so, basically buy/sell business ahead european launch. short answer. so, remember, said 5% 6% launched europe. -- buy sell business, mean there's less tailwind new transaction model. flip side -- mean underlying increase billing guidance greater look headline basis. stephen tusa -- analyst ok, great. thanks lot. operator thank you. next question come line joshua tilton wolfe research. line open. joshua tilton -- analyst hey, guys, hear me? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah. joshua tilton -- analyst great. kind high-level one incoming cfo. heard correctly, exactly get like initial outlook revenue growth next year. trying understand context new cfo coming in, anything could change calculus guy think 10% 15% growth underlying business outside agency transition that's ongoing today. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director well, first, let's talk framework little bit, comment little bit incoming cfo. so, look, 10% 15% growth. right now, pretty much right bottom end range. look back last two years, there's series thing created headwind new business. started thing like pandemic, inflation, exiting russian business, writer's strike, whole trade war within particular geographies. thing accumulated headwind build slowly business pushed u low end range. take time subscription model thing build business, ok?

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Simon Mays-Smith, VP, investor relations. Please go ahead. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Thanks, operator, and good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the third quarter results of Autodesk's fiscal '25. On the line with me is Andrew Anagnost, our CEO; and Betsy Rafael, our interim CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including outlook and related assumptions and on product and strategies. Actual events or results could differ materially. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-Q and the Form 8-K filed with today's press release for important risks and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today. If this call is replayed or reviewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Autodesk disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will quote several numeric or growth changes during this call as we discuss our financial performance. Unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison. All non-GAAP numbers referenced in today's call are reconciled in our press release or Excel financials and other supplemental materials available on our Investor Relations website. And now, I will turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Simon, and welcome, everyone, to the call. We finished the third quarter of the year strongly, delivering 12% revenue growth in constant currency and have again raised full year guidance. This reflects the sustained momentum of the business and successful execution of our strategy, including a smooth implementation of the new transaction model in Western Europe. Once again, opportunity, resilience and discipline underpinned our performance. Last month at Autodesk University in San Diego, we hosted 12,000 registered attendees and another 30,000 online. We showed how granular data in the cloud, organized the data models and connected to everything through APIs to deliver even more valuable and connected solutions for customers and partners and support a much broader ecosystem and marketplace. Customers and channel partners that I spoke with at AU remain cautiously optimistic, a sentiment consistent with the underlying momentum of our business, our growing product usage and BuildingConnected bid activity trends over recent quarters. I left AU with a tremendous sense of purpose and optimism in the ingenuity and persistence of our customers and for the future. On our earnings call last quarter, I set out our secular growth opportunities and our strategy to capitalize on them. I concluded that Autodesk's investment in cloud, platform and AI in pursuit of those opportunities were ahead of its peers. AU was a good demonstration of that. But we're also leading the industry in modernizing our go-to-market motion starting a few years ago with the subscription transition through consumption and self-service enablement and more recently to direct billing. These initiatives enable Autodesk to build larger and more durable direct relationships with its customers and to serve them more efficiently. We have already seen significant benefits from initiatives like these, and there's more to come in the next optimization phase. Taking out the effects on margins from FX and the new transaction model, we still expect to be toward the midpoint of our fiscal '26 non-GAAP operating margin target of 38% to 40% in fiscal '25, a year ahead of schedule. We're confident we will make further improvement in fiscal '26 on the same basis. The new transaction model will enable tighter channel partnerships with less duplication of effort and more digital self-service and automation, which increases customer satisfaction and workforce productivity. It will also create new opportunities for partners Autodesk to earn more with less emphasis on transaction revenue sharing and a greater emphasis on value creation for customers. Once complete, we expect the new transaction model and subsequent go-to-market optimization to increase sales and marketing efficiency and deliver GAAP margins among the best in the industry. Attractive, long-term, secular growth markets, a focused strategy delivering ever more valuable and connected solutions to our customers, and a resilient business are generating strong and sustained momentum, both in absolute terms and relative to peers. Disciplined execution and capital deployment has driven even greater operational velocity and efficiency within Autodesk and will underpin the mechanical build of revenue and free cash flow over the next few years and GAAP margins among the best in the industry. We will continue to deploy capital to offset and buy forward dilution as our free cash flow grows from the fiscal '24 trough. This practice has reduced our share count over the last three years. We have significantly increased our share repurchase authorization to extend this momentum flexibility over the medium term, with the precise trajectory remaining dependent on our debt repayment schedule and the ebb and flow of M&A. In combination, we believe these factors will deliver sustainable shareholder value over many years. Before I conclude, I'd like to formally welcome Janesh to Autodesk. We're excited to welcome Janesh, who brings a wealth of experience and will be instrumental in sustaining Autodesk's growth and enhanced profitability momentum. Of equal importance, I'd like to thank Betsy for stepping in as interim CFO at an important time in the company's journey, and I'm looking forward to continuing to work closely with her as an Autodesk Board member. I will now turn the call over to Betsy to discuss our quarterly financial performance and guidance for the year. I'll then return to provide an update on our strategic growth initiatives. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Andrew. Q3 was another strong quarter. We generated broad-based underlying growth across products and regions. In addition, we saw revenue increases from the new transaction model and M&A which were offset by the absence of enterprise business agreement true-ups from Q3 last year and FX. Our Make products continued to enhance growth, driven by our ongoing strength in construction and Fusion. Overall, macroeconomic policy and geopolitical challenges and the underlying momentum of the business were consistent with the last few quarters, with continued strong renewal rates and headwinds to our new business growth. Total revenue grew 11% and 12% in constant currency. By product, in constant currency, AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT revenue grew 8%. AEC revenue, which was most impacted by the absence of true-up revenues, grew 12%, Manufacturing revenue grew 16% and still comfortably in double digits, excluding upfront revenue. And M&E revenue grew 15% boosted by the PIX acquisition and associated integration adjustments. By region, in constant currency, revenue grew 11% in the Americas which was most impacted by the absence of true-up revenues, 13% in EMEA and 14% in APAC. The mechanical contribution from the new transaction model to revenue was $17 million in the third quarter and $25 million on a year-to-date basis. Direct revenue increased 23% and represented 42% of total revenue, up 4 percentage points from last year, benefiting from strong growth in both EBAs and the Autodesk store and also the natural tailwind to revenue from the new transaction model. Net revenue retention rate remained within the 100% to 110% range at constant exchange rates. Billings increased 28% in the quarter, reflecting a tailwind from the prior-year shift to annual billings for most multiyear contracts, early renewals and the natural tailwind from the transition to the new transaction model. Similar to last quarter, and as expected, co-terming negatively impacted billing ahead of the launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe. The natural contribution from the new transaction model to billing was $72 million in the third quarter and $108 million on a year-to-date basis. Total deferred revenue decreased 9% to $3.7 billion and was again impacted by the transition from upfront to annual billings for multiyear contracts. Total RPO of $6.1 billion and current RPO of $4.0 billion grew 17% and 14%, respectively, which reflects a tailwind from early renewals and the new transaction model and a headwind from the declining contribution of billed and unbilled deferred revenue from large, multiyear and EBA cohorts ahead of renewal in fiscal '26. Excluding these, current RPO growth was broadly consistent with Q2. We do expect the new transaction model and the larger FY '26 renewal cohorts to have a greater impact on both RPO and current RPO growth in Q4 of fiscal '25. Turning to margins. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were broadly low. With Autodesk University shifting back to Q3 this year from Q4 last year, GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins decreased by 2 and 3 percentage points, respectively. The timing effect from AU obviously washes out over the full year. At current course and speed, the ratio of stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue peaked in fiscal '24, will follow by more than a percentage point in fiscal '25 and will be below 10% over time. Free cash flow for the quarter was $199 million. This benefited from some channel partners in Western Europe booking business earlier in the quarter ahead of the transition to the new transaction model really to derisk month one after the transition. This accelerated free cash flow to the third quarter, which was partially offset by the expected negative impact of co-terming in Western Europe. Turning now to capital allocation. We continue to actively manage capital within our framework and deploy it with discipline and focus through the economic cycle to drive long-term shareholder value. As expected, the pace of buybacks picked up in the third quarter. We purchased approximately 1.2 million shares for $319 million at an average price of approximately $269 per share. We will continue to deploy capital to offset and buy forward dilution as our free cash flow grows from the fiscal '24 trough. This practice has reduced our share count by about 5 million shares over the last three years with an average percentage reduction of about 70 basis points per year. We increased the amount authorized under our share repurchase program by $5 billion for a total of approximately $9 billion. This expands our flexibility over the medium term with the precise trajectory remaining dependent on our debt repayment schedule as well as, the ebbs and flow of M&A. Now let me finish with guidance. As we said in the February, the pace of the rollout of the new transaction model will create noise in billings and the P&L. So, we think free cash flow is the best measure of our performance. Taking out that noise, the underlying momentum in the business remains consistent with the expectations embedded in our guidance range for the full year with continued strong renewal rates and headwinds to new business growth. Our sustained momentum in the third quarter and smooth launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe, reduced the likelihood of our more cautious forecast scenario. Given that, we're raising the midpoint of our billing, revenue, margin, earnings per share and free cash flow guidance ranges. So, let me give you a little bit more detail. The underlying momentum of billing is in line with our expectations. Compared to our modeling at the start of the year, the launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe in Q3 and early renewals have been a tailwind for billings, whereas more co-terming, more business done under the old buy-sell model before the launch of the new transaction model and in recent weeks, FX movement have been headwinds for billing. We now estimate that the new transaction model will provide between a 5 and 5.5 percentage point tailwind to billings growth in fiscal '25. We've raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 billings guidance by $10 million to a range of $5.90 billion to $5.98 billion. The underlying momentum of revenue is also in line with our expectations. We estimate the new transaction model will provide around 1 to 1.5 percentage point tailwind to revenue growth in fiscal '25. Upfront revenue contributed 2 percentage points to revenue growth in Q4 of fiscal '24, and therefore, this is a headwind in Q4 of fiscal '25. While not large enough to call out at the start of the year, it was already factored into our Q4 and our full year model. We've raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 revenue guidance range by $18 million to a range of $6.12 billion to $6.13 billion. We're increasing our GAAP and non-GAAP margin guidance midpoint by 25 basis points by raising the bottom end of the ranges by 50 basis points. The GAAP margin guidance range is now 21.5% to 22%. The non-GAAP margin guidance range is now 35.5% to 36%, which includes a 1 to 1.5 percentage point underlying margin improvement, broadly offset by the margin headwinds from the new transaction model and the related incremental investments in people, processes and automation. The underlying momentum of free cash flow is also in line with our expectations. The headwind to billings from co-terming and FX rates that I mentioned earlier, is being offset by early renewals, faster collections and improved underlying margins. We raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 free cash flow guidance by $10 million and tightened the range to $1.47 billion to $1.5 billion. We expect strong free cash flow growth in fiscal '26 because of the return of our largest multiyear renewal cohort the natural mechanical stacking of multiyear contracts billed annually and a larger EBA cohort. With our current trajectory, we still estimate free cash flow in fiscal '26 to be around $2.05 billion at the midpoint. The slide deck on our website has more details on modeling assumptions for Q3 and for the full fiscal year '25. And while this may be my last earnings call for Autodesk, I will stick around for a bit to ensure a smooth transition to Janesh. Thank you, Andrew, and everyone at Autodesk for your support while I was here and to the many investors and the analysts with whom I've had lively discussions over the last few quarters. While the transition to annual billings for multiyear contracts and the deployment of the new transaction model has created noise and billings in the P&L, they do provide a natural near-term tailwind to revenue and free cash flow growth. Combined with a resilient business model, sustained competitive momentum, Autodesk has enviable sources of visibility and certainty to very uncertain world. For all these reasons, I stepped down from my role as interim CFO with tremendous optimism for the future. Andrew, back to you. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Betsy. Let me finish by updating you on our strong progress in the third quarter. We continue to see good momentum in AEC, particularly in infrastructure and construction, fueled by customers consolidating onto our solutions to connect and optimize previously siloed workflows through the cloud. The cornerstone of that growing interest is our comprehensive end-to-end solutions in completing designs, preconstruction, field execution through handover and into operations. This breadth of connected capability enables us to extend our footprint further into infrastructure and construction and also expand our reach into the mid-market. As a sign of our growing momentum as the benefits of our end-to-end solution become more apparent, our construction business continue to perform robustly with net new customers doubling year over year and existing customers' renewal and expansion rates remaining strong. Let me give you a few examples. Power Construction is No. 79 on the Engineering News Record, ENR Top 400 U.S. contractor list. It is a Chicago-based general contractor serving residential and nonresidential end markets. After completing a competitive RFP to replace its legacy project management tool, Power selected Autodesk for its unified construction platform across preconstruction, construction, and DDC. By standardizing on Autodesk Construction Cloud, Power will have a single source of truth for project data, enhanced collaboration capabilities, and streamlined workflows on a single platform. Power Construction was one of two ENR 400 top 100 U.S. contractors that standardized enterprisewide on Autodesk build during the quarter. In Europe, Bouygues, a top 10 ENR 250 international contractor based in France and a leader in sustainable building and infrastructure projects renewed and expanded its EBA in the quarter. Bouygues is continuing to consolidate on Autodesk solutions across the enterprise, including broader adoption of Autodesk Forma, Carbon Insight, and Informed Design to digitize, decarbonize, and industrialize projects. It also significantly increased its commitment to Autodesk Construction Cloud to drive efficiency gains and faster bid response times through better collaboration between design and project teams. Surbana Jurong is No. 23 on ENR's top 225 international design firms. Based in Singapore, it is an urban infrastructure and integrated solutions consulting firm. In Q3, it renewed its third EBA, which included increased investment in Autodesk Construction Cloud and Autodesk Water infrastructure solutions. ACC is helping to scale its operations through increased automation, integrated design workflows and enhanced collaboration across time zones. Our water infrastructure solutions will be a core technology supporting its growth ambitions in planning, designing, engineering and managing water projects for customers worldwide. Again, these stories have a common theme. Managing people, processes and data across the project life cycle to increase efficiency and sustainability while decreasing risk. Over time, we expect the majority of all projects to be managed this way, and we remain focused on enabling that transition through our industry cloud. Moving on to manufacturing. We made excellent progress on our strategic initiatives. Customers continue to invest in their digital transformation and consolidate our Design and Make platform. Fusion remains one of the fastest-growing products in the manufacturing industry. As customers seek to drive innovation and growth at lower cost, Fusion extension attach rates are increasing, which is helping to drive the average sales price higher. For example, in the quarter, a global manufacturer supplying the semiconductor industry selected Fusion Manage and Vault PLM over competitive solutions to foster greater collaboration across manufacturing sites and improve operating efficiency. Once fully scaled and operational, this customer expects to save 105,000 hours per year by connecting people and data, resulting in reduced product development costs and faster time to market. In the U.K., Playdale Playground has been designing, manufacturing, and installing outdoor playground equipment for over 40 years. This quarter, Playdale added Fusion to its existing portfolio of Autodesk solutions, including Inventor, AutoCAD, and Vault to streamline and digitize workflows, optimize production to reduce lead times, reduce nonconformities, and replace inefficient Excel-driven operations on the shop floor. A long time Autodesk customer and global leader in precision engineering solutions renewed and expanded its EBA in the quarter. In addition to Inventor, vault and AutoCAD, it is adopting Fusion's generative design capabilities for material waste reduction and fluid flow optimization and Moldflow to reduce manufacturing costs and defects while increasing mold yields. In education, universities continue to modernize their courses and curriculum to attract and prepare future engineers. For example, from this winter, students at the University of Stuttgart, Institute for Medical Device Technology will use Fusion across six courses. Fusion was selected to replace a competitive solution for its modern platform, ease of use, cloud collaboration capabilities and unique combination of PCB and additive manufacturing workflows in a single team environment. And lastly, we continue to work with our customers to ensure they are using the latest and most secure versions of our software. For example, after a period of rapid scaling and diversification, a large multinational manufacturing company in APAC was looking to align compliance rates across its global employee base. Working collaboratively we address compliance issues while cementing a long-term partnership and completing one of our largest ever license compliance agreements, which included expanded adoption of Alias and VRED for the Design Studio and PDMC for mechanical engineering and rail design. Attractive long-term secular growth markets, a focused strategy delivering ever more valuable and connected solutions to our customers and a resilient business are generating strong and sustained momentum both in absolute terms and relative to peers. Disciplined execution and capital deployment is driving an even greater operational velocity and efficiency within Autodesk, and we continue to deploy capital to deliver sustainable shareholder value over many years. I retain a tremendous sense of purpose and optimism in the ingenuity and persistence of our customers and for the future. Operator, we would now like to open the call up for questions. Questions & Answers: Operator Thank you. [Operator instructions] Again, please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Jason Celino of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your question, please. Jason Celino -- Analyst Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Just two for me. The first one, Andrew. Some of us are unfamiliar with Janesh. Can you just tell us a little bit more about him and what he brings to Autodesk? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director I certainly can. Before I do that, let me make sure that I thank Betsy for everything she brought to Autodesk during this interim period. I really appreciate it. The company appreciates it. Thank you, Betsy. Now we're really excited about Janesh. Let me tell you why we're excited about Janesh. As you remember, one of the things I was telling you that I was looking for was someone that was going to be able to dispassionately drive optimization at scale inside of Autodesk. And what that really means is someone that's going to be really inwardly focused, looking at every dollar that we invest and making sure that we're getting the most return for the business that investors are getting the best return from their business. The next kind of criteria we were looking for, which was nice to have was, time in the seat as a sitting CFO, which was important for us as well. But it was kind of the next nice to have after the optimization at scale. Janesh brings a great balance of both of those things, right? He's been in the seat seven years at Elastic, both CFO and COO, driving some fairly turbulent changes inside of Elastic. So, he's got battle stars from pushing inside the company to get changes done inside, and we like that. We like that a lot. He's also got very good early experience at companies that we feel have always added value to Autodesk. So, he was it VMware in a senior position. He was at Cisco in a senior position. We've had good success bringing people from those kind of companies. He worked at those companies driving optimization at scale, which is the No. 1 criteria I was looking for when we we're driving this work. He also has another nice to have. He's got knowledge of our industry. He spent two years at PTC in his career. He was actually recently on the PTC board. So, he understands our industry, and he'll be able to get up to speed pretty quickly. The No. 1 goal here drive optimization and scale over the next few years, make sure that we're getting everything we need from every dollar we invest, which is a very important theme for Autodesk. And with that, I'm really excited, and I'm looking forward to him joining in December. Jason Celino -- Analyst OK. Great. Interesting. And then for my second question, now that you do have a CFO, do you have any thoughts on when you might hold the next Investor Day? I think in the past, you usually did it in March. Is that a good time frame? Or is that too soon? Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. Well, Janesh is joining in December. I think we need to give him time to get his sea legs on giving time to kind of drive the end of the year and actually get us set up for next fiscal year in good stead. So, I would say it's unlikely we'll be doing anything in the spring, but we'll get back to you on that as soon as Janesh is ready to talk about those things. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Your question, please. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst Thank you. Andrew, as of the third quarter, your three-year CAGR for current RPO is about 12%. How are you thinking about the sustainability or perhaps improvement upon that CAGR or CRPO over the next number of years? When we think about the ingredients of that, it looks like over the last several years, the CAGR for your unit volume for all brands is roughly 6% to 7% in the aggregate. So, on top of that, you've had price and other ingredients, but perhaps talk about how you think you might be able to improve upon the most recent trajectory for current RPO. Then my follow-up. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Hi, Jay, this is Betsy. Let me just give you a couple of things. There's a number of things that are going on, on the headline of the CRPO number. If you first take away the headwinds and the tailwinds was broadly consistent with the second quarter. And as I mentioned in my opening commentary, early renewals and growth with -- and the new transaction model are providing a tailwind. And then there's also a headwind to CRPO growth from the declining contribution of billed and unbilled deferred revenue risk from the large multiyear EBA cohorts coming up for renewal in fiscal '26. And just as a reminder, these are the same larger cohorts we are calling out as the tailwinds to free cash flow for next year. And if you look back to fiscal '22, we saw the same dynamic ahead of the fiscal '23 renewals as well. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst OK. Since new management is part of the news this evening, could you talk about how you're thinking about the chief revenue officer position. Would it make sense perhaps to continue to have a separate CRO? Or do you think it might make more sense perhaps to combine CRO and COO? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, we're going to continue to have a separate CRO because we have various functions that work together there under the COO organization, including our IT organization, our infrastructure and all things associated. What we're looking for in our CRO is someone that understands how to continue to drive a business when you have direct engagement with the customer. So, that means someone that really understands what it takes to analyze self-service patterns, actually understand the data that comes in from the customers to help drive cross-sell and upsell while also transforming a channel from a transactionally focused extension of Autodesk to kind of a solution partner that's driving life cycle solutions for our customers. So, that's the kind of role we're looking for here. And yes, it's going to continue to be a stand-alone CRO role within the COO organization. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Borg of Stifel. Your line is open. Adam Borg -- Analyst Awesome. Thanks so much for taking the questions, and congrats to Betsy and Janesh. Maybe on the new transaction model. I know it's still early. But I was just curious, are there any learnings from those customers that are on the new model that you're seeing in terms of the adoption of Autodesk technology and the ability to find white space to better upsell and cross-sell different solutions now that you have a more direct relationship. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah, Adam, it's really early on to be able to make any kind of conclusions about that. What I can tell you is that we definitely see some shifts to some of the direct channels at Autodesk for customers that were probably just served on a very kind of arm's length kind of transactional level. But in terms of driving cross-sell and upsell, early days, early days. But if you want to get a sense for how that might evolve, we've got experience with our EBAs and our enterprise business agreements. And we've learned over the years that having that kind of relationship with the customer where we really understand their usage patterns, who they are and what they're doing, we are much more effective at driving cross-sell and upsell even when partnering with our channel partners. So, I think those kind of stand as a testament of what's possible as we move forward with completion of the new transaction model. Adam Borg -- Analyst Great. And maybe just as a quick follow-up. Just as we think about the new administration coming in, you talked about the macro being broadly consistent. Any change in tone in your conversations with the end markets in terms of optimism or their ability or willingness to expand new projects ahead of the administration? Any pause or just full steam ahead? I'm just curious, any commentary you have there from a macro perspective would be really, really helpful. Thanks so much. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director What I'll say is the things that matter to our customers are bipartisan things, all right? Our customers care about infrastructure builds out. Both parties care about infrastructure build-outs. Our customers care about domestic manufacturing in Europe, be it in the United States, both parties agree that the domestic manufacturing build-outs are important. Supply chain, independent, supply chain stability. All of these things are bipartisan issues that really affect our customers. So, regardless of the administration, I suspect the things that are important to our customers are continuing to be a focus. Adam Borg -- Analyst Thanks, again. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink of Baird. Please go ahead, Joe. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst Thank you. On the outlook for next year, $2.050 billion in free cash has, I think, been the expectation for the past year now. Within the last year, you've also seen more co-term of contracts. And I think that leads to better billings in FY '26. So, my question is, does that actually create the potential that things are better, and that's why you're qualifying now the $2.050 billion as the midpoint of possibilities. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer There's no change to how we've talked about the free cash flow guide for fiscal '26, it continues to be $2.05 billion at the mid-point. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst OK. Fair enough. And then just on the M&A environment, over recent history, Autodesk has been more in a mode of, I would say, strategic tuck-ins. I think there is actually an asset in the CFD simulation space that was announced during AU in the quarter. Is that the right approach for Autodesk, just given this point in time, all the work you've done to build out the cloud platform, the data models, and so these tuck-ins make the most sense? And if that's true, how would you maybe compare and contrast some of the larger-scale M&A that's happening with your peers in the space? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, look, consolidation in our space is inevitable. I'm not going to comment on any specific deals, but here's what I'll say. Autodesk has always been an acquisitive company, and we will be an inquisitive company when that makes both strategic and financial sense for the company. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst OK. Thank you. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Joe. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Porter of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Elizabeth. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great, thanks so much for the question. As partners are getting customers just up and running on the new transaction model, we picked up that they're spending a little bit more time than usual of time and resources with those existing customers. So, I was curious if that had any impact on new business demand kind of more recently -- and then just more broadly, any change in new business trends that you think you should call out from versus last quarter? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Elizabeth, it's Betsy. And so, just broadly speaking, we continue to see growth, but at a slower pace due to a number of factors really over the last several years, macro, COVID, exiting Russia, elections, and while a drag on the forward momentum of the business, all of that really factored into our guidance. So, I kind of just will leave it at that. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great. And then a follow-up just on billings. I understand there's a lot of volatility around the change from multiyear in the transaction model. But it looks like guidance implies a bigger step down in growth in Q4, just despite easier year-ago compare. So, hoping that you could help us unpack the balance of those headwinds and tailwinds that would drive kind of a greater downtick in growth in Q4. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, again, let me start out with just from a fiscal '25 perspective. Your billing tailwinds are going to be from the final shift to annual billings, new transaction model and early renewals. And you're going to get headwinds from co-terming and business booked ahead of the new transaction model launch and in recent weeks, some FX. So, again, I think that we've continued to perform well as we've executed through through Q3. And so, I think we feel very, very strongly about our expectations for Q4. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bhavin Shah of Deutsche Bank. Your question please, Bhavin. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Great, thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the quarter. Andrew, at university, there appeared to be a noticeable uptick in attendance and sessions geared toward owners and operators. What been driving the recent interest from the segment? How much of it is product enhancements you guys have made versus really more focusing and emphasizing from a go-to-market perspective? And how long before this segment of buyers kind of becomes more meaningful to the financials? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah, Bhavin, that's an excellent question, right. We're very interested in tackling the whole entire life cycle from design, through make, construction, manufacturing, all the way into operations. You're probably aware we have a product called Tandem. And a lot of those sessions were driven by increasing interest and increasing adoption of Tandem, which is a digital twin solution, tightly coupled to our solutions that also has a toolkit that allows people to easily connect sensor data through the digital twin solution. So, you're seeing that uptick because we're directly releasing products and capabilities that are of interest to the owner space. You can expect to see that trend continue over time, and you can expect to see us continue to talk about the owner space, continue to deliver solutions for the owner space and even APIs for the owner space. It's an area of great interest, especially when it comes not only to vertical buildings, but factories and other things that are related to that as well as, infrastructure like what we were doing with some of our water owner solutions. So, yes, owners matter. We're building software for them, and you're going to see more of that. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Super helpful there. And then, Betsy, one for you. Just in terms of the underlying improvement that we've been seeing in the margins, and I know you've called out FX and the transaction model. I know it's very early, but as you think about next year, how do we think about like the impact of FX and the transaction model to kind of the headline operating margins? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, I wish I could give you that answer, but I think that the new CFO would probably have a little bit of a problem with that. So, we'll wait till the end of February to give you more specifics on that. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Fair enough. Thanks for taking may questions. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Good try. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke of Citi. Please go ahead, Tyler. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Yeah, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I was going to ask you about a placeholder for next year's guidance, Betsy. don't want to waste a question on that, but feel free to answer. But Andrew, I wanted to kind of ask you about some of your comments you made around efficiency, especially as it relates to hiring Janesh, who you pointed out has a lot of experience at larger companies, VMware, Cisco, et cetera. Now that you're a few quarters into this transaction model rollout, you have kind of visibility better on some of the channel prior channel relationships, having that direct billing with the customer. What are some of the areas that you've identified as having that efficiency potential? And then as we think about that efficiency unlock, should we think about that as incremental to the free cash flow number you have out for next year? Or is that embedded in that already. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director So, many layers to that question. All right. First, let me kind of answer the question in a series of stages then dodge other ones, OK? So, first off, optimization is kind of a mindset at Autodesk. It's not something that that suddenly happens. I want to reemphasize that because if you look right now, this year, for example, when you look at the apples-to-apples comparison, which will be in the slide decks, are in our disclosed materials you can see that our non-GAAP margins are already hitting the targets we set for next year this year, OK? So, optimization is a mentality. You've also heard me say over and over again as the new transaction model starts to roll out, optimization of our go-to-market efforts is going to be a critical step for us and part of the optimization journey that we're on, that's going to deliver margin growth for the company for couple of years to come, OK? And I think that's important. It's a long-term driver. Now with getting into the specifics, OK? I think the specifics are probably for another time, but let me just kind of give you a sense for some of the things that are important, right? One is the drive to self-service, right? Self-service is a huge impact on how our customers will engage with us and where those customers come from, and that is value accretive to Autodesk, both on an efficiency side, from renewals and other things, but also on the revenue growth side through capturing the customers directly. The other thing I talked about is understanding the customer better, so the upsell and cross-sell. So, we're going to be able to do a lot more automation and understanding about where the opportunities are, and that's going to drive some efficiencies. And we're moving the channel partners away from this model of being the transactional players to being the solution providers and the IP providers to our customers. That's going to have all sorts of opportunities to eliminate duplication of effort and drive real cost efficiencies for the company moving forward. There's both top-line efficiencies here in revenue growth, but there's bottom line efficiencies as well through removing the redundancies and steps that just aren't necessary for the customer. You'll get a lot more clarity on that as you see us continue to move forward with this go-to-market optimization in the next year and beyond that. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Great. And then my follow-up question, Andrew, you talked about some really strong net new customer additions within the Construction Cloud, I think, doubling year over year. we also saw the Make revenue accelerate to 28% constant currency. Can you just help us understand, do you think that reacceleration is durable? And how are you sort of thinking about just your position there? What's been driving that strength in the new customer additions? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director First, let me comment on the make revenues, then I'm going to go into construction. So, the make revenue also includes some revenue from PIX and things associated with that. However, let's talk about the facts around our construction business because I think this is important, right? No. 1 factor is that we continue to drive consistent, high growth in our construction solutions. You're seeing it. It's built into the Make numbers, and it's the lion's share of those Make numbers. You're really seeing some consistent growth there. That's organically. Inorganically, we're actually executing incredibly well on things like Payapps, and that's driving acceleration of our growth. So, we are not decelerating as a business, OK? We are actually performing solidly inorganically, we're accelerating, all right? And I just want to be really clear about that. And yes, we said year over year, we drove a 2x increase in our new customers. And I'll talk about where some of that's coming from in just a minute. But I also want to highlight the other thing that's going on we are strengthening an already strong position in the ENR 400. So, you heard about the story about power construction, which was a great example of someone taking out a competitive RFP and say, look, I need a forward-looking cloud-based solution on new technology that goes end to end from design to construction all the way to operations. And they chose us. And that was just one example that we gave in the opening commentary. So, already a strengthening position in the ENR 400. Now the other qualitative things that are driving some of that new customer growth is we already have our distribution channel operating at scale. In the U.S., this is helping us go down market more effectively, which is allowing us to capture more customers more effectively be places where we weren't before and where others aren't, which is part of driving that. But also, we're already at scale operating internationally with our distribution channel. So, that's driving international growth for us. And that's a really important driver as well as, some of those net new accounts that you're seeing there. And the last thing I'll add that I'm done with construction is that, look, I heard this over and over again at AU, I'm hearing it over and over again from customers in lots of different places. They want the end-to-end solution. They want the licensed version in the cloud, they're placing bets for the next 10 years. They want to go from design to construction to operations, and that's just making our solution more attractive to the market. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo. Your question, please. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Hey, thanks very much. I appreciate you taking the questions. A commentary on the call sounded consistent, but wondering if there are any added details you can provide for us on just the overall macro spend environment and how that's maybe progressing across either key product segments or geos, whatever split you think is more useful. I think what we're trying to get a sense for is if there are any shades of improvement anywhere or if you'd characterize as mainly just consistent over the past couple of quarters. Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Michael, I think the core answer here is consistency, OK? We're seeing consistent trends that we've seen with -- in all the other quarters. There's always puts and takes in a large business like ours, especially ones as divers as ours. But the general tone is consistent with prior quarters. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer And I would just add that there's also been a lot of noise this year from the new transaction model and then obviously, the elections and leading up to that. And so, it's hard to sparse out kind of that particular behavior. So, I think as Andrew said, we call it consistent. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Yeah, tough for us, too. That's why we keep asking. Betsy, congrats on the transition back given you're also on the board. I think it'd be useful to hear you chime in on the hiring of Janesh and maybe just also comment on how you ensure you're able to hand over the reins and keep progress going on the key transitions the company is working through. Thanks. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Per se, I was involved in the process, which was quite extensive in the company and the recruiting of Janesh. And so, we're certainly very excited to have him on board. What I would also say is, obviously, with my experience of being on the board for 11 years as well as, my deep dive into the business over the last six months. One of the reasons I'm staying around until the end of the fiscal year, is I think I could be really helpful in that transition for Janesh. And so, I'm very much looking forward to it. And I think that we have a great finance team, and I think that he's going to fit very well, and I'm looking forward to making that happen as fast as we can. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. Your question, please, Matthew. Mike Richards -- Analyst Hey, guys. This is Mike Richards on for Matt. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could provide an update on Project Bernini and maybe how customer reception has been and where we are in developing other foundational models or just the monetization opportunity there? Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, first off, before I comment on Bernini, as you might have heard from AU, AI is embedded in everything we're doing from a bottom-up and a top-down perspective. And you also heard us talk at AU about new types of foundation models we're building that understand how certain things are done in our applications. You heard about a foundation model that's driving automated drawing creation. You heard about a foundation model that's driving automated sketch generation and sketch constraints. That kind of stuff is bottom-up innovation. Bernini more of a top-down type innovation where you're actually specifying things and trying to generate a preliminary outcome from those specifications. And what we've been doing with Bernini is we've been trying to engage with certain targeted customers to get them to participate with us in making Bernini smarter and more intelligent. It's not available commercially right now. but it's getting more intelligent. We've actually been successful in getting some customers to stand up and say, look, yes, I'd like to work with you to make this more intelligent because we need something that actually understands 3D geometry as geometry, not just in the picture or something, OK? So, that's what's going on with Bernini right now, and you should continue to see refinements and extensions of that moving forward. Now with regard to monetization, monetization, nobody knows exactly how all this is going to be monetized. But there's a few vectors here that that come into play. One, we are ahead of our competitors in this space. We intend to be ahead. We're investing to stay ahead. That increase ones competitive position in the marketplace, and that's really important. Also, you get to be able to charge for some of these incremental features in the future. When you're delivering value or a high-quality outcome as a result, you're going to charge for that outcome. How we charge for those things? Let's just play out, OK? It's still early days. But there's also monetization opportunities through licensing certain technologies for specific mature maturation for specific customers' needs, all right? And that will be another avenue. So, how these avenues play out, which one waits more, let this play out. But what you need to know about Autodesk is we're ahead. We've been ahead for a while. We were the first out there with an AI research lab that been out there for over six years. It's published 70 papers. We're right on the cutting edge of 3D design technology in AI, and we intend to stay there. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of J.P. Morgan. Your question please, Steve. Stephen Tusa -- Analyst Good evening or afternoon. Lots of good questions asked. Just a detailed one. What's the change in the billings contribution from the transaction model change? The five to six to five to five and a half. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Yeah. So, it's basically because we did more buy/sell business ahead of the European launch. It's short answer. So, remember, we said 5% to 6% when we launched Europe. And it was the -- we did more buy sell business, which means there's less tailwind from the new transaction model. The flip side of -- that means that the underlying increase in our billings guidance is greater than it looks on a headline basis. Stephen Tusa -- Analyst OK, great. Thanks a lot. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Tilton of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Hey, guys, can you hear me? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Great. I have a kind of a high-level one on the incoming CFO. If I heard correctly, we didn't exactly get like an initial outlook for revenue growth for next year. And I'm just trying to understand in the context of the new CFO coming in, is there anything that could change the calculus of how you guys think about that 10% to 15% growth for the underlying business outside of the agency transition that's ongoing today. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Well, first, let's talk about that framework a little bit, and then I'll comment a little bit on the incoming CFO. So, look, the 10% to 15% growth. Right now, we're pretty much right at the bottom end of that range. And if we look back over the last two years, there's been a series of things that created headwinds to new business. It started off with things like the pandemic, the inflation, the exiting of the Russian business, the writer's strike, the whole trade wars within particular geographies. All of these things were accumulated headwinds that build slowly into the business and have pushed us down to the low end of the range. it takes time in a subscription model for those things to build out of the business, OK? So, it's going to take time for us to build out of that. That's to be expected with a subscription model. The revenue goes down slowly. It goes back up slowly as headwinds turn into tailwinds. So, expect us to be near the bottom of that range in the short term just as a general kind of guideline for the core business to be at the bottom of the range, OK? As a long-term framework, the 10% to 15% still makes sense as a long-term guide for the company. But of course, as new eyes come in, we'll look at these things, and we'll evaluate them. But right now, this all still makes sense. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Super helpful. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho. Your question, please. Siti Panigrahi -- Analyst Thanks for taking my question. I understand the new business model of some kind of noise in your expense and margin side. But if you exclude that, where do you see some of the operating leverage that you can drive in next year or so? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, I think we've actually provided kind of historically what we've done over the last three years pretty clearly. And I think we said that we continue to be focused on expansion, but nothing further to add as far as next year. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director We did provide data on that. So, you can see what underlying thing is, and we expect to see continued improvement in that same vector. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations On the same basis. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director On the same basis, on the same apples-to-apples basis. Siti Panigrahi -- Analyst OK, great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Funk of Bank of America. Your question, please. Michael Funk -- Analyst Yeah. Guys, thank you for the question tonight. Two, if I could. You've mentioned a few times in the last calls about the largest multiyear cohort renewing next year and then also a large EBA cohort. Just wondering if you can give us kind of the range of potential outcomes among the renewals there, whether a potential to upsell, risk of down sell and what that variance might look like around those renewals? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer No. I mean I think what we have said is that it's the largest cohort and we saw that performance in '23. And so, we expect a strong renewal year, but we're not giving any specific guidance on what that looks like for '26 at this point, and we'll wait until we report earnings in February. Michael Funk -- Analyst OK. Great. And then, Betsy, one more. You've mentioned a few times after the investment in new transaction model, people processes, and automation, presumably more fixed cost versus variable like commission. Can you quantify that for us to help us with modeling as we try to forecast margin? I know you've not given guidance, but better understanding of what that cost might actually be on an absolute basis would help us to think about our modeling. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Mike, we've got a slide in the earnings deck to help you think about modeling. And I'll just point you to that. Michael Funk -- Analyst OK, great. Thank you, Simon. Operator Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for Q&A today. I would now like to turn the conference back to Simon Mays-Smith for closing remarks. Sir? Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Great. Thanks, Latif, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Looking forward to seeing many of you on the road over the next few weeks. If you have any questions in the meantime, please email me or call me. And in the meantime, for those of you in North America wishing you a very happy Thanksgiving. Thank you, Latif.

that's true, would maybe compare contrast larger-scale m&a that's happening peer space? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah. so, look, consolidation space inevitable. going comment specific deals, here's say. autodesk always acquisitive company, inquisitive company make strategic financial sense company. joe vruwink -- analyst ok. thank you. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director thank you, joe. operator thank you. next question come line elizabeth porter morgan stanley. please go ahead, elizabeth. elizabeth porter -- analyst great, thanks much question. partner getting customer running new transaction model, picked spending little bit time usual time resource existing customers. so, curious impact new business demand kind recently -- broadly, change new business trend think call versus last quarter? betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer yeah. elizabeth, betsy. so, broadly speaking, continue see growth, slower pace due number factor really last several years, macro, covid, exiting russia, elections, drag forward momentum business, really factored guidance. so, kind leave that. elizabeth porter -- analyst great. follow-up billings. understand there's lot volatility around change multiyear transaction model. look like guidance implies bigger step growth q4, despite easier year-ago compare. so, hoping could help u unpack balance headwind tailwind would drive kind greater downtick growth q4. betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer well, again, let start fiscal '25 perspective. billing tailwind going final shift annual billings, new transaction model early renewals. going get headwind co-terming business booked ahead new transaction model launch recent weeks, fx. so, again, think continued perform well executed q3. so, think feel very, strongly expectation q4. elizabeth porter -- analyst great. thank you. operator thank you. next question come line bhavin shah deutsche bank. question please, bhavin. bhavin shah -- analyst great, thanks taking question, congrats quarter. andrew, university, appeared noticeable uptick attendance session geared toward owner operators. driving recent interest segment? much product enhancement guy made versus really focusing emphasizing go-to-market perspective? long segment buyer kind becomes meaningful financials? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah, bhavin, that's excellent question, right. interested tackling whole entire life cycle design, make, construction, manufacturing, way operations. probably aware product called tandem. lot session driven increasing interest increasing adoption tandem, digital twin solution, tightly coupled solution also toolkit allows people easily connect sensor data digital twin solution. so, seeing uptick directly releasing product capability interest owner space. expect see trend continue time, expect see u continue talk owner space, continue deliver solution owner space even apis owner space. area great interest, especially come vertical buildings, factory thing related well as, infrastructure like water owner solutions. so, yes, owner matter. building software them, going see that. bhavin shah -- analyst super helpful there. then, betsy, one you. term underlying improvement seeing margins, know called fx transaction model. know early, think next year, think like impact fx transaction model kind headline operating margins? betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer well, wish could give answer, think new cfo would probably little bit problem that. so, wait till end february give specific that. bhavin shah -- analyst fair enough. thanks taking may questions. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director good try. operator thank you. next question come line tyler radke citi. please go ahead, tyler. tyler radke -- analyst yeah, good afternoon. thanks taking questions. going ask placeholder next year's guidance, betsy. want waste question that, feel free answer. andrew, wanted kind ask comment made around efficiency, especially relates hiring janesh, pointed lot experience larger companies, vmware, cisco, et cetera. quarter transaction model rollout, kind visibility better channel prior channel relationships, direct billing customer. area identified efficiency potential? think efficiency unlock, think incremental free cash flow number next year? embedded already. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director so, many layer question. right. first, let kind answer question series stage dodge ones, ok? so, first off, optimization kind mindset autodesk. something suddenly happens. want reemphasize look right now, year, example, look apples-to-apples comparison, slide decks, disclosed material see non-gaap margin already hitting target set next year year, ok? so, optimization mentality. also heard say new transaction model start roll out, optimization go-to-market effort going critical step u part optimization journey on, that's going deliver margin growth company couple year come, ok? think that's important. long-term driver. getting specifics, ok? think specific probably another time, let kind give sense thing important, right? one drive self-service, right? self-service huge impact customer engage u customer come from, value accretive autodesk, efficiency side, renewal things, also revenue growth side capturing customer directly. thing talked understanding customer better, upsell cross-sell. so, going able lot automation understanding opportunity are, that's going drive efficiencies. moving channel partner away model transactional player solution provider ip provider customers. that's going sort opportunity eliminate duplication effort drive real cost efficiency company moving forward. there's top-line efficiency revenue growth, there's bottom line efficiency well removing redundancy step necessary customer. get lot clarity see u continue move forward go-to-market optimization next year beyond that. tyler radke -- analyst great. follow-up question, andrew, talked really strong net new customer addition within construction cloud, think, doubling year year. also saw make revenue accelerate 28% constant currency. help u understand, think reacceleration durable? sort thinking position there? what's driving strength new customer additions? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director first, let comment make revenues, going go construction. so, make revenue also includes revenue pix thing associated that. however, let's talk fact around construction business think important, right? no. 1 factor continue drive consistent, high growth construction solutions. seeing it. built make numbers, lion's share make numbers. really seeing consistent growth there. that's organically. inorganically, actually executing incredibly well thing like payapps, that's driving acceleration growth. so, decelerating business, ok? actually performing solidly inorganically, accelerating, right? want really clear that. yes, said year year, drove 2x increase new customers. talk that's coming minute. also want highlight thing that's going strengthening already strong position enr 400. so, heard story power construction, great example someone taking competitive rfp say, look, need forward-looking cloud-based solution new technology go end end design construction way operations. chose us. one example gave opening commentary. so, already strengthening position enr 400. qualitative thing driving new customer growth already distribution channel operating scale. u.s., helping u go market effectively, allowing u capture customer effectively place others aren't, part driving that. also, already scale operating internationally distribution channel. so, that's driving international growth us. that's really important driver well as, net new account seeing there. last thing add done construction that, look, heard au, hearing customer lot different places. want end-to-end solution. want licensed version cloud, placing bet next 10 years. want go design construction operations, that's making solution attractive market. operator thank you. next question come line michael turrin well fargo. question, please. michael turrin -- analyst hey, thanks much. appreciate taking questions. commentary call sounded consistent, wondering added detail provide u overall macro spend environment that's maybe progressing across either key product segment geos, whatever split think useful. think trying get sense shade improvement anywhere characterize mainly consistent past couple quarters. thanks. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director michael, think core answer consistency, ok?

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Simon Mays-Smith, VP, investor relations. Please go ahead. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Thanks, operator, and good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the third quarter results of Autodesk's fiscal '25.

During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including outlook and related assumptions and on product and strategies. Actual events or results could differ materially. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-Q and the Form 8-K filed with today's press release for important risks and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today. If this call is replayed or reviewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Autodesk disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will quote several numeric or growth changes during this call as we discuss our financial performance. Unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison. All non-GAAP numbers referenced in today's call are reconciled in our press release or Excel financials and other supplemental materials available on our Investor Relations website. And now, I will turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Simon, and welcome, everyone, to the call. We finished the third quarter of the year strongly, delivering 12% revenue growth in constant currency and have again raised full year guidance. This reflects the sustained momentum of the business and successful execution of our strategy, including a smooth implementation of the new transaction model in Western Europe. Once again, opportunity, resilience and discipline underpinned our performance. Last month at Autodesk University in San Diego, we hosted 12,000 registered attendees and another 30,000 online. We showed how granular data in the cloud, organized the data models and connected to everything through APIs to deliver even more valuable and connected solutions for customers and partners and support a much broader ecosystem and marketplace. Customers and channel partners that I spoke with at AU remain cautiously optimistic, a sentiment consistent with the underlying momentum of our business, our growing product usage and BuildingConnected bid activity trends over recent quarters. I left AU with a tremendous sense of purpose and optimism in the ingenuity and persistence of our customers and for the future. On our earnings call last quarter, I set out our secular growth opportunities and our strategy to capitalize on them. I concluded that Autodesk's investment in cloud, platform and AI in pursuit of those opportunities were ahead of its peers. AU was a good demonstration of that. But we're also leading the industry in modernizing our go-to-market motion starting a few years ago with the subscription transition through consumption and self-service enablement and more recently to direct billing. These initiatives enable Autodesk to build larger and more durable direct relationships with its customers and to serve them more efficiently. We have already seen significant benefits from initiatives like these, and there's more to come in the next optimization phase. Taking out the effects on margins from FX and the new transaction model, we still expect to be toward the midpoint of our fiscal '26 non-GAAP operating margin target of 38% to 40% in fiscal '25, a year ahead of schedule. We're confident we will make further improvement in fiscal '26 on the same basis. The new transaction model will enable tighter channel partnerships with less duplication of effort and more digital self-service and automation, which increases customer satisfaction and workforce productivity. It will also create new opportunities for partners Autodesk to earn more with less emphasis on transaction revenue sharing and a greater emphasis on value creation for customers. Once complete, we expect the new transaction model and subsequent go-to-market optimization to increase sales and marketing efficiency and deliver GAAP margins among the best in the industry. Attractive, long-term, secular growth markets, a focused strategy delivering ever more valuable and connected solutions to our customers, and a resilient business are generating strong and sustained momentum, both in absolute terms and relative to peers. Disciplined execution and capital deployment has driven even greater operational velocity and efficiency within Autodesk and will underpin the mechanical build of revenue and free cash flow over the next few years and GAAP margins among the best in the industry. We will continue to deploy capital to offset and buy forward dilution as our free cash flow grows from the fiscal '24 trough. This practice has reduced our share count over the last three years. We have significantly increased our share repurchase authorization to extend this momentum flexibility over the medium term, with the precise trajectory remaining dependent on our debt repayment schedule and the ebb and flow of M&A. In combination, we believe these factors will deliver sustainable shareholder value over many years. Before I conclude, I'd like to formally welcome Janesh to Autodesk. We're excited to welcome Janesh, who brings a wealth of experience and will be instrumental in sustaining Autodesk's growth and enhanced profitability momentum. Of equal importance, I'd like to thank Betsy for stepping in as interim CFO at an important time in the company's journey, and I'm looking forward to continuing to work closely with her as an Autodesk Board member. I will now turn the call over to Betsy to discuss our quarterly financial performance and guidance for the year. I'll then return to provide an update on our strategic growth initiatives. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Andrew. Q3 was another strong quarter. We generated broad-based underlying growth across products and regions. In addition, we saw revenue increases from the new transaction model and M&A which were offset by the absence of enterprise business agreement true-ups from Q3 last year and FX. Our Make products continued to enhance growth, driven by our ongoing strength in construction and Fusion. Overall, macroeconomic policy and geopolitical challenges and the underlying momentum of the business were consistent with the last few quarters, with continued strong renewal rates and headwinds to our new business growth. Total revenue grew 11% and 12% in constant currency. By product, in constant currency, AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT revenue grew 8%. AEC revenue, which was most impacted by the absence of true-up revenues, grew 12%, Manufacturing revenue grew 16% and still comfortably in double digits, excluding upfront revenue. And M&E revenue grew 15% boosted by the PIX acquisition and associated integration adjustments. By region, in constant currency, revenue grew 11% in the Americas which was most impacted by the absence of true-up revenues, 13% in EMEA and 14% in APAC. The mechanical contribution from the new transaction model to revenue was $17 million in the third quarter and $25 million on a year-to-date basis. Direct revenue increased 23% and represented 42% of total revenue, up 4 percentage points from last year, benefiting from strong growth in both EBAs and the Autodesk store and also the natural tailwind to revenue from the new transaction model. Net revenue retention rate remained within the 100% to 110% range at constant exchange rates. Billings increased 28% in the quarter, reflecting a tailwind from the prior-year shift to annual billings for most multiyear contracts, early renewals and the natural tailwind from the transition to the new transaction model. Similar to last quarter, and as expected, co-terming negatively impacted billing ahead of the launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe. The natural contribution from the new transaction model to billing was $72 million in the third quarter and $108 million on a year-to-date basis. Total deferred revenue decreased 9% to $3.7 billion and was again impacted by the transition from upfront to annual billings for multiyear contracts. Total RPO of $6.1 billion and current RPO of $4.0 billion grew 17% and 14%, respectively, which reflects a tailwind from early renewals and the new transaction model and a headwind from the declining contribution of billed and unbilled deferred revenue from large, multiyear and EBA cohorts ahead of renewal in fiscal '26. Excluding these, current RPO growth was broadly consistent with Q2. We do expect the new transaction model and the larger FY '26 renewal cohorts to have a greater impact on both RPO and current RPO growth in Q4 of fiscal '25. Turning to margins. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were broadly low. With Autodesk University shifting back to Q3 this year from Q4 last year, GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins decreased by 2 and 3 percentage points, respectively. The timing effect from AU obviously washes out over the full year. At current course and speed, the ratio of stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue peaked in fiscal '24, will follow by more than a percentage point in fiscal '25 and will be below 10% over time. Free cash flow for the quarter was $199 million. This benefited from some channel partners in Western Europe booking business earlier in the quarter ahead of the transition to the new transaction model really to derisk month one after the transition. This accelerated free cash flow to the third quarter, which was partially offset by the expected negative impact of co-terming in Western Europe. Turning now to capital allocation. We continue to actively manage capital within our framework and deploy it with discipline and focus through the economic cycle to drive long-term shareholder value. As expected, the pace of buybacks picked up in the third quarter. We purchased approximately 1.2 million shares for $319 million at an average price of approximately $269 per share. We will continue to deploy capital to offset and buy forward dilution as our free cash flow grows from the fiscal '24 trough. This practice has reduced our share count by about 5 million shares over the last three years with an average percentage reduction of about 70 basis points per year. We increased the amount authorized under our share repurchase program by $5 billion for a total of approximately $9 billion. This expands our flexibility over the medium term with the precise trajectory remaining dependent on our debt repayment schedule as well as, the ebbs and flow of M&A. Now let me finish with guidance. As we said in the February, the pace of the rollout of the new transaction model will create noise in billings and the P&L. So, we think free cash flow is the best measure of our performance. Taking out that noise, the underlying momentum in the business remains consistent with the expectations embedded in our guidance range for the full year with continued strong renewal rates and headwinds to new business growth. Our sustained momentum in the third quarter and smooth launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe, reduced the likelihood of our more cautious forecast scenario. Given that, we're raising the midpoint of our billing, revenue, margin, earnings per share and free cash flow guidance ranges. So, let me give you a little bit more detail. The underlying momentum of billing is in line with our expectations. Compared to our modeling at the start of the year, the launch of the new transaction model in Western Europe in Q3 and early renewals have been a tailwind for billings, whereas more co-terming, more business done under the old buy-sell model before the launch of the new transaction model and in recent weeks, FX movement have been headwinds for billing. We now estimate that the new transaction model will provide between a 5 and 5.5 percentage point tailwind to billings growth in fiscal '25. We've raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 billings guidance by $10 million to a range of $5.90 billion to $5.98 billion. The underlying momentum of revenue is also in line with our expectations. We estimate the new transaction model will provide around 1 to 1.5 percentage point tailwind to revenue growth in fiscal '25. Upfront revenue contributed 2 percentage points to revenue growth in Q4 of fiscal '24, and therefore, this is a headwind in Q4 of fiscal '25. While not large enough to call out at the start of the year, it was already factored into our Q4 and our full year model. We've raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 revenue guidance range by $18 million to a range of $6.12 billion to $6.13 billion. We're increasing our GAAP and non-GAAP margin guidance midpoint by 25 basis points by raising the bottom end of the ranges by 50 basis points. The GAAP margin guidance range is now 21.5% to 22%. The non-GAAP margin guidance range is now 35.5% to 36%, which includes a 1 to 1.5 percentage point underlying margin improvement, broadly offset by the margin headwinds from the new transaction model and the related incremental investments in people, processes and automation. The underlying momentum of free cash flow is also in line with our expectations. The headwind to billings from co-terming and FX rates that I mentioned earlier, is being offset by early renewals, faster collections and improved underlying margins. We raised the midpoint of our fiscal '25 free cash flow guidance by $10 million and tightened the range to $1.47 billion to $1.5 billion. We expect strong free cash flow growth in fiscal '26 because of the return of our largest multiyear renewal cohort the natural mechanical stacking of multiyear contracts billed annually and a larger EBA cohort. With our current trajectory, we still estimate free cash flow in fiscal '26 to be around $2.05 billion at the midpoint. The slide deck on our website has more details on modeling assumptions for Q3 and for the full fiscal year '25. And while this may be my last earnings call for Autodesk, I will stick around for a bit to ensure a smooth transition to Janesh. Thank you, Andrew, and everyone at Autodesk for your support while I was here and to the many investors and the analysts with whom I've had lively discussions over the last few quarters. While the transition to annual billings for multiyear contracts and the deployment of the new transaction model has created noise and billings in the P&L, they do provide a natural near-term tailwind to revenue and free cash flow growth. Combined with a resilient business model, sustained competitive momentum, Autodesk has enviable sources of visibility and certainty to very uncertain world. For all these reasons, I stepped down from my role as interim CFO with tremendous optimism for the future. Andrew, back to you. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Betsy. Let me finish by updating you on our strong progress in the third quarter. We continue to see good momentum in AEC, particularly in infrastructure and construction, fueled by customers consolidating onto our solutions to connect and optimize previously siloed workflows through the cloud. The cornerstone of that growing interest is our comprehensive end-to-end solutions in completing designs, preconstruction, field execution through handover and into operations. This breadth of connected capability enables us to extend our footprint further into infrastructure and construction and also expand our reach into the mid-market. As a sign of our growing momentum as the benefits of our end-to-end solution become more apparent, our construction business continue to perform robustly with net new customers doubling year over year and existing customers' renewal and expansion rates remaining strong. Let me give you a few examples. Power Construction is No. 79 on the Engineering News Record, ENR Top 400 U.S. contractor list. It is a Chicago-based general contractor serving residential and nonresidential end markets. After completing a competitive RFP to replace its legacy project management tool, Power selected Autodesk for its unified construction platform across preconstruction, construction, and DDC. By standardizing on Autodesk Construction Cloud, Power will have a single source of truth for project data, enhanced collaboration capabilities, and streamlined workflows on a single platform. Power Construction was one of two ENR 400 top 100 U.S. contractors that standardized enterprisewide on Autodesk build during the quarter. In Europe, Bouygues, a top 10 ENR 250 international contractor based in France and a leader in sustainable building and infrastructure projects renewed and expanded its EBA in the quarter. Bouygues is continuing to consolidate on Autodesk solutions across the enterprise, including broader adoption of Autodesk Forma, Carbon Insight, and Informed Design to digitize, decarbonize, and industrialize projects. It also significantly increased its commitment to Autodesk Construction Cloud to drive efficiency gains and faster bid response times through better collaboration between design and project teams. Surbana Jurong is No. 23 on ENR's top 225 international design firms. Based in Singapore, it is an urban infrastructure and integrated solutions consulting firm. In Q3, it renewed its third EBA, which included increased investment in Autodesk Construction Cloud and Autodesk Water infrastructure solutions. ACC is helping to scale its operations through increased automation, integrated design workflows and enhanced collaboration across time zones. Our water infrastructure solutions will be a core technology supporting its growth ambitions in planning, designing, engineering and managing water projects for customers worldwide. Again, these stories have a common theme. Managing people, processes and data across the project life cycle to increase efficiency and sustainability while decreasing risk. Over time, we expect the majority of all projects to be managed this way, and we remain focused on enabling that transition through our industry cloud. Moving on to manufacturing. We made excellent progress on our strategic initiatives. Customers continue to invest in their digital transformation and consolidate our Design and Make platform. Fusion remains one of the fastest-growing products in the manufacturing industry. As customers seek to drive innovation and growth at lower cost, Fusion extension attach rates are increasing, which is helping to drive the average sales price higher. For example, in the quarter, a global manufacturer supplying the semiconductor industry selected Fusion Manage and Vault PLM over competitive solutions to foster greater collaboration across manufacturing sites and improve operating efficiency. Once fully scaled and operational, this customer expects to save 105,000 hours per year by connecting people and data, resulting in reduced product development costs and faster time to market. In the U.K., Playdale Playground has been designing, manufacturing, and installing outdoor playground equipment for over 40 years. This quarter, Playdale added Fusion to its existing portfolio of Autodesk solutions, including Inventor, AutoCAD, and Vault to streamline and digitize workflows, optimize production to reduce lead times, reduce nonconformities, and replace inefficient Excel-driven operations on the shop floor. A long time Autodesk customer and global leader in precision engineering solutions renewed and expanded its EBA in the quarter. In addition to Inventor, vault and AutoCAD, it is adopting Fusion's generative design capabilities for material waste reduction and fluid flow optimization and Moldflow to reduce manufacturing costs and defects while increasing mold yields. In education, universities continue to modernize their courses and curriculum to attract and prepare future engineers. For example, from this winter, students at the University of Stuttgart, Institute for Medical Device Technology will use Fusion across six courses. Fusion was selected to replace a competitive solution for its modern platform, ease of use, cloud collaboration capabilities and unique combination of PCB and additive manufacturing workflows in a single team environment. And lastly, we continue to work with our customers to ensure they are using the latest and most secure versions of our software. For example, after a period of rapid scaling and diversification, a large multinational manufacturing company in APAC was looking to align compliance rates across its global employee base. Working collaboratively we address compliance issues while cementing a long-term partnership and completing one of our largest ever license compliance agreements, which included expanded adoption of Alias and VRED for the Design Studio and PDMC for mechanical engineering and rail design. Attractive long-term secular growth markets, a focused strategy delivering ever more valuable and connected solutions to our customers and a resilient business are generating strong and sustained momentum both in absolute terms and relative to peers. Disciplined execution and capital deployment is driving an even greater operational velocity and efficiency within Autodesk, and we continue to deploy capital to deliver sustainable shareholder value over many years. I retain a tremendous sense of purpose and optimism in the ingenuity and persistence of our customers and for the future. Operator, we would now like to open the call up for questions. Questions & Answers: Operator Thank you. [Operator instructions] Again, please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Jason Celino of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your question, please. Jason Celino -- Analyst Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Just two for me. The first one, Andrew. Some of us are unfamiliar with Janesh. Can you just tell us a little bit more about him and what he brings to Autodesk? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director I certainly can. Before I do that, let me make sure that I thank Betsy for everything she brought to Autodesk during this interim period. I really appreciate it. The company appreciates it. Thank you, Betsy. Now we're really excited about Janesh. Let me tell you why we're excited about Janesh. As you remember, one of the things I was telling you that I was looking for was someone that was going to be able to dispassionately drive optimization at scale inside of Autodesk. And what that really means is someone that's going to be really inwardly focused, looking at every dollar that we invest and making sure that we're getting the most return for the business that investors are getting the best return from their business. The next kind of criteria we were looking for, which was nice to have was, time in the seat as a sitting CFO, which was important for us as well. But it was kind of the next nice to have after the optimization at scale. Janesh brings a great balance of both of those things, right? He's been in the seat seven years at Elastic, both CFO and COO, driving some fairly turbulent changes inside of Elastic. So, he's got battle stars from pushing inside the company to get changes done inside, and we like that. We like that a lot. He's also got very good early experience at companies that we feel have always added value to Autodesk. So, he was it VMware in a senior position. He was at Cisco in a senior position. We've had good success bringing people from those kind of companies. He worked at those companies driving optimization at scale, which is the No. 1 criteria I was looking for when we we're driving this work. He also has another nice to have. He's got knowledge of our industry. He spent two years at PTC in his career. He was actually recently on the PTC board. So, he understands our industry, and he'll be able to get up to speed pretty quickly. The No. 1 goal here drive optimization and scale over the next few years, make sure that we're getting everything we need from every dollar we invest, which is a very important theme for Autodesk. And with that, I'm really excited, and I'm looking forward to him joining in December. Jason Celino -- Analyst OK. Great. Interesting. And then for my second question, now that you do have a CFO, do you have any thoughts on when you might hold the next Investor Day? I think in the past, you usually did it in March. Is that a good time frame? Or is that too soon? Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. Well, Janesh is joining in December. I think we need to give him time to get his sea legs on giving time to kind of drive the end of the year and actually get us set up for next fiscal year in good stead. So, I would say it's unlikely we'll be doing anything in the spring, but we'll get back to you on that as soon as Janesh is ready to talk about those things. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Your question, please. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst Thank you. Andrew, as of the third quarter, your three-year CAGR for current RPO is about 12%. How are you thinking about the sustainability or perhaps improvement upon that CAGR or CRPO over the next number of years? When we think about the ingredients of that, it looks like over the last several years, the CAGR for your unit volume for all brands is roughly 6% to 7% in the aggregate. So, on top of that, you've had price and other ingredients, but perhaps talk about how you think you might be able to improve upon the most recent trajectory for current RPO. Then my follow-up. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Hi, Jay, this is Betsy. Let me just give you a couple of things. There's a number of things that are going on, on the headline of the CRPO number. If you first take away the headwinds and the tailwinds was broadly consistent with the second quarter. And as I mentioned in my opening commentary, early renewals and growth with -- and the new transaction model are providing a tailwind. And then there's also a headwind to CRPO growth from the declining contribution of billed and unbilled deferred revenue risk from the large multiyear EBA cohorts coming up for renewal in fiscal '26. And just as a reminder, these are the same larger cohorts we are calling out as the tailwinds to free cash flow for next year. And if you look back to fiscal '22, we saw the same dynamic ahead of the fiscal '23 renewals as well. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst OK. Since new management is part of the news this evening, could you talk about how you're thinking about the chief revenue officer position. Would it make sense perhaps to continue to have a separate CRO? Or do you think it might make more sense perhaps to combine CRO and COO? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, we're going to continue to have a separate CRO because we have various functions that work together there under the COO organization, including our IT organization, our infrastructure and all things associated. What we're looking for in our CRO is someone that understands how to continue to drive a business when you have direct engagement with the customer. So, that means someone that really understands what it takes to analyze self-service patterns, actually understand the data that comes in from the customers to help drive cross-sell and upsell while also transforming a channel from a transactionally focused extension of Autodesk to kind of a solution partner that's driving life cycle solutions for our customers. So, that's the kind of role we're looking for here. And yes, it's going to continue to be a stand-alone CRO role within the COO organization. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Analyst Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Borg of Stifel. Your line is open. Adam Borg -- Analyst Awesome. Thanks so much for taking the questions, and congrats to Betsy and Janesh. Maybe on the new transaction model. I know it's still early. But I was just curious, are there any learnings from those customers that are on the new model that you're seeing in terms of the adoption of Autodesk technology and the ability to find white space to better upsell and cross-sell different solutions now that you have a more direct relationship. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah, Adam, it's really early on to be able to make any kind of conclusions about that. What I can tell you is that we definitely see some shifts to some of the direct channels at Autodesk for customers that were probably just served on a very kind of arm's length kind of transactional level. But in terms of driving cross-sell and upsell, early days, early days. But if you want to get a sense for how that might evolve, we've got experience with our EBAs and our enterprise business agreements. And we've learned over the years that having that kind of relationship with the customer where we really understand their usage patterns, who they are and what they're doing, we are much more effective at driving cross-sell and upsell even when partnering with our channel partners. So, I think those kind of stand as a testament of what's possible as we move forward with completion of the new transaction model. Adam Borg -- Analyst Great. And maybe just as a quick follow-up. Just as we think about the new administration coming in, you talked about the macro being broadly consistent. Any change in tone in your conversations with the end markets in terms of optimism or their ability or willingness to expand new projects ahead of the administration? Any pause or just full steam ahead? I'm just curious, any commentary you have there from a macro perspective would be really, really helpful. Thanks so much. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director What I'll say is the things that matter to our customers are bipartisan things, all right? Our customers care about infrastructure builds out. Both parties care about infrastructure build-outs. Our customers care about domestic manufacturing in Europe, be it in the United States, both parties agree that the domestic manufacturing build-outs are important. Supply chain, independent, supply chain stability. All of these things are bipartisan issues that really affect our customers. So, regardless of the administration, I suspect the things that are important to our customers are continuing to be a focus. Adam Borg -- Analyst Thanks, again. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink of Baird. Please go ahead, Joe. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst Thank you. On the outlook for next year, $2.050 billion in free cash has, I think, been the expectation for the past year now. Within the last year, you've also seen more co-term of contracts. And I think that leads to better billings in FY '26. So, my question is, does that actually create the potential that things are better, and that's why you're qualifying now the $2.050 billion as the midpoint of possibilities. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer There's no change to how we've talked about the free cash flow guide for fiscal '26, it continues to be $2.05 billion at the mid-point. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst OK. Fair enough. And then just on the M&A environment, over recent history, Autodesk has been more in a mode of, I would say, strategic tuck-ins. I think there is actually an asset in the CFD simulation space that was announced during AU in the quarter. Is that the right approach for Autodesk, just given this point in time, all the work you've done to build out the cloud platform, the data models, and so these tuck-ins make the most sense? And if that's true, how would you maybe compare and contrast some of the larger-scale M&A that's happening with your peers in the space? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, look, consolidation in our space is inevitable. I'm not going to comment on any specific deals, but here's what I'll say. Autodesk has always been an acquisitive company, and we will be an inquisitive company when that makes both strategic and financial sense for the company. Joe Vruwink -- Analyst OK. Thank you. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Thank you, Joe. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Porter of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Elizabeth. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great, thanks so much for the question. As partners are getting customers just up and running on the new transaction model, we picked up that they're spending a little bit more time than usual of time and resources with those existing customers. So, I was curious if that had any impact on new business demand kind of more recently -- and then just more broadly, any change in new business trends that you think you should call out from versus last quarter? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Elizabeth, it's Betsy. And so, just broadly speaking, we continue to see growth, but at a slower pace due to a number of factors really over the last several years, macro, COVID, exiting Russia, elections, and while a drag on the forward momentum of the business, all of that really factored into our guidance. So, I kind of just will leave it at that. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great. And then a follow-up just on billings. I understand there's a lot of volatility around the change from multiyear in the transaction model. But it looks like guidance implies a bigger step down in growth in Q4, just despite easier year-ago compare. So, hoping that you could help us unpack the balance of those headwinds and tailwinds that would drive kind of a greater downtick in growth in Q4. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, again, let me start out with just from a fiscal '25 perspective. Your billing tailwinds are going to be from the final shift to annual billings, new transaction model and early renewals. And you're going to get headwinds from co-terming and business booked ahead of the new transaction model launch and in recent weeks, some FX. So, again, I think that we've continued to perform well as we've executed through through Q3. And so, I think we feel very, very strongly about our expectations for Q4. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bhavin Shah of Deutsche Bank. Your question please, Bhavin. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Great, thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the quarter. Andrew, at university, there appeared to be a noticeable uptick in attendance and sessions geared toward owners and operators. What been driving the recent interest from the segment? How much of it is product enhancements you guys have made versus really more focusing and emphasizing from a go-to-market perspective? And how long before this segment of buyers kind of becomes more meaningful to the financials? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah, Bhavin, that's an excellent question, right. We're very interested in tackling the whole entire life cycle from design, through make, construction, manufacturing, all the way into operations. You're probably aware we have a product called Tandem. And a lot of those sessions were driven by increasing interest and increasing adoption of Tandem, which is a digital twin solution, tightly coupled to our solutions that also has a toolkit that allows people to easily connect sensor data through the digital twin solution. So, you're seeing that uptick because we're directly releasing products and capabilities that are of interest to the owner space. You can expect to see that trend continue over time, and you can expect to see us continue to talk about the owner space, continue to deliver solutions for the owner space and even APIs for the owner space. It's an area of great interest, especially when it comes not only to vertical buildings, but factories and other things that are related to that as well as, infrastructure like what we were doing with some of our water owner solutions. So, yes, owners matter. We're building software for them, and you're going to see more of that. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Super helpful there. And then, Betsy, one for you. Just in terms of the underlying improvement that we've been seeing in the margins, and I know you've called out FX and the transaction model. I know it's very early, but as you think about next year, how do we think about like the impact of FX and the transaction model to kind of the headline operating margins? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, I wish I could give you that answer, but I think that the new CFO would probably have a little bit of a problem with that. So, we'll wait till the end of February to give you more specifics on that. Bhavin Shah -- Analyst Fair enough. Thanks for taking may questions. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Good try. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke of Citi. Please go ahead, Tyler. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Yeah, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I was going to ask you about a placeholder for next year's guidance, Betsy. don't want to waste a question on that, but feel free to answer. But Andrew, I wanted to kind of ask you about some of your comments you made around efficiency, especially as it relates to hiring Janesh, who you pointed out has a lot of experience at larger companies, VMware, Cisco, et cetera. Now that you're a few quarters into this transaction model rollout, you have kind of visibility better on some of the channel prior channel relationships, having that direct billing with the customer. What are some of the areas that you've identified as having that efficiency potential? And then as we think about that efficiency unlock, should we think about that as incremental to the free cash flow number you have out for next year? Or is that embedded in that already. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director So, many layers to that question. All right. First, let me kind of answer the question in a series of stages then dodge other ones, OK? So, first off, optimization is kind of a mindset at Autodesk. It's not something that that suddenly happens. I want to reemphasize that because if you look right now, this year, for example, when you look at the apples-to-apples comparison, which will be in the slide decks, are in our disclosed materials you can see that our non-GAAP margins are already hitting the targets we set for next year this year, OK? So, optimization is a mentality. You've also heard me say over and over again as the new transaction model starts to roll out, optimization of our go-to-market efforts is going to be a critical step for us and part of the optimization journey that we're on, that's going to deliver margin growth for the company for couple of years to come, OK? And I think that's important. It's a long-term driver. Now with getting into the specifics, OK? I think the specifics are probably for another time, but let me just kind of give you a sense for some of the things that are important, right? One is the drive to self-service, right? Self-service is a huge impact on how our customers will engage with us and where those customers come from, and that is value accretive to Autodesk, both on an efficiency side, from renewals and other things, but also on the revenue growth side through capturing the customers directly. The other thing I talked about is understanding the customer better, so the upsell and cross-sell. So, we're going to be able to do a lot more automation and understanding about where the opportunities are, and that's going to drive some efficiencies. And we're moving the channel partners away from this model of being the transactional players to being the solution providers and the IP providers to our customers. That's going to have all sorts of opportunities to eliminate duplication of effort and drive real cost efficiencies for the company moving forward. There's both top-line efficiencies here in revenue growth, but there's bottom line efficiencies as well through removing the redundancies and steps that just aren't necessary for the customer. You'll get a lot more clarity on that as you see us continue to move forward with this go-to-market optimization in the next year and beyond that. Tyler Radke -- Analyst Great. And then my follow-up question, Andrew, you talked about some really strong net new customer additions within the Construction Cloud, I think, doubling year over year. we also saw the Make revenue accelerate to 28% constant currency. Can you just help us understand, do you think that reacceleration is durable? And how are you sort of thinking about just your position there? What's been driving that strength in the new customer additions? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director First, let me comment on the make revenues, then I'm going to go into construction. So, the make revenue also includes some revenue from PIX and things associated with that. However, let's talk about the facts around our construction business because I think this is important, right? No. 1 factor is that we continue to drive consistent, high growth in our construction solutions. You're seeing it. It's built into the Make numbers, and it's the lion's share of those Make numbers. You're really seeing some consistent growth there. That's organically. Inorganically, we're actually executing incredibly well on things like Payapps, and that's driving acceleration of our growth. So, we are not decelerating as a business, OK? We are actually performing solidly inorganically, we're accelerating, all right? And I just want to be really clear about that. And yes, we said year over year, we drove a 2x increase in our new customers. And I'll talk about where some of that's coming from in just a minute. But I also want to highlight the other thing that's going on we are strengthening an already strong position in the ENR 400. So, you heard about the story about power construction, which was a great example of someone taking out a competitive RFP and say, look, I need a forward-looking cloud-based solution on new technology that goes end to end from design to construction all the way to operations. And they chose us. And that was just one example that we gave in the opening commentary. So, already a strengthening position in the ENR 400. Now the other qualitative things that are driving some of that new customer growth is we already have our distribution channel operating at scale. In the U.S., this is helping us go down market more effectively, which is allowing us to capture more customers more effectively be places where we weren't before and where others aren't, which is part of driving that. But also, we're already at scale operating internationally with our distribution channel. So, that's driving international growth for us. And that's a really important driver as well as, some of those net new accounts that you're seeing there. And the last thing I'll add that I'm done with construction is that, look, I heard this over and over again at AU, I'm hearing it over and over again from customers in lots of different places. They want the end-to-end solution. They want the licensed version in the cloud, they're placing bets for the next 10 years. They want to go from design to construction to operations, and that's just making our solution more attractive to the market. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo. Your question, please. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Hey, thanks very much. I appreciate you taking the questions. A commentary on the call sounded consistent, but wondering if there are any added details you can provide for us on just the overall macro spend environment and how that's maybe progressing across either key product segments or geos, whatever split you think is more useful. I think what we're trying to get a sense for is if there are any shades of improvement anywhere or if you'd characterize as mainly just consistent over the past couple of quarters. Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Michael, I think the core answer here is consistency, OK? We're seeing consistent trends that we've seen with -- in all the other quarters. There's always puts and takes in a large business like ours, especially ones as divers as ours. But the general tone is consistent with prior quarters. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer And I would just add that there's also been a lot of noise this year from the new transaction model and then obviously, the elections and leading up to that. And so, it's hard to sparse out kind of that particular behavior. So, I think as Andrew said, we call it consistent. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Yeah, tough for us, too. That's why we keep asking. Betsy, congrats on the transition back given you're also on the board. I think it'd be useful to hear you chime in on the hiring of Janesh and maybe just also comment on how you ensure you're able to hand over the reins and keep progress going on the key transitions the company is working through. Thanks. Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Per se, I was involved in the process, which was quite extensive in the company and the recruiting of Janesh. And so, we're certainly very excited to have him on board. What I would also say is, obviously, with my experience of being on the board for 11 years as well as, my deep dive into the business over the last six months. One of the reasons I'm staying around until the end of the fiscal year, is I think I could be really helpful in that transition for Janesh. And so, I'm very much looking forward to it. And I think that we have a great finance team, and I think that he's going to fit very well, and I'm looking forward to making that happen as fast as we can. Michael Turrin -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. Your question, please, Matthew. Mike Richards -- Analyst Hey, guys. This is Mike Richards on for Matt. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could provide an update on Project Bernini and maybe how customer reception has been and where we are in developing other foundational models or just the monetization opportunity there? Thanks. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. So, first off, before I comment on Bernini, as you might have heard from AU, AI is embedded in everything we're doing from a bottom-up and a top-down perspective. And you also heard us talk at AU about new types of foundation models we're building that understand how certain things are done in our applications. You heard about a foundation model that's driving automated drawing creation. You heard about a foundation model that's driving automated sketch generation and sketch constraints. That kind of stuff is bottom-up innovation. Bernini more of a top-down type innovation where you're actually specifying things and trying to generate a preliminary outcome from those specifications. And what we've been doing with Bernini is we've been trying to engage with certain targeted customers to get them to participate with us in making Bernini smarter and more intelligent. It's not available commercially right now. but it's getting more intelligent. We've actually been successful in getting some customers to stand up and say, look, yes, I'd like to work with you to make this more intelligent because we need something that actually understands 3D geometry as geometry, not just in the picture or something, OK? So, that's what's going on with Bernini right now, and you should continue to see refinements and extensions of that moving forward. Now with regard to monetization, monetization, nobody knows exactly how all this is going to be monetized. But there's a few vectors here that that come into play. One, we are ahead of our competitors in this space. We intend to be ahead. We're investing to stay ahead. That increase ones competitive position in the marketplace, and that's really important. Also, you get to be able to charge for some of these incremental features in the future. When you're delivering value or a high-quality outcome as a result, you're going to charge for that outcome. How we charge for those things? Let's just play out, OK? It's still early days. But there's also monetization opportunities through licensing certain technologies for specific mature maturation for specific customers' needs, all right? And that will be another avenue. So, how these avenues play out, which one waits more, let this play out. But what you need to know about Autodesk is we're ahead. We've been ahead for a while. We were the first out there with an AI research lab that been out there for over six years. It's published 70 papers. We're right on the cutting edge of 3D design technology in AI, and we intend to stay there. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of J.P. Morgan. Your question please, Steve. Stephen Tusa -- Analyst Good evening or afternoon. Lots of good questions asked. Just a detailed one. What's the change in the billings contribution from the transaction model change? The five to six to five to five and a half. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Yeah. So, it's basically because we did more buy/sell business ahead of the European launch. It's short answer. So, remember, we said 5% to 6% when we launched Europe. And it was the -- we did more buy sell business, which means there's less tailwind from the new transaction model. The flip side of -- that means that the underlying increase in our billings guidance is greater than it looks on a headline basis. Stephen Tusa -- Analyst OK, great. Thanks a lot. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Tilton of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Hey, guys, can you hear me? Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Yeah. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Great. I have a kind of a high-level one on the incoming CFO. If I heard correctly, we didn't exactly get like an initial outlook for revenue growth for next year. And I'm just trying to understand in the context of the new CFO coming in, is there anything that could change the calculus of how you guys think about that 10% to 15% growth for the underlying business outside of the agency transition that's ongoing today. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director Well, first, let's talk about that framework a little bit, and then I'll comment a little bit on the incoming CFO. So, look, the 10% to 15% growth. Right now, we're pretty much right at the bottom end of that range. And if we look back over the last two years, there's been a series of things that created headwinds to new business. It started off with things like the pandemic, the inflation, the exiting of the Russian business, the writer's strike, the whole trade wars within particular geographies. All of these things were accumulated headwinds that build slowly into the business and have pushed us down to the low end of the range. it takes time in a subscription model for those things to build out of the business, OK? So, it's going to take time for us to build out of that. That's to be expected with a subscription model. The revenue goes down slowly. It goes back up slowly as headwinds turn into tailwinds. So, expect us to be near the bottom of that range in the short term just as a general kind of guideline for the core business to be at the bottom of the range, OK? As a long-term framework, the 10% to 15% still makes sense as a long-term guide for the company. But of course, as new eyes come in, we'll look at these things, and we'll evaluate them. But right now, this all still makes sense. Joshua Tilton -- Analyst Super helpful. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho. Your question, please. Siti Panigrahi -- Analyst Thanks for taking my question. I understand the new business model of some kind of noise in your expense and margin side. But if you exclude that, where do you see some of the operating leverage that you can drive in next year or so? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Well, I think we've actually provided kind of historically what we've done over the last three years pretty clearly. And I think we said that we continue to be focused on expansion, but nothing further to add as far as next year. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director We did provide data on that. So, you can see what underlying thing is, and we expect to see continued improvement in that same vector. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations On the same basis. Andrew Anagnost -- President and Chief Executive Officer, and Director On the same basis, on the same apples-to-apples basis. Siti Panigrahi -- Analyst OK, great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Funk of Bank of America. Your question, please. Michael Funk -- Analyst Yeah. Guys, thank you for the question tonight. Two, if I could. You've mentioned a few times in the last calls about the largest multiyear cohort renewing next year and then also a large EBA cohort. Just wondering if you can give us kind of the range of potential outcomes among the renewals there, whether a potential to upsell, risk of down sell and what that variance might look like around those renewals? Betsy Rafael -- Interim Chief Financial Officer No. I mean I think what we have said is that it's the largest cohort and we saw that performance in '23. And so, we expect a strong renewal year, but we're not giving any specific guidance on what that looks like for '26 at this point, and we'll wait until we report earnings in February. Michael Funk -- Analyst OK. Great. And then, Betsy, one more. You've mentioned a few times after the investment in new transaction model, people processes, and automation, presumably more fixed cost versus variable like commission. Can you quantify that for us to help us with modeling as we try to forecast margin? I know you've not given guidance, but better understanding of what that cost might actually be on an absolute basis would help us to think about our modeling. Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Mike, we've got a slide in the earnings deck to help you think about modeling. And I'll just point you to that. Michael Funk -- Analyst OK, great. Thank you, Simon. Operator Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for Q&A today. I would now like to turn the conference back to Simon Mays-Smith for closing remarks. Sir? Simon Mays-Smith -- Vice President, Investor Relations Great. Thanks, Latif, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Looking forward to seeing many of you on the road over the next few weeks.

seat seven year elastic, cfo coo, driving fairly turbulent change inside elastic. so, got battle star pushing inside company get change done inside, like that. like lot. also got good early experience company feel always added value autodesk. so, vmware senior position. cisco senior position. good success bringing people kind companies. worked company driving optimization scale, no. 1 criterion looking driving work. also another nice have. got knowledge industry. spent two year ptc career. actually recently ptc board. so, understands industry, able get speed pretty quickly. no. 1 goal drive optimization scale next years, make sure getting everything need every dollar invest, important theme autodesk. that, really excited, looking forward joining december. jason celino -- analyst ok. great. interesting. second question, cfo, thought might hold next investor day? think past, usually march. good time frame? soon? thanks. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah. well, janesh joining december. think need give time get sea leg giving time kind drive end year actually get u set next fiscal year good stead. so, would say unlikely anything spring, get back soon janesh ready talk things. operator thank you. next question come line jay vleeschhouwer griffin securities. question, please. jay vleeschhouwer -- analyst thank you. andrew, third quarter, three-year cagr current rpo 12%. thinking sustainability perhaps improvement upon cagr crpo next number years? think ingredient that, look like last several years, cagr unit volume brand roughly 6% 7% aggregate. so, top that, price ingredients, perhaps talk think might able improve upon recent trajectory current rpo. follow-up. betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer yeah. hi, jay, betsy. let give couple things. there's number thing going on, headline crpo number. first take away headwind tailwind broadly consistent second quarter. mentioned opening commentary, early renewal growth -- new transaction model providing tailwind. there's also headwind crpo growth declining contribution billed unbilled deferred revenue risk large multiyear eba cohort coming renewal fiscal '26. reminder, larger cohort calling tailwind free cash flow next year. look back fiscal '22, saw dynamic ahead fiscal '23 renewal well. jay vleeschhouwer -- analyst ok. since new management part news evening, could talk thinking chief revenue officer position. would make sense perhaps continue separate cro? think might make sense perhaps combine cro coo? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah. so, going continue separate cro various function work together coo organization, including organization, infrastructure thing associated. looking cro someone understands continue drive business direct engagement customer. so, mean someone really understands take analyze self-service patterns, actually understand data come customer help drive cross-sell upsell also transforming channel transactionally focused extension autodesk kind solution partner that's driving life cycle solution customers. so, that's kind role looking here. yes, going continue stand-alone cro role within coo organization. jay vleeschhouwer -- analyst thank much. operator thank you. next question come line adam borg stifel. line open. adam borg -- analyst awesome. thanks much taking questions, congrats betsy janesh. maybe new transaction model. know still early. curious, learning customer new model seeing term adoption autodesk technology ability find white space better upsell cross-sell different solution direct relationship. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah, adam, really early able make kind conclusion that. tell definitely see shift direct channel autodesk customer probably served kind arm's length kind transactional level. term driving cross-sell upsell, early days, early days. want get sense might evolve, got experience ebas enterprise business agreements. learned year kind relationship customer really understand usage patterns, doing, much effective driving cross-sell upsell even partnering channel partners. so, think kind stand testament what's possible move forward completion new transaction model. adam borg -- analyst great. maybe quick follow-up. think new administration coming in, talked macro broadly consistent. change tone conversation end market term optimism ability willingness expand new project ahead administration? pause full steam ahead? curious, commentary macro perspective would really, really helpful. thanks much. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director say thing matter customer bipartisan things, right? customer care infrastructure build out. party care infrastructure build-outs. customer care domestic manufacturing europe, united states, party agree domestic manufacturing build-outs important. supply chain, independent, supply chain stability. thing bipartisan issue really affect customers. so, regardless administration, suspect thing important customer continuing focus. adam borg -- analyst thanks, again. operator thank you. next question come line joe vruwink baird. please go ahead, joe. joe vruwink -- analyst thank you. outlook next year, $2.050 billion free cash has, think, expectation past year now. within last year, also seen co-term contracts. think lead better billing fy '26. so, question is, actually create potential thing better, that's qualifying $2.050 billion midpoint possibilities. betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer there's change talked free cash flow guide fiscal '26, continues $2.05 billion mid-point. joe vruwink -- analyst ok. fair enough. m&a environment, recent history, autodesk mode of, would say, strategic tuck-ins. think actually asset cfd simulation space announced au quarter. right approach autodesk, given point time, work done build cloud platform, data models, tuck-ins make sense? that's true, would maybe compare contrast larger-scale m&a that's happening peer space? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah. so, look, consolidation space inevitable. going comment specific deals, here's say. autodesk always acquisitive company, inquisitive company make strategic financial sense company. joe vruwink -- analyst ok. thank you. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director thank you, joe. operator thank you. next question come line elizabeth porter morgan stanley. please go ahead, elizabeth. elizabeth porter -- analyst great, thanks much question. partner getting customer running new transaction model, picked spending little bit time usual time resource existing customers. so, curious impact new business demand kind recently -- broadly, change new business trend think call versus last quarter? betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer yeah. elizabeth, betsy. so, broadly speaking, continue see growth, slower pace due number factor really last several years, macro, covid, exiting russia, elections, drag forward momentum business, really factored guidance. so, kind leave that. elizabeth porter -- analyst great. follow-up billings. understand there's lot volatility around change multiyear transaction model. look like guidance implies bigger step growth q4, despite easier year-ago compare. so, hoping could help u unpack balance headwind tailwind would drive kind greater downtick growth q4. betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer well, again, let start fiscal '25 perspective. billing tailwind going final shift annual billings, new transaction model early renewals. going get headwind co-terming business booked ahead new transaction model launch recent weeks, fx. so, again, think continued perform well executed q3. so, think feel very, strongly expectation q4. elizabeth porter -- analyst great. thank you. operator thank you. next question come line bhavin shah deutsche bank. question please, bhavin. bhavin shah -- analyst great, thanks taking question, congrats quarter. andrew, university, appeared noticeable uptick attendance session geared toward owner operators. driving recent interest segment? much product enhancement guy made versus really focusing emphasizing go-to-market perspective? long segment buyer kind becomes meaningful financials? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director yeah, bhavin, that's excellent question, right. interested tackling whole entire life cycle design, make, construction, manufacturing, way operations. probably aware product called tandem. lot session driven increasing interest increasing adoption tandem, digital twin solution, tightly coupled solution also toolkit allows people easily connect sensor data digital twin solution. so, seeing uptick directly releasing product capability interest owner space. expect see trend continue time, expect see u continue talk owner space, continue deliver solution owner space even apis owner space. area great interest, especially come vertical buildings, factory thing related well as, infrastructure like water owner solutions. so, yes, owner matter. building software them, going see that. bhavin shah -- analyst super helpful there. then, betsy, one you. term underlying improvement seeing margins, know called fx transaction model. know early, think next year, think like impact fx transaction model kind headline operating margins? betsy rafael -- interim chief financial officer well, wish could give answer, think new cfo would probably little bit problem that. so, wait till end february give specific that. bhavin shah -- analyst fair enough. thanks taking may questions. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director good try. operator thank you. next question come line tyler radke citi. please go ahead, tyler. tyler radke -- analyst yeah, good afternoon. thanks taking questions. going ask placeholder next year's guidance, betsy. want waste question that, feel free answer. andrew, wanted kind ask comment made around efficiency, especially relates hiring janesh, pointed lot experience larger companies, vmware, cisco, et cetera. quarter transaction model rollout, kind visibility better channel prior channel relationships, direct billing customer. area identified efficiency potential? think efficiency unlock, think incremental free cash flow number next year? embedded already. andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director so, many layer question. right. first, let kind answer question series stage dodge ones, ok? so, first off, optimization kind mindset autodesk. something suddenly happens. want reemphasize look right now, year, example, look apples-to-apples comparison, slide decks, disclosed material see non-gaap margin already hitting target set next year year, ok? so, optimization mentality. also heard say new transaction model start roll out, optimization go-to-market effort going critical step u part optimization journey on, that's going deliver margin growth company couple year come, ok? think that's important. long-term driver. getting specifics, ok? think specific probably another time, let kind give sense thing important, right? one drive self-service, right? self-service huge impact customer engage u customer come from, value accretive autodesk, efficiency side, renewal things, also revenue growth side capturing customer directly. thing talked understanding customer better, upsell cross-sell. so, going able lot automation understanding opportunity are, that's going drive efficiencies. moving channel partner away model transactional player solution provider ip provider customers. that's going sort opportunity eliminate duplication effort drive real cost efficiency company moving forward. there's top-line efficiency revenue growth, there's bottom line efficiency well removing redundancy step necessary customer. get lot clarity see u continue move forward go-to-market optimization next year beyond that. tyler radke -- analyst great. follow-up question, andrew, talked really strong net new customer addition within construction cloud, think, doubling year year. also saw make revenue accelerate 28% constant currency. help u understand, think reacceleration durable? sort thinking position there? what's driving strength new customer additions? andrew anagnost -- president chief executive officer, director first, let comment make revenues, going go construction. so, make revenue also includes revenue pix thing associated that. however, let's talk fact around construction business think important, right?

         "Rohit Chopra may not have much time left as director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, with Donald Trump preparing to assume the presidency. But the regulator has been making the most of his likely final months on the job, telling Congress recently he didn’t think there was any reason for the agency to act like a “dead fish.” This week, the CFPB took a flurry of small actions involving the credit card industry. Among the actions: It warned companies that devaluing customers’ points might be illegal and released a study knocking retail credit cards for offering particularly high interest rates. It also debuted a new credit card comparison tool using data the agency collects that, in theory, could offer an alternative to commercial sites that it argues often rely on kickbacks or affiliate marketing. In an interview on Thursday, Chopra told Yahoo Finance that the credit card industry has a growing price-gouging problem and shared some of his thoughts on regulations that may be needed to curb it — even if it may be a while before another Democrat has a chance to implement them. Below is a transcript of the interview, which has been edited for length and clarity. Weissmann : I want to take a step back. In general, how would you describe the way the credit card industry is currently treating consumers? Is its whole business model fundamentally problematic or are there just a bunch of discrete issues that need better regulation, in your view? Chopra : I think the most noteworthy shift in recent years has been what many would consider price gouging. Very importantly, we have seen a shift in the margins on credit card interest rates. In other words, when you look at the cost of funds for big credit card issuers, and you look at other factors like consumer credit profiles, we’re seeing much fatter margins. And in some ways credit cards have been more expensive than at any time in recent history. So just to put a finer point on it: Even when you consider [the Fed’s] interest rate hikes, those credit card interest rates went well beyond that. The net result is that as consumers were walking down the aisle and wondering why things like diapers were so expensive, when they were swiping those purchases with a credit card, they were once again getting hit with high prices. Weissmann : What is your theory about why those margins have gotten so much fatter? What's allowing them to engage in “price gouging,” as you put it? Chopra : There's a whole host of reasons and we've looked at many of them. Some of them range from real in-the-weeds type practices, like how they've changed their credit reporting to obscure to their competitors who their most profitable customers are , to things that are much more in the open. And one of those things is the major role that rewards cards have now played in the market. You now see that rewards cards are not just being marketed to higher-income, prime borrowers. You're seeing it penetrate across the marketplace. Consumers are really looking at choosing a credit card based on the rewards. That’s created a market environment where the interest rate itself is less salient, and the interest rates that people are paying often wipe out way more than the value of the rewards. We've looked at this also from other angles, including how so many non-financial companies have essentially turned into credit card companies. We have department stores out there that are largely staying afloat because they're churning credit cards. Weissmann : You guys put out this credit card comparison tool. When I went online and tried it out, what struck me initially is that you can’t compare rewards very well on it, which is what most credit card shoppers — like you said — are interested in. What it does make easy is comparing the APR. I’m curious, was that intentional? Was that a way of signaling people should care more about interest rates? Or was it a limitation of the data? Chopra : So here is what I would say about the tool. As you can tell, it’s not so fancy. But what we're really trying to do is make the data public. Based on what we've done the past few years, we’re ordering companies to require data and then allowing people to visualize it with the goal that third-party comparison sites will also make use of this data. And it's going to be updated periodically. But you're right that the way consumers are looking at it now, it's mostly based on rewards, and I’m really concerned that the structure of credit cards today creates a financial incentive for credit card companies to push consumers into a treadmill of debt. Because when you’re signing up for a credit card, it’s typically a time when you feel you can pay off your balance month to month, and that means the interest rate is a lot less salient. You're then focused on the sign-up bonus for the rewards, which is very natural. And what we find is that when people start paying interest on credit cards, we are not seeing those credit card issuers fess up to consumers that they can switch to a card with a lower rate. The fundamental issue is credit card companies profit when people get into debt. Weissmann: There are obviously a lot of these comparison tools online. Why do you feel like we need another one? Chopra: We’ve done work and issued policy about rigged comparison sites. We think comparison tools are very important, but when the results are rigged, it ends up steering consumers into cards that may simply be profitable for the comparison website. And manipulated results are something that we've been increasing our scrutiny over. I’ll give one example: You have a lot of airline points websites, not operated by airlines, operated by third parties who are actually making enormous sums of money through commissions and kickbacks from credit card companies. So part of it was again trying to make the data available so that there is some unbiased data set and that there is at least someplace where people can go where it's not skewed. Are we expecting tons of eyeballs on this? No, but we have found that making the data public so that it can be used and power other sorts of tools is really important. Weissmann: You put out a report arguing that retailers are essentially responsible for a disproportionate share of the problems and bad debt in the industry. Do you think retail credit cards need more specific regulations? Chopra: One of the places that we have heard a lot from is retail workers. I've also heard this from flight attendants and others that an increasing amount of their compensation is now tied to whether or not they can push credit cards on customers. When that moves into high-pressure tactics and quotas, that can often be a recipe for what we saw at places like Wells Fargo, that even created fake accounts. So trying to make sure that there isn't too much pressure or coercion on frontline workers to push these cards, I think, could be something that we continue to do. Weissmann: Donald Trump talked about imposing a cap on credit card interest rates during his campaign. Do you think that would be an appropriate move? Chopra: I do think that there's a growing consensus about the need for interest rate caps. We've done research to show that the rates that are being charged by the largest and most dominant credit card issuers are substantially higher than credit card issuers that may not be popular name brands. We've also looked at credit unions who are subject to a federal rate cap on their credit cards and many of them have very robust businesses. So I think that's something that the incoming administration is clearly interested in and I think that's going to be a place where there's going to be more bipartisan discussion.

         "Boeing Co. BA is back in the spotlight after a Boeing 737-800 operated by South Korea’s JejuAir crashed at Muan International Airport on Sunday, tragically killing 179 of 181 passengers and raising fresh questions about the aerospace manufacturer's safety record. What Happened : The crash comes amid Boeing’s ongoing challenges, including a 30% stock decline in 2024 and production restrictions imposed by federal regulators following January’s Alaska Airlines door plug incident on a 737 MAX aircraft, reported Associated Press on Sunday. JejuAir’s shares plunged 7.67% to 7,570 ($5.14) South Korean won following the crash, while Boeing’s stock, already down 28.22% year-to-date, faces uncertain trading as markets process the incident’s implications. Aviation consultant and former Delta Air Lines chief pilot Alan Price emphasized that the 737-800 involved in Sunday’s crash differs from the troubled MAX variant, calling it “a very proven airplane” with a strong safety record. “We are in contact with Jeju Air regarding flight 2216 and stand ready to support them. We extend our deepest condolences to the families who lost loved ones, and our thoughts remain with the passengers and crew,” Boeing wrote on X on Sunday. pic.twitter.com/TIrIUBw4RB See Also: Veteran Investor Bets Big On S&P 500 Hitting 7,000 By End Of 2025: These Sectors Could Lead The Charge Why It Matters : The incident adds to Boeing’s recent setbacks, including a seven-week machinists strike that disrupted production of key aircraft models and January’s FAA manufacturing oversight restrictions. The company has struggled to rebuild its reputation following two fatal 737 MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people and led to $23 billion in losses. Under new leadership since CEO David Calhoun ‘s departure in August, Boeing has initiated safety improvement discussions among 70,000 employees. The cause of Sunday’s crash remains under investigation by South Korean authorities. Market analysts note that while distinct from previous 737 MAX issues, the crash could further impact investor confidence in Boeing as it competes with European rival Airbus for market share in the commercial aviation sector. Price Action : Boeing Co.’s stock is trading down 4.15% at $173.50 during Robinhood’s overnight trading service. On Friday, the stock closed at $180.72, up 0.19% for the day, before edging higher by 0.10% in after-hours trading to $180.90. Year to date, Boeing’s stock has fallen significantly, down 28.22%, according to data from Benzinga Pro . Boeing has a consensus price target of $197.85 from 23 analysts, with a high of $260 and a low of $85. The latest ratings from JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, and RBC Capital average $158.33, implying a 12.47% downside. Boeing’s 30-day average trading volume stands at 10.71 million shares, with a 52-week range of $137.03 to $264.66. The company has a market capitalization of $135.34 billion, and its 14-day Relative Strength Index is at 77.4, indicating overbought conditions.
